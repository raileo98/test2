  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Choi Hung Estate will be redeveloped in three phases, with the first batch of affected residents set to be relocated in about four years’ time, according to a paper submitted by housing authorities on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The redevelopment plan’s timeline was unveiled in the paper submitted to the Wong Tai Sin District Council, in which the Housing Department said the first phase would involve three blocks – Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House – as well as two vacant school sites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The new Mei Tung estate, which is expected to start taking in residents in 2028-29, will provide 2,450 units for the first phase of relocation, accommodating about one-third of the affected Choi Hung Estate residents," the paper said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the area in the first phase is cleared out, construction will begin immediately and will be able to provide about 3,200 units to residents of four blocks affected by the second stage of redevelopment, expected to take place from 2035-36.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area involved in the second phase will then be able to take care of the last batch of households. These residents will move into some 4,100 newly built units between 2042 and 2043.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The relocation process would take roughly 15 years, the department added, and by 2048, the last phase of the estate is expected to be redeveloped to offer 1,900 flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In total, the new Choi Hung Estate will be able to accommodate 9,200 households, up from the current 7,400.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say the redevelopment would also provide an opportunity to improve traffic conditions at the Choi Hung Interchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Housing Authority has begun discussions with relevant departments to free up part of the Choi Hung Estate site to alleviate traffic congestion in the area,” it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Built in the 1960s, the estate is famous for its rainbow colour theme.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-19 spaceflight mission have entered the Tiangong space station and met with three others, starting a new round of in-orbit crew handover.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-18 crew opened the hatch at 12.51pm on Wednesday (Beijing time) and greeted the new arrivals, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The six crew members then took group pictures for the fifth space get-together in China's aerospace history. They will live and work together for about five days to complete planned tasks and handover work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-19 astronauts – Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze – will stay at the Tiangong space station for approximately six months and conduct a series of experiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-19 blasted off early Wednesday morning atop a Long March-2F rocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China declared the launch a "complete success".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-18 crew, meanwhile, is set to return to Earth on Monday. (Reporting by Xinhua)

  <img alt="HKU researchers say that those with diabetes are twice as likely to get colorectal and liver cancers compared to healthy people.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The University of Hong Kong on Wednesday said diabetes patients can lower the risk of getting colorectal and liver cancers, the second and fifth most common in the SAR, by controlling their blood glucose levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Faculty of Medicine conducted two territory-wide analyses using 17 years of Hospital Authority data involving 140,000 diabetes patients.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It found that by controlling blood glucose levels, such patients can lower the chances of getting colorectal cancer by 28 percent, and liver cancer by 30 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cancer cells, when they have a lot of sugar around them, they are able to grow faster. This is in essence the way which patients with diabetes, if it is poorly controlled, they will have an increase risk of both bowel cancer and liver cancer," explained the university's Dr Walter Seto, who led the project.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media briefing, Seto added that those with diabetes are twice as likely to get these cancers compared with healthy individuals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dr Paul Lee, who specialises in endocrinology and diabetes, told RTHK that patients can improve their blood glucose levels through a good diet and more exercise.

  <img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776876_1_20241030170539.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the debut of Saudi Arabia's first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Hong Kong-listed equities will strengthen cooperation between the two places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan's remark came as trading of such ETFs began on the Saudi stock exchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Issuer Albilad Capital and its partner CSOP Asset Management said the trading of the product raised more than US$1.2 billion at the start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters in Riyadh after the listing ceremony, Chan said the ETFs open doors for Middle Eastern investors to capital markets beyond the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Middle Eastern investors can gain easy access to our Hong Kong markets. However, this investment extends beyond just Hong Kong. As you know, more than 70 percent of the market value of listed companies in Hong Kong comes from the mainland. Therefore, investing in the Hong Kong market is equivalent to investing in key sectors of the mainland," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asia's first ETF covering Saudi Arabian stocks made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last November. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

   Hong Kong’s stock market operator on Wednesday said it will open an office in Riyadh next year, boosting its global coverage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said the new office in the Saudi Arabian capital would help investors in the Middle East better access financial products and capital markets in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its CEO Bonnie Chan pointed out that the Riyadh branch will join HKEX’s other offices in Beijing, Shanghai, London, New York, and Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The new Riyadh office will enable us to foster greater global coverage and facilitate access for Middle East clients to Asia’s most international, diverse and liquid capital markets in Hong Kong."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement came as the trading of Saudi Arabia’s first exchange-traded fund that tracks Hong Kong-listed shares kicked off.

   The Development Bureau on Wednesday said about 5,600 people have visited an exhibition showcasing the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on social media, it said the people who were trying to catch a glimpse of the bones displayed at the Heritage Discovery Centre at Kowloon Park included students and tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that temporary studios and showrooms at the centre will open by the end of the year, and visitors would even be able to watch paleontologists prepare fossils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau also said that mainland and local experts are still carrying out excavation work on Port Island, where the fossils were found.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that the team had to carry generators and excavation tools to the island, in the northeastern waters of the SAR, as there is no electricity supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities added that apart from collaborating with mainland experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, they are also contacting local experts for future research and education endeavours.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The mainland is set to issue one-off permits to allow Hong Kong newborns to travel there, according to DAB chairman Gary Chan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said on Wednesday that DAB lawmakers have received calls for help from parents saying they had hoped to travel across the border with their newborns, but applications for temporary mainland travel permits take at least five working days to process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a letter to Chan, national immigration officials said parents of Hong Kong-born babies "with urgent need to travel to the mainland" can get a one-off permit at Luohu, Huanggang, Shekou or Shenzhen airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parents will be required to provide their newborn's identity document and birth certificate for the permit valid for one return trip between Hong Kong and the mainland within a three-month period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As long as the parents need a permit, they can bring the relevant documents to the four border crossings to apply for a document and collect it on the spot. It is more convenient and quicker than before, and can meet the needs of parents with newborns," Chan said, adding that he hoped the new arrangement could be extended to other border control points.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said the number of domestic violence cases handled by social welfare officials has fallen in recent years, but there's been a rise in the number of children in need of protection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to lawmakers, welfare minister Chris Sun said that overall, domestic violence cases dropped by 13.5 percent from 2019 figures, to nearly 3,400 last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But child protection cases rose by 45 percent in the same period, to more than 1,450.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These cases were referred to the Social Welfare Department for follow-up action after reports were filed to the police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said for cases considered to be high risk by police officers, the department makes a crisis intervention and provides a wide range of support, including psychological help, as well as centres for family crisis support, refuges and residential and daily child care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that some people who refuse help are given a card with the details of other places they can seek assistance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are promotional campaigns from the department and the police encouraging people to seek help early and avoid resorting to violence, the minister said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they firmly opposed new rules announced by the US Treasury that will prohibit US-headquartered firms, citizens, and permanent residents from engaging in transactions involving cutting-edge technology with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The restrictions will take effect on January 2, targeting investments in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China firmly opposes the United States issuing final rules on investment restrictions on China and has lodged stern representations with the United States," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States has generalised the concept of national security," the statement said, calling the restrictions a "typical non-market practice".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rules will "damage the interests" of firms in both China and the United States, the statement warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China "reserves the right to take measures", it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US Treasury assistant secretary for investment security Paul Rosen had said in a statement that the areas targeted by the latest US curbs "are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors will also be required under the rules to inform authorities about investments in some less advanced technologies that could threaten US national security, the department added. (AFP)

    New offence planned to tackle abandoned cars

  <img alt="The government says current legislation lets owners abandon unwanted vehicles on roads and in public spaces. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776816_1_20241030120311.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Transport officials say they have come up with a way to help stop people dumping cars they no longer want in alleys and at the side of roads, by plugging a loophole that lets owners off the hook if they stop renewing a vehicle's licence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At present, a vehicle's registration is automatically cancelled if it hasn't had a valid licence for two years. The person whose name the vehicle is registered under can then no longer be held liable for anything related to it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some irresponsible owners take advantage of this arrangement and abandon their unwanted vehicles on public roads and public back alleys, causing environmental hygiene and congestion issues," the Transport and Logistics Bureau says in a paper to Legco.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To address the matter, the bureau is proposing an amendment to road traffic regulations which would scrap the automatic cancelling of a vehicle's registration and instead enable officials to send owners a notice after two years, giving them three months to either renew their licence or take action to de-register the vehicle themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Options for de-registration include having the vehicle scrapped, or shipping it out of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau is proposing fines of up to HK$10,000 and prison terms of up to three months for people who ignore the notices, with a subsequent conviction for the same offence leading to fines of up to HK$25,000 and jail terms as long as six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the fines go unpaid, the authorities would refuse to issue or renew the offender's driving licence or to license any vehicle in their name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau said a commencement date for the proposed new offence is expected to be fixed by notice in the Gazette in the fourth quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK he welcomes the proposed changes, saying they could put a stop to vehicles being dumped.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They will impose a penalty which is more expensive than scrapping the car. So I think that's a good way to avoid people abandoning a car after the licence expires," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmaker Gary Zhang said he thinks there should be exemptions in some cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If a situation doesn't really involve illegal abandonment, for example, some car owners may simply not renew their registration due to personal reasons, or they don't plan to drive any more, or just park in their garage, I think the government shouldn't interfere too much," he said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Anthony Volpe smashed a grand slam as the New York Yankees avoided being swept in the World Series on Tuesday with an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Volpe's third-inning home run gave the Yankees a 5-2 edge, their first lead since game one, and later homers by Gleyber Torres and Austin Wells sparked New York's rout.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees pulled within 3-1 in the best-of seven Major League Baseball championship showdown with game five on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series, but the Yankees became the first team in 54 years to force a fifth game when down 0-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York denied the Dodgers an eighth World Series title and first since 2020 while keeping alive hopes of the Yankees winning their first crown since 2009 and 28th overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a record-shattering night for Los Angeles first baseman Freddie Freeman, who smashed a two-run homer in the first inning to become the first player with homers in the first four games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who blasted a walk-off grand slam to win game one, also moved past George Springer to set a record with homers in six consecutive World Series contests, counting the last two games from his 2021 title run with Atlanta. (AFP)

    Growing interest in trading in own currency, says FS

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between Beijing and Riyadh.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   An astrophysicist said the country's first civilian female astronaut, who joined the Shenzhou-19 spaceship, will inspire young women to join fields typically dominated by men.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang Haoze was among three astronauts who blasted off to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quentin Parker, director of Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that having the nation's only female spaceflight engineer onboard is significant towards the development of gender equality among industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We had a couple of missions back, we had the first civilian taikonaut who went up, Professor Gui [Haichao] from Beihang University, in Beijing. He was the first person that wasn't from the Chinese People's Liberation Army to actually go to space... Now we've got the first female flight engineer, which I think is an excellent thing," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think, as a role model for young Chinese women aspiring to get into what traditionally has been a male domain of engineering, more and more females are occupying all areas of technology opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apart from carrying out 86 science research and technology tests, the trio's mission also includes installing protective devices against space debris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Space debris is becoming more and more of an existential threat to everything in low Earth orbit, actually. And what that is, is you're (going to get) the threat of cascading catastrophic collapse of the environment in low Earth orbit," Parker said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The astrophysicist believes that the Chinese space station, which he said is only a third of a size of the international space station, will be expanded in the next couple of years.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris warned against Donald Trump's bid to seize "unchecked power" in a fiery speech on Tuesday at the spot where her rival riled up a mob before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are," Harris told a huge crowd of flag-waving supporters against the imposing backdrop of the White House in Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The campaign claimed 75,000 people attended the rally, which comes just a week before the current Democratic vice president faces the Republican former president in the closest and most volatile election of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number could not be immediately verified, but the crowd was unusually big in an election that has already seen heavy enthusiasm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of the Ellipse – a park linking the White House to the vast National Mall – was a direct attempt by her campaign to remind voters of the chaos caused by Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Trump urged supporters in a speech there to "fight like hell," many then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, in an assault that left 140 police officers wounded and shocked the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of venue – the White House lit up against the night in the background – was also a symbolic pitch to show Harris ready for the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking from behind bulletproof screens next to blue signs saying "Freedom," Harris pledged to be a "president for all Americans" – unlike Trump, whom she accused of wanting to jail his enemies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And although her speech began with the dramatic put-down of Trump's behavior, she soon pivoted to a recap of her detailed plans to help financially struggling middle class Americans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She got one of the biggest cheers when she referred to Republicans' drive to curtail abortion, saying the government should not be "telling women what to do with their bodies."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The crowd extended far beyond the Ellipse, across the Mall and all the way up to the iconic Washington Monument obelisk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although there is almost a week to go, the Harris campaign cast the speech as a "closing argument" – a nod to her career as a prosecutor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think of this as a cleansing for what happened on January 6," said Mitzi Maxwell, 69, who came from Florida with her mother to see "all the love and passion and excitement that she (Harris) has become known for."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some Harris supporters queued for more than seven hours before the speech, whose sheer scale and energy was a direct challenge to Trump, a politician who has always boasted about his ability to draw crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Harris spoke in Washington, Trump visited a heavily Hispanic city in Pennsylvania, two days after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comments about Puerto Rico drew outrage at the New York rally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Ricans are the largest Hispanic group in Pennsylvania, the most crucial battleground state to win as it holds the highest number of Electoral College votes of the seven battleground states, according to the Census Bureau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I’d like to begin with a very, very simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans," Trump said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Premier League strugglers Southampton squeezed into the English League Cup quarter-finals when James Bree struck a late winner to down Championship side Stoke 3-2 on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And another Premier League team, Brentford, also survived a major scare against second-tier rivals, beating Sheffield Wednesday on penalties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At St Mary's, Southampton were sailing into the next round after Taylor Harwood-Bellis' header and Adam Armstrong's spot-kick inside 35 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But goals from Ashley Phillips and Tom Cannon threatened to force a penalty shoot-out until defender Bree rifled home from 25 yards with two minutes left on the clock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Southampton were fortunate to reach that stage still level as only a goal-line clearance from Yukinari Sugawara stopped Stoke substitute Million Manhoef completing the turnaround minutes earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saints boss Russell Martin, who was serving a touchline ban after collecting a third booking of the campaign, made six changes to the starting XI which began Saturday's 1-0 loss at Manchester City, leaving the team footing the table with a solitary point from nine outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the night's other encounter, Brentford were bossing the show against Sheffield Wednesday after taking the lead through Kevin Schade in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wednesday levelled shortly before the hour with their first effort on target through Djeidi Gassama's spectacular strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford could not find a winner in normal time with Mark Flekken their hero, the goalkeeper saving Liam Palmer's penalty to send the hosts through 5-4 after a 1-1 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went to the wrong side twice at the start of the shoot-out," commented Flekken. "That doesn't help your confidence in a shoot-out but luckily I saved the last one".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holders Liverpool are away to Brighton on Wednesday with beaten finalists Chelsea at Newcastle. (AFP)

   Qatar's Akram Afif was named Asian Football Confederation men's player of the year on Tuesday, while Japan's Kiko Seike took home the women's award.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Afif led Qatar to the Asian Cup title at the start of the year, being named player of the tournament and winning the golden boot with eight goals – including a hat-trick against Jordan in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second time the 27-year-old had been named Asian player of the year. He also won the prize in 2019 after winning the Asian Cup with Qatar for the first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif, who had stints in Belgium and Spain earlier in his career, also led club side Al Sadd to a domestic double in Qatar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to thank my wife, teammates and all the national team coaches and administrative staff," he said at the AFC award ceremony in Seoul. "I will try my best to win this award for a third time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif became the third player to win the award more than once, following in the footsteps of Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata and Uzbekistan's Server Djeparov.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seike won the women's prize after scoring 20 goals to help Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies win the Japanese domestic title for a second straight year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Seike was also influential as Urawa won the Asian club title, and was part of the Japan squad that reached the quarter-finals at the Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very happy to receive this prestigious award," said Seike, who joined England's Brighton in July. "I will continue to do my best for my club, the national team and to raise the value of Asian football." (AFP)

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent

  <img alt="China-made Teslas will be taxed an addition 7.8 percent, Chinese car giant Geely faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776781_1_20241030075912.jpg&q=30" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commerce Ministry said China "does not approve of or accept" the move, according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A ministry spokesperson added that Beijing has already appealed to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

    Israel faces backlash over UN agency ban

  <img alt="UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776747_1_20241029213623.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel faced an international backlash on Tuesday after its parliament approved a bill banning the main United Nations aid agency for the devastated Gaza Strip.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite global concerns, including from Israel's ally the United States, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from working in Israel and annexed east Jerusalem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UNRWA has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades, and is the largest aid provider in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel controls all humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza, where its forces have been fighting Palestinian militant group Hamas for more than a year. It is unclear how the agency will continue to operate there, and aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmakers also passed a measure prohibiting Israeli officials from working with UNRWA and its employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses UN facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the UN agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and UNRWA, and Israel cannot put up with it," lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said in parliament as he presented the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several of Israel's Western allies voiced disquiet at the ban, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying Britain was "gravely concerned."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany, which has been a staunch defender of Israel's security, warned it would "effectively make UNRWA's work in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem impossible... jeopardising vital humanitarian aid for millions of people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work “would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said UNICEF “would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies" such as vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UN chief Antonio Guterres said the Israeli law could have "devastating consequences" if implemented, while UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned that the vote "sets a dangerous precedent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media that Israel was "ready" to continue providing aid to Gaza "in a way that does not threaten Israel's security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ban comes as fighting rages in Gaza and Lebanon, where a second full-scale front opened last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90 percent of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. (AP/AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris will urge Americans to turn the page on Donald Trump as she delivers her closing election argument on Tuesday on the spot where her Republican rival rallied supporters before the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With polls in a dead heat one week before Election Day, Harris’ campaign said she chose the symbolic site to push her case that the Republican former president is a threat to American democracy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said in a statement that the former prosecutor would deliver a "major closing argument" and "make the case that it is time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new way forward.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A senior campaign official said Harris will also deliver an "optimistic and hopeful" message, amid rumblings in the party that she is focusing too much on Trump and not enough on her own policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris will address some 20,000 people on the Ellipse, a park outside the White House where Trump delivered a fiery speech in which he ramped up his false claims that he won the 2020 election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump supporters then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, in an assault that left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Trump, who, at 78, is the oldest presidential candidate in US history, will be trying to take the sting out of Harris' big event by delivering remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will then rally in blue-collar Allentown in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump gave his closing arguments at a mass rally at New York's Madison Square Garden at the weekend, where some of the other speakers used language widely condemned as racist and sexist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both candidates will keep up a punishing schedule in the final days until November 5, sometimes hitting three or more states in one day. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nato and South Korea have expressed alarm that North Korean troops could soon be joining Moscow's side in the Ukraine-Russia war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato said on Monday thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line, a development which has prompted Kyiv to call for more weapons and an international plan to keep those troops at bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Western leaders said North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers – up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday – to help Russia’s military campaign, and warned that its involvement in a European war could also unsettle relations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had talked with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and told him that 3,000 North Korean soldiers are already at military bases close to the Ukranian front line, and that he expects that deployment to increase to 12,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This war is becoming internationalised, extending beyond two countries," Zelenskiy said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation," Zelensky said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yoon told Zelensky that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war, it would pose a "great threat" to South Korea's security, his office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia's war. Neither Putin nor Pyongyang has denied North Korean troops are in Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Moscow said on Tuesday it had seized the war-battered mining town of Selydove in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv's forces are buckling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow also said it had wrested control of the nearby villages of Bogoyavlenka, Girnyk and Katerynivka, also in the Donetsk region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed was formally part of Russia in late 2022, the year Moscow started the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The gains announced by Moscow on Tuesday are just the latest in a string of Russian advances that have gained momentum since February with the collapse of Ukraine's defences in the stronghold town of Avdiivka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the same time, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui arrived in Russia's far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no plans to meet her. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain's Carlos Alcaraz opened his campaign at the Paris Masters on Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Chilean Nicolas Jarry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After receiving a bye through the first round, Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead in his round of 32 match but was reigned back in by Jarry, before eventually claiming the first set 7-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Alcaraz was in commanding form in the second set, giving his Chilean opponent only one game as he raced to victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been two years since I have won a match here in Paris – so every time that I keep going is a gift for me," said the 21-year-old Spaniard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really happy to get through the opening set, it was really important for me to come into the second with more confidence," he added. "I need time to get used to the speed of the court."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz is now the heavy favourite to win his first title on the hard court at Bercy Arena after Italian world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament earlier on Tuesday due to an intestinal virus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will face either Frenchman Ugo Humbert or American Marcos Giron in the round of 16. (AFP)

    Shenzhou-19 blasts off for Tiangong space station

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Three Chinese astronauts including the country's only woman spaceflight engineer blasted off on a "dream" mission to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Tiangong team will carry out experiments with an eye to the space programme's ambitious goal of placing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 and eventually constructing a lunar base.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spacecraft Shenzhou-19 and its three crew lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 4.27am, according to state media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The space agency deemed the launch a "complete success", Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During the Shenzhou-19 flight ... 86 space sci-tech experiments will be carried out in the fields of space life sciences, microgravity physics, materials, medicine, new technologies," Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), said in a press conference on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of these experiments is expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which China hopes to complete by 2035, as it would in theory be more convenient than transporting building materials from Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bricks will be sent in a separate uncrewed cargo spaceflight to the Shenzhou-19 crew next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the crew on the Shenzhou-19 is Wang Haoze, 34, who is China's only female spaceflight engineer, according to the CMSA. She is the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like everyone else, I dream of going to the space station to have a look," Wang told a media gathering on Tuesday alongside her fellow crew members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to meticulously complete each task and protect our home in space," she said. "I also want to travel in deep space and wave at the stars."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Headed by Cai Xuzhe, the team will return to Earth in late April or early May next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cai, a 48-year-old former air force pilot, brings experience from a previous stint aboard Tiangong as part of the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having been selected for the new crew, taking on a new role, facing new tasks and new challenges, I feel the honour of my mission with a great responsibility," said Cai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The crew currently aboard the Tiangong space station is scheduled to return to Earth on November 4 after completing handover procedures with the incoming astronauts, CMSA’s Lin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of China's space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years as China built and began operating its "Tiangong" space station, officially completed in November 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crewed by teams of three astronauts that are rotated every six months, Tiangong is the programme's crown jewel. Beijing says it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq pushed to a record high on Tuesday despite a pullback in the Dow, as markets greeted a series of earnings from technology heavyweights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Google parent Alphabet rose in after-hours trading following its earnings report, which will be succeeded later this week by releases from Apple, Microsoft and others.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tech stocks are catching a bid," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that there has been "more good news than bad" today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.8 percent at 18,712,
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones declined 0.4 percent to 42,233, while the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent at 5,832.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hogan pointed to another decline in oil prices as supportive of stocks and noted that US Treasury bond yields were stable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month, another positive for stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Ford fell 8.4 percent after reporting solid third-quarter earnings, but lowering some of its full-year projections, implying a weaker fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Boeing shot up 1.5 percent after it announced it will raise more than initially expected from a new stock offering as it seeks to offset crushing production woes and a major strike. The aerospace giant now expects to raise at least US$21 billion from the campaign. (AFP)

  <img alt="Jamshid Sharmahd was a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident. File Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776746_1_20241029211738.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany and the European Union on Tuesday strongly condemned Iran's execution of a 69-year-old German-Iranian dissident after years behind bars and warned they were considering retaliatory measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Jamshid Sharmahd's execution on Monday a "scandal" and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned Iran's "inhumane regime" of "serious consequences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi doubled down and poured scorn on her comments, writing on X that "a German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin summoned Iran's charge d'affaires to "convey its strong protest" at the execution. The German ambassador in Tehran also protested to the Iranian foreign ministry and was then recalled to Berlin for consultations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin "reserved the right to take further measures", the foreign ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc condemned Sharmahd's "killing in the strongest possible terms" and was also "considering measures in response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A European Commission spokeswoman told reporters that "any measures" could be taken against Iran and that they "have to be discussed with all member states".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd, a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident, was a software engineer who had worked and written for an Iranian opposition group's website based abroad that strongly criticised the Islamic republic's leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while travelling through the United Arab Emirates, according to his family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran accused him of having played a role in a deadly 2008 mosque bombing. He was sentenced to death in February 2023 for the capital offence of "corruption on Earth".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Iranian judiciary's Mizan website said on Monday that "the death sentence of Jamshid Sharmahd... was carried out this morning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His family have always vehemently protested his innocence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle said on X she was waiting for the German and US governments to provide "concrete proof" that her father had been killed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If so, she said, his body should be brought home "immediately" and the Iranian government should face "severe punishment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A German foreign ministry source said that Baerbock had spoken to Gazelle Sharmahd on Monday "and expressed condolences on behalf of the German government". (AFP)

   The European Commission on Tuesday said it had finalised discussions with Britain on an agreement that would allow both sides to cooperate directly in antitrust investigations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement is the first that would allow national competition authorities from EU countries to cooperate directly with a competition authority outside the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which comes into force after both the EU and Britain have finalised their ratification procedures, will set out that important antitrust and merger investigations are brought to each other's attention, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will also allow the coordination of investigations when necessary and set out the principles of cooperation, to avoid conflicts between jurisdictions. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Steve Bannon, a prominent right-wing figure and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, was released from prison early on Tuesday after spending nearly four months behind bars and just a week ahead of the US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon left a federal prison in Connecticut where he was serving time for a contempt of Congress conviction, several US media outlets reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not broken, I'm empowered," the 70-year-old told the New York Times outside the prison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When he entered prison on July 1, he defiantly said he was "proud" to serve time "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much has changed in US politics since then, with Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris replacing him as the Democratic nominee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon played a senior role in Trump's 2016 campaign and later served in the White House as chief strategist, leaving after seven months reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Though he no longer works officially for ex-president, he has continued to use his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a man on suspicion of murder after a 25-year-old woman's body was found in a shallow beach at the bottom of Waterfall Bay in Aberdeen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The male suspect's wife was also arrested for allegedly aiding an offender.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force said it had received a report at around 7:30am on Monday. Emergency personnel rushed to the scene, but the woman was pronounced dead on site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press briefing, superintendent Sin Kwok-ming said the victim was a domestic helper from Southeast Asia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She had injuries on the back of the head and forehead, but an autopsy will determine her exact cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial evidence suggested the woman arrived at the scene with the male suspect in a taxi late on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man then left alone about 30 to 40 minutes later, before heading to the mainland with his wife.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police eventually locked down their identities and arrested them when they returned to the city on Tuesday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin also explained why the case wasn't classified as a murder at the beginning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The arrested man's actions raise a lot of questions, like why the police weren't called right away and why he left Hong Kong immediately afterwards," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some evidence has also gone missing for no good reason. All these factors lead us to believe that the woman's death wasn't due to natural reasons."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin added the victim had known the man for some time, but was not employed by the suspect, a foreign national holding a Hong Kong identity card.

    RTHK programmes arouse interest, director says

  <img alt="Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung told a Legislative Council panel that RTHK has 3.8 million daily real-time streams and 500,000 daily visits to its website.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Efforts by Radio Television Hong Kong to promote its programmes are starting to bear fruit, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said on Tuesday as he noted a gradual shift in the way people receive their content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legislative Council panel meeting, several legislators raised concerns about the public broadcaster's performance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michael Luk of the Federation of Trade Unions praised the quality of RTHK programmes in recent years, but felt the organisation could do more to expand its reach.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course we understand RTHK is not a commercial radio or television station. But when it comes to delivering messages to a mass audience, it cannot be too nonchalant towards viewership and listenership," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Cheung said RTHK has already launched a promotional campaign, citing both outdoor and online advertisements which he said were effective.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giving the Paris Olympics and Paralympics as examples, he revealed the hit rates and viewership of RTHK's streaming platforms doubled during that period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung noticed a fundamental change in the media consumption pattern, saying many people are no longer glued to their TV sets, and instead rely on mobile devices for information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the RTHK website, every day we're seeing 3.8 million real-time streams, while our programmes are played 620,000 times and the website is accessed 500,000 times. We also record about 1.5 million daily views at our news website," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figures, he believed, are proof the broadcaster's programmes can arouse interest among the Hong Kong audience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Liberal Party’s Peter Shiu suggested RTHK team up with schools to produce content which educate students on national policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau pledged to take his recommendation into account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "RTHK has a strong focus on national education for youth and promoting Chinese culture. We will do more and consider lawmakers' ideas for raising national awareness and education," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau added RTHK will spare no effort to promote and broadcast the 15th National Games, scheduled for November next year. Hong Kong will host eight competitive events, including track cycling, fencing and golf.

    Smart food waste bins to debut in Tai Hang

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A project that encourages residents to recycle their food waste will soon kick off in Tai Hang, with organisers setting up smart bins in the neighbourhood with an expected reach of up to 1,000 households.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sponsored by the government’s Environment and Conservation Fund, the initiative will focus on 40 older single-block buildings and so called three-nil buildings – blocks that lack a residents’ organisation, owners corporation or property management – in the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five bins, sporting a purple colour scheme, will be set up in Tai Hang from November and will serve the community there until September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also have features such as fill-level detection and auto-deodorisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The New People's Party’s Jeff Wong, who is helping to coordinate the project, said organisers will also set up a street station there to collect food waste twice a week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are aiming for 700 to 1,000 households to use our scheme or use our recycling system,” he said after attending the scheme’s opening ceremony on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Later on, we will organise a lot of activities and events such as talks or workshops to educate the residents to use our recycling system,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As part of a pilot scheme last December, authorities installed smart food waste recycling bins at a number of private housing estates that were chosen through an application process.

    Pope's commission against abuse to publish 1st report

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Vatican on Tuesday will publish its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church, a move requested by Pope Francis amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors said its report will be a "first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting", and will document "where risks remain, and where advances can be found".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pope Francis set up the independent panel of experts in December 2014 amid an avalanche of revelations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy across the world, and its cover-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the commission has faced strong criticism over its organisation, funding and role, with several high-profile members quitting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2022, Francis incorporated the commission into the Roman Curia – the government of the Holy See – and asked for an annual, "reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first of these will be published on Tuesday, launched at the Vatican by the commission's president, US Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement ahead of the launch, the commission described the report as a "new tool", part of a process to set out clear standards on protecting children and vulnerable adults.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be divided into four areas – a review of safeguarding policies in 15 to 20 local churches each year, trends across continents, policies within the Vatican and the Church's broader role in society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It collects resources and practices to be shared across the Universal Church, and makes specific recommendations to promote further progress in safeguarding," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. (AFP)

    CE hopes NGO will review its care home operations

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed the hope that the Hong Chi Association will review the operations of its care homes, after a former staff member was charged for the alleged sexual assault of two intellectually impaired residents at its Tai Po facility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee described the incident – which Hong Chi said took place in August and saw the 38-year-old suspect sacked – as despicable, saying police should investigate the matter thoroughly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive noted that an independent review committee formed by the association should file a report over the matter as soon as possible to ensure that the interest of residents came first.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I hope the committee will look at the home’s overall operation, including the services it provides to residents, as well as effective management and supervision systems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There should be a comprehensive system for training, discipline and supervision of its staff. They must put the interests of the residents first."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said he thinks the Social Welfare Department did the right thing by cutting short the licence review period for the Tai Po home from three years to one.

    RainLily sees rise in reports of sexual offences

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rape crisis centre RainLily on Tuesday urged officials to reform laws on sexual offences and improve the city’s sex education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RainLily said the number of cases reported to the centre nearly doubled from just over 1,000 in 2009-2013 to almost 2,000 in 2019-2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also found a significant delay in help-seeking, with people waiting an average of around four years before asking the group for assistance in the past five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Doris Chong, the centre’s executive director, said it’s not easy for people to seek help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For example, they don't know how to seek help or where to seek help. Also, they don't know how to tell the incidents to others because they always think that it's a shame incident,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group also said many cases never get to court because complainants do not feel protected enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albert Yau, a senior research officer with RainLily, stressed the need for a more supportive environment to encourage victims to speak up.

   “There may be a lot of stigma attached to such incidents. So I think in order to encourage the victims to seek help promptly, we have to create a more friendly environment to tell them that you will be supported by us,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The centre wants the government to define “consent” more clearly in the law and to expand the scope of rape offences to better protect victims.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday hit out at the US government for finalising plans to ban American investments in AI and other advanced technology sectors in China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Treasury Department said overnight that a ban on investments in semiconductors, microelectronics and quantum information technologies will come into effect in January, citing national security concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Biden administration's move will be a two-edged sword, harming the interests of both China and the US.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It once again shows that American politicians seek their own political interests, undermining normal investment and trade, the free market and economic order. This will harm the global supply chain," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This harms the interests of others, as well as that of the US as a nation, its people and its companies. They will reap what they sow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The SAR government will defend its own interests and the interests of Hong Kong companies. We will also work with the country to protect national interests."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, the SAR government said it strongly opposes the proposed ban.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson noted that in the past decade, the US had enjoyed a trade surplus of US$271.5 billion with Hong Kong, the largest among its global trading partners, and the surplus would suffer because of Washington's move.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the chief executive said he will lead a delegation to Shanghai next Monday to attend the opening of the China International Import Expo, which will also host a dedicated session promoting investment in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said more than 300 Hong Kong companies will take part in the expo, making up of around a tenth of the total participating firms, adding that SAR officials will sign pacts with their Shanghai counterparts on several key projects.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings posted a 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as its wealth and wholesale banking benefited from slower-than-expected rate cuts while it embarks on one of the largest overhauls in its history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Europe's largest bank posted pretax profit of US$8.5 billion for the July-to-September period versus US$7.7 billion a year earlier. The result compared with a US$7.6 billion mean average of broker estimates compiled by HSBC.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-headquartered, Asia-focused bank also announced an additional share buyback of up to US$3 billion, on top of a US$6 billion buyback programme announced earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lender unveiled a roadmap for its sweeping restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery designed to control costs and improve efficiency. HSBC announced last week that it will merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into East and West, under a new leadership structure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will begin to implement these plans immediately," Elhedery said in an earnings statement, but further details will be disclosed in February next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HSBC kept its 2024 and 2025 near-term return on tangible equity goal – a performance target – at mid-teens for two years but said in the statement that the "the outlook for interest rates has changed, and been volatile". (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Government data on Tuesday showed that home prices dropped last month to their lowest level since August 2016.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Private residential prices in September were down 1.67 percent month-on-month and 12.5 percent year-on-year, according to the Rating and Valuation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rents, meanwhile, rose for the seventh consecutive month to reach a five-year high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eddie Kwok from CBRE Hong Kong said measures announced in the recent Policy Address, such as an adjustment to the maximum loan-to-value ratio for mortgages, helped stabilise prices in the past two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said prices are likely to bottom out soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yield-seeking investors may be a demand driver entering the residential market as residential prices reached a relatively low level, coupled with expected lower financing costs going forward," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said that rents, which were 5.8 percent higher in September year-on-year, are likely to continue to rise, but should moderate in the short term now that students from overseas have already moved into their new homes for the academic year.

   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will make use of the first discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong to attract more visitors, with officials planning to develop Port Island, where the bones were found, into a tourist attraction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials believe that more of these fossils might be found on the island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before the Executive Council meeting, Lee said excavation work is ongoing on Port Island, which has geological features he described as “spectacular”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery on Port Island is in the area of our Geopark... we actually have a very famous and spectacular spot, which is the volcanic hexagonal rock columns. And that is, I think, one of the strongest attractions for people who are interested in natural resources, natural heritage, and also enjoying the nature," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be making use of this opportunity to develop some special tourist lines so that they can look at, first of all, the volcanic hexagonal rock columns, as well as all the other attractions of our Geopark, and including some exhibitions of the dinosaur fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said authorities will make use of the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park for workshops and exhibitions, and set up long-term displays for people to learn about paleontology.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman homered for a record-tying third consecutive game and the Los Angeles Dodgers reached the brink of a World Series title by beating the New York Yankees 4-2 on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who smashed a walk-off grand slam to win the opener in Los Angeles, crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and Walker Buehler threw five shutout innings allowing only two hits to spark the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gives the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Major League Baseball championship series, meaning they can capture their first crown since 2020 by winning game four on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman matched Hank Bauer in 1958 and Barry Bonds in 2002 as the only players to homer in the first three games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers first baseman also matched George Springer's record of homers in five consecutive World Series contests, including the last two games of Freeman's 2021 title run with Atlanta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not been swept in a World Series since Cincinnati did it in 1976. The most recent World Series sweep was by San Francisco over Detroit in 2012.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers seek their eighth World Series title while the Yankees, with a record 27 crowns, chase their first World Series title since 2009.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's the 12th title showdown between two of baseball's most iconic teams, with the Yankees having beaten the Dodgers eight times and the Dodgers defeating New York three, including a 1963 sweep. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's only female spaceflight engineer will be among a fresh crew of three astronauts that will travel to the Tiangong space station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shenzhou 19 crewmember Wang Haoze will become the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang was introduced on Tuesday along with her fellow crewmates Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center before their scheduled blast off at 4.27am on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m full ready for the mission,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I would devote all my energy and focus and attention to this mission. Together with my colleagues we are about to explore the universe and space. With every sunrise and sunset, we’d like to make them the landmarks of our journey to the universe.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Manned Space Agency said the Shenzhou 19 team will carry out their mission before returning to Earth in "late April or early May next year".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many duties await the new crew including science and application tests, and installing protective devices against space debris. Wang said she was looking forward to conducting these tasks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I also would like to fly around in space and also wave towards the stars. I would also like to look back from space to see our planet Earth and our motherland.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xinhua News Agency said the Shenzhou-19 crew will complete an in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-18 trio and stay at the space station for about six months. During this time, they will witness the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and the Shenzhou-20 crewed spaceship and even celebrate the Lunar New Year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Song Lingdong said he wanted to send a special Spring Festival greeting from space.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For my first visit to space, I have this privilege to celebrate this important festival for Chinese people in space and on Earth. We can share the same moment of celebration and we can also send greetings for the Lunar New Year from space.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tiangong space station is the crown jewel of the nation's space programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has ramped up plans to achieve its space dream, with Beijing saying it aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030. (Additional reporting by AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A sports figure has welcomed the Justice Department's plan to set up a pilot scheme for a sports dispute resolution system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The idea was first unveiled in the recent Policy Address and comes amid a rise in the complexity of sports disputes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ronnie Wong, who chairs the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, said the move could save clubs time and money.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the arbitrators should meet certain criteria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First, they shouldn't have any conflict of interest with the cases that they're dealing with. Second, they must have experience in handling disputes related to the particular sports involved," Wong said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It would be better if it's something that they've done in the past, and they understand the sports."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said his association would be open to joining the pilot scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong Law Society president Roden Tong suggested on the same programme that the arbitration be carried out online, adding that the fees "wouldn't be a problem" for those involved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Basically the costs are very low, to the point that some [people] don't even charge a fee. For simple disputes, for example, some athletes may be very busy, or some associations don't have the time to come out and meet the parties involved," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the authorities will continue to hold test events at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said officials will learn from the experience of the first test run at the park last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said a second test event will be held at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, with a trial planned in the main 50,000-seat stadium in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The challenge of course is the dispersal of crowds after an event which will comprise of 50,000 spectators. That is a challenge we must take up boldly," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is also why I have been demanding different levels of drills, so as to test different elements of operational procedures, different areas of risks, and also to learn about the experiences of those who may eventually become the final spectators of the 50,000 audience."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government will draw up various contingency plans, including on how to deal with unstable weather and emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park is due to officially open in the first quarter of next year.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paolo Banchero had the best night of his career on Monday night, tying the Orlando Magic record for points in a half – scoring 37 in the first two quarters against the Indiana Pacers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He finished with a career-high 50 points to equal the fifth-highest scoring effort in Magic history. Orlando won 119-115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Man, I'm tired.” Banchero said after the first 50-point effort in the NBA this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero, the league's rookie of the year two seasons ago and an All-Star last year, was 13 of 17 from the field in the half and finished 16 of 26 from the floor. He also had 13 rebounds and nine assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It was just being in the zone,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Felt like I was in an open gym, back at home, just working on my game," he added. "Every shot felt like it was going in, and it's a good feeling when you've got a day like that. Not every game is going to be like that – but I'm glad today was.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37 points in the half tied the mark set by NBA legend Tracy McGrady, also in the first half, for Orlando against Washington in the game where he finished with 62.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That first half was a magical first half, for sure,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero's career-high entering Monday was 43 points, set January 3 against Sacramento. (AP)

    Rodri wins men's Ballon d'Or as Real Madrid boycott

  <img alt="Manchester City's Rodri with the Ballon d'Or. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776627_1_20241029081012.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri was awarded the men's Ballon d'Or on Monday after winning a fourth consecutive Premier League title and Euro 2024, but Real Madrid boycotted the ceremony.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The decision to award the prize for the world's best player to the deep-lying midfielder came as a surprise, with Real Madrid's Liga and Champions League double winner Vinicius Junior widely seen as the pre-ceremony favourite.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours before the festivities in Paris, the Spanish club announced its delegation would not attend the ceremony at Chatelet Theatre because of what it perceived as a snub of Vinicius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodri, 28, played a key role as City held off Arsenal to win the Premier League title last season and was named player of the tournament at Euro 2024 as unfancied Spain emerged triumphant in Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite the French organisers insisting that the identity of the winner was a closely-guarded secret this year, the news appeared to have leaked with Madrid announcing hours before the ceremony they would not attend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati earlier won her second successive women's Ballon d'Or, after leading her club to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claiming the Nations League with her country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drama started hours before the ceremony as Spanish and European champions Real said if Vinicius was not the winner, then the award should go to his teammate Dani Carvajal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Like the Brazilian, Carvajal scored in the 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final at Wembley.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If the award criteria doesn't give it to Vinicius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to Carvajal as the winner," Real Madrid told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or and Uefa does not respect Real Madrid – Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Madrid contingent of nominees also included Kylian Mbappé, Antonio Rudiger, Fede Valverde and Jude Bellingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the Ballon d'Or is chosen from the shortlist by an international jury of 100 specialist journalists. (AFP)

    Philadelphia prosecutor sues Musk group over giveaways

  <img alt="Election law experts say Elon Musk's giveaway may violate US federal law. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776613_1_20241029032140.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The district attorney of Philadelphia said on Monday that he has filed a lawsuit to halt Elon Musk's US$1 million giveaways as part of his political organisation's effort boosting Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suit by Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner is the first legal action to be brought over the sweepstakes offering US$1 million every day until November 5 to a person in a battleground state who has signed a petition supporting the Constitution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Krasner's office said the lawsuit, coming just over a week before Election Day, doesn't preclude potential criminal action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Philadelphia District Attorney is charged with protecting the public from public nuisances and unfair trade practices, including illegal lotteries. The DA is also charged with protecting the public from interference with the integrity of elections,” Krasner's office said in a statement published on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson for the billionaire tech mogul's America PAC (political action committee), emailed for comment on the lawsuit and asked if the cash awards would continue, responded with a link to an X post, which showed the latest US$1 million winner holding an oversized check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Delaware after casting his ballot Monday, US President Joe Biden called the giveaway “totally inappropriate.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Musk's giveaway requires entrants to sign a petition backing the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution and calls for them to serve as spokespeople for the organization as a condition of winning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The awards have carried on after election law experts raised questions that it violates federal law barring anyone from paying a person to vote or register to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement announcing the lawsuit, Krasner characterised the US$1 million prize as a “lottery,” which would make it more heavily regulated than if it were a prize or work-related. (AP)

    Thousands protest in Georgia after disputed vote

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tens of thousands of Georgians massed outside parliament on Monday night, demanding the annulment of the weekend parliamentary election that the president denounced as rigged with the help of Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rally deepened the political crisis in the South Caucasus country, where the governing Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “You did not lose the election,” President Salome Zourabichvili told the demonstrators who waved Georgian and European Union flags. “They stole your vote and tried to steal your future, but no one has the right to do that and you will not let anyone do that!”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giorgi Vashadze, leader of United National Movement coalition, said the opposition won't take part in any talks with the government and push for a new vote under international supervision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are not going to enter this parliament. We refuse all mandates,” he said. “We are not going to enter into any negotiations. We are going to fight until victory and we promise you, we will definitely win together.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Natia Chachava, who was wrapped in the Georgian flag, said the demonstrators “don’t want Russia, we don’t want to back to Russia or back to the Soviet Union.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU, the United States and NATO have all called for a full investigation of alleged irregularities in the Georgian election on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Georgian Dream and the electoral commission said the vote was free and fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Central Election Commission said the Georgian Dream party received 54.8 percent of the vote with almost all ballots counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin on Monday denied any Russian interference in the vote, saying it was the West, not Moscow, that was trying to destabilise the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We aren’t meddling in Georgia’s internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He countered that it was the West that had tried to influence the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili, a member of Georgian Dream, accused the president of creating “a coup scenario” that goes “against the constitutional order and democratic elections.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style “foreign influence law” passed in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks climbed on Monday at the start of a heavy week of earnings and economic data, while markets also monitor the finale of the US presidential campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts pointed to a pullback in oil prices as supportive of equities even though US Treasury yields pushed higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's just a continuation of good economic news," said Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer of FNBO, pointing to broadly higher earnings so far and expectations for additional easing of US monetary policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.7 percent at 42,387.57.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 4,823.52, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 0.3 percent to 18,567.78.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Markets are eyeing the earnings reports of major tech companies this week including Apple, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Others reporting results include McDonald's, ExxonMobil and Pfizer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US government will also be releasing its third quarter GDP growth estimate this week, as well as its monthly labour market report -- closely watched for its bearing on the central bank's interest rate policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, aviation giant Boeing, which announced a stock offering that is expected to raise up to $19 billion, saw its shares slide 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing last week reported a major quarterly loss and has been reeling from a workers' strike. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said taxes needed to rise to rebuild public services and fix the foundations of the economy, and challenged critics to spell out how they would tackle the country's "unprecedented" problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, finance minister Rachel Reeves will set out her first tax and spending plans which must address a difficult fiscal picture without raising major taxes on workers, cutting spending in priority departments or spooking investors with excessive borrowing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer, whose Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July, said in a speech on Monday that tough trade-offs were needed to "fix the foundations" of the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be realistic about where we are as a country... These are unprecedented circumstances," he said, noting his government, unlike its predecessors in 1997 and 2010, had to deal with both a weak economy and poor public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But I won't offer it as an excuse. I expect to be judged on my ability to deal with this," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Labour would borrow to drive growth and increase taxes to "prevent austerity and rebuild public services", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is looking to find around 40 billion pounds in tax rises and spending cuts to address the fiscal gap while putting more money into areas like health and education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he rejected the "fiction you can lower taxes (and) spend more on public services without making any changes".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shortly after the election, Reeves said the fiscal situation was worse than thought due to a 22 billion-pound (US$28.5 billion) black hole she said she had inherited from the previous Conservative government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves has said she will change the definition of public debt in the government's fiscal rules to allow it to borrow more to invest in the hope of speeding up economic growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to move to a situation where we invest in the future of this country," Starmer said. "I do not accept the proposition that it will have an impact on interest rates."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said 240 million pounds would be spent on helping people back into work, and a two pound cap on bus fares would be replaced by a three pound cap next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much of the build-up to the budget has been dominated by a debate over the definition of "working people".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government has pledged not to raise social security contributions paid by employees, but critics say working people might still bear the cost if the government increases the contributions paid by employers instead, or raises taxes on their savings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he was prepared to have a debate about the definition of working people but his chief concern was that there was "no more tax in their payslip."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conservatives have challenged the new government's assessment of the public finances, saying they are a pretext for tax rises that Labour had been planning already. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The social media network X on Monday suspended an account that published Hebrew-language messages on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, just days after it was opened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The account had a short notice reading "X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules," though the Elon Musk-owned platform did not specify which rule had been violated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei's office runs several social network accounts in his name, broadcasting messages in different languages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hebrew-language account had launched on the weekend with a message that is a common greeting in the Islamic world: "In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Most Merciful."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was opened after Israel carried out air strikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday in response to Tehran's missile attack on October 1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the attack which Iran said caused "limited damage" to a few radar systems. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu on sexual assault charges opened on Monday in the absence of the celebrity, who had declared himself to be ill.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, had said earlier that Depardieu, 75, was "extremely affected" by ill health, and that he had asked for proceedings to be delayed until he could attend in person.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unfortunately his doctors have forbidden him from appearing here today," the lawyer said on arrival for the trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said would ask the court for a six-month suspension of the trial, which comes after numerous other complaints and with a possible second court case already lying in wait.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's version of the #MeToo movement, triggered in 2017 by allegations against US producer Harvey Weinstein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu faces charges of abuse that allegedly occurred during a 2021 film shoot. The names of the two women accusing him have not been made public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of the plaintiffs, a set dresser now aged 55, reported in February that she had suffered sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults while filming director Jean Becker's "Les Volet Verts" ("The Green Shutters") in a private house in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect the justice system to be the same for everybody and for monsieur Depardieu not to receive special treatment just because he's an artist," the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Assous said that Depardieu's defence would offer "witnesses and evidence that will show he has simply been targeted by false accusations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He accused the plaintiff of attempting to "make money" by claiming 30,000 euros (US$32,500) in compensation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff told French investigative website Mediapart that Depardieu had started loudly calling for a cooling fan during the shoot because he "couldn't even get it up" in the heat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She claimed the actor went on to boast that he could "give women an orgasm without touching them".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff alleged that an hour later she was "brutally grabbed" by Depardieu as she was walking off the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor pinned her by "closing his legs" around her before groping her waist and her stomach, continuing up to her breasts, she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu made "obscene remarks" during the incident, she said, including: "Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She described the actor's bodyguards dragging him away as he shouted: "We'll see each other again, my dear".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My client expects that the justice system will find Gerard Depardieu to be a serial sexual assaulter," Durrieu-Diebolt said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second plaintiff in Monday's case, an assistant director on the same film, also alleges sexual violence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anouk Grinberg, an actor who appeared in "The Green Shutters", told AFP that Depardieu had used "salacious words... from morning till night".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When producers hired Depardieu to work on a film, they knew they were hiring an assaulter," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Grinberg said that in her experience, Depardieu had "always used sexual, smutty language" -- but that his behaviour had become "much, much worse, with permission from his profession, that pays him for it and covers up his offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 20 women have now accused Depardieu of various sexual offences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Actor Charlotte Arnould was the first to file a criminal complaint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A judge has yet to rule on a request from prosecutors in August for Depardieu to stand trial for raping and sexually assaulting her.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An investigation is also underway in Paris after a former production assistant accused Depardieu of a 2014 sexual assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And actor Helene Darras filed a sexual assault complaint that fell foul of the statute of limitations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish writer and journalist Ruth Baza has accused Depardieu of raping her in 1995.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Never, but never, have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote in an open letter published in conservative daily Le Figaro in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weeks later, President Emmanuel Macron shocked feminists by complaining of a "manhunt" targeting Depardieu, who he called a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Macron's remarks followed the broadcast by an investigative TV show of a recording of Depardieu making repeated misogynistic and insulting remarks about women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu is the biggest star to face accusations in French cinema's #MeToo movement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Directors Jacques Doillon and Benoit Jacquot are among the other major figures accused of sexual violence. (AFP)

    Agitator Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A UK judge on Monday jailed far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Some 6,000 people arrested but not charged during the 2019 protests could live normally, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed, while dismissing suggestions on setting a time limit for prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In newspaper interviews published on Monday, Lam said individuals under investigation for their acts during the social unrest were not bound by any restrictions, and could exercise their freedoms like anyone else.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The justice chief shot down calls to stop pursuing suspects after a certain period of time, clarifying there's no time limit on prosecution for "serious criminal cases".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Setting a deadline, he added, would be "inconsistent" with the principle of the rule of law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our decision to prosecute is based on existing evidence. But there were instances in the past...where there could be changes in circumstances or the emergence of new evidence in the future that's unknown to us, which might make it necessary to re-examine the prosecution decision," Lam explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His views were echoed by security minister Chris Tang, who was asked the same topic in a media interview on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dropping prosecution after a certain period of time, he said, was like "making things that are illegal lawful".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unless the law stipulates a time limit, we will initiate prosecution when there's evidence," Tang said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former police chief denied it was unfair to keep arrested individuals waiting for years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would only be wrong, he said, if law enforcement agencies have sufficient evidence but choose not to prosecute swiftly.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag, the Premier League club said on Monday, with the Old Trafford side 14th in the standings after nine games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men’s first-team manager," the club said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 54-year-old Dutchman's job was the subject of speculation for most of last season as United recorded their worst Premier League finish in eighth, and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, however, plus the fact Ten Hag was able to blame numerous injuries for their poor form earned Ten Hag another chance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He signed a new contract to extend his stay until 2026 and get another chance to restore the 20-times English league champions to former glories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Early results this season, however, suggested Ten Hag was not going to achieve that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to multiple British media reports, United will turn to Amorim, the 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon manager who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Sports reported United were prepared to pay Amorim's release clause.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe kept him on board following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the Premier League but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year extension of his contract to June 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But United have shown little improvement this season and the 2-1 loss at West Ham was the final straw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager," a statement by United read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future," it added. (Reuters/AFP)

   The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) is hoping to set up a new radar system to better monitor and predict severe weather across the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "phased array weather radar system" would provide detailed weather images that update quickly, helping to detect fast-changing weather conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environment and Ecology Bureau is seeking funding approval from Legco for HK$55 million to buy three sets of the radars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco panel meeting on Monday, Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the system would benefit the development of a low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Weather of course is important when it comes to low-altitude flying. This radar system could detect weather changes up to a few hundred metres above ground, So the weather radar system will help to enhance the safety of low-altitude vehicles and devices," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Together with an existing one in Sha Lo Wan, the proposed new radars in Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Tung Lung Chau would cover the whole territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to monitor "ionospheric scintillation" which affects drones, HKO's assistant director Chan Sai-tick said the observatory is using space weather data from the mainland and other countries and looking for ways to track ionosphere changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that the new radars offer higher resolution and faster updates, allowing more accurate predictions of severe weather such as hail and tornadoes.

   Cathay Pacific on Monday relaunched direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan taking the first flight servicing the two cities since the route was suspended in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flag carrier will operate three flights per week, as authorities push for more cooperation with Middle East countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan who was aboard flight CX647 is leading a delegation of over 100 representatives from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This symbolises a more frequent and direct people-to-people flow and also trade and cargo flow between the two regions. Cathay Pacific will be increasing its services to this region,” he said before boarding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[We are] opening up new markets, attracting new sources of capital, new sources of investment. This is an important move.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cathay’s chief customer and commercial officer, Lavinia Lau, said the carrier’s aim was to reach 100 worldwide destinations by next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Cathay received a good response from travellers on the resumption of direct flights to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The booking is pretty promising, at least for the first few flights… but going forward, we are also seeing a variety of travellers on our flights,” Lau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some of them originating from Hong Kong, a lot actually coming back from the other side, Saudi Arabia, to Hong Kong to visit, or going via Hong Kong to places like Japan to visit. We also see good traffic flows from Southeast Asia, via Hong Kong to Riyadh.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another passenger on the flight to Riyadh was Nelson. The startup worker said flying direct was much more convenient.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last time, I think we had to change from Qatar, so this is really convenient for us. It’s a direct flight. The difference is, first of all, time, and also it’s more convenient for business,” he told RTHK.

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.
