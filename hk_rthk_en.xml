  <img alt="John Lee says public housing tenants should be given a chance to climb the housing ladder. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775355_1_20241020125545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said giving public housing tenants a greater chance of buying Home Ownership Scheme units is a step towards helping them climb the housing ladder and should not be deemed unfair to the broader public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a TVB programme, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to pressure the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given that the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation primarily benefits well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who still need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of them happening under present market conditions are very low.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Sunday took over as president of the world's third-largest democracy after sweeping the country's election with policies like free meals for schoolchildren and with the outgoing leader's son as his running mate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 73-year-old former special forces commander won the February 14 contest with nearly 60 percent of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prabowo, wearing a traditional black hat and navy suit with a woven maroon and golden sarong, officially become Indonesia's eighth president on Sunday morning after he was sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesia's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping congratulated him on taking office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his message to Prabowo, Xi said China and Indonesia have traditionally been friendly neighbours, and the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year will create opportunities for further bilateral cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vice President Han Zheng, as Xi's special representative, attended the inauguration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Indonesian leader, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, said in a speech to lawmakers after taking his oath of office that he would be president for all Indonesians, even those who did not vote for him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said there were internal issues in the country that had to be grappled with, including corruption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Do we realise that our people and our children are malnourished? So many of our people don't have good jobs. So many of our schools are neglected," Prabowo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be courageous looking at all of this, and we have to be courageous solving all these problems."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was joined in the swearing-in ceremony by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flower boards set up outside the presidential palace congratulated Prabowo and Gibran, and thanked Jokowi for his decade as president.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi supporters also attended celebrations to bid farewell to Indonesia's outgoing leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anneta Yuniar, a bystander who had excitedly waved at Jokowi's motorcade as it slowly made its way past supporters before the ceremony, said she would miss Jokowi but that Prabowo was a strong leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Prabowo will continue the development that Jokowi started. There's continuity. It's what I want," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics also say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

    Soto home run puts Yankees in World Series

  <img alt="Juan Soto's three-run blast helps the Yankees finish off the Guardians in the American League Championship Series.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Baseball’s biggest brand is going back to October’s main stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Juan Soto hit a three-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning and the New York Yankees advanced to their 41st World Series – and first in 15 years – by beating the Cleveland Guardians 5-2 in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) on Saturday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto, who was acquired in a seven-player trade with San Diego in December, moved the Bronx Bombers into position with one big swing. He also caught the final out of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’re right where we belong,” said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who pulled off the deal for Soto.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to win their 28th title against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers. Game 6 of the National League Championship Series is on Sunday at Dodger Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 10th, Austin Wells walked with one out and Alex Verdugo followed with a grounder to second baseman Andrés Giménez, whose soft toss to the bag was dropped by rookie shortstop Brayan Rocchio for an error.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gaddis struck out Gleyber Torres and had Soto in a 1-2 count before New York’s stylish outfielder sent a shot over the wall in centre. Soto danced down the first-base line and paused to celebrate with his teammates before circling the bases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was just saying to myself, `You’re all over that guy. You’re all over that guy. He ain’t got anything,’” said Soto, who moved alongside his manager, Aaron Boone, as the only New York players to homer in an extra-inning, series-clinching win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto is eligible for free agency this winter, and Yankees fans chanted “Re-sign Soto!” during the post-game festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer and was named ALCS MVP as the Yankees took care of the Guardians in five games. It wasn’t easy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York won the first two at Yankee Stadium without much fanfare or any major drama. However, it was a different story in Cleveland as all three games at Progressive Field were nail-biters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians rallied to win Game 3 on two, two-run homers in their last two at-bats, and the Yankees held on to win Game 4 after blowing a four-run lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This was a roller coaster and we were able to just keep punching back,” Stanton said. “We know there’s much more work to do and it’s only uphill from here and we got to get it done.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland just didn’t have enough and a surprising season under first-year manager Stephen Vogt ended just short of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The franchise remains without a title since 1948, baseball’s current longest drought. (AP)

  <img alt="Warner Cheuk says the government could explore ideas such as developing night markets and building a food city to boost tourism.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said a new government body aimed at developing tourist hotspots will hold its first meeting next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible," Yeung said.

    Adequate measures taken over monkey deaths: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the government has taken sufficient preventive measures at the Zoological and Botanical Gardens on news of the death of a tenth monkey there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria is unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7pm on Friday, local media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were no casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Myanmar military blamed "terrorists" for the explosion that damaged roof tiles on the two-storey consulate, adding that security forces were investigating in order to arrest anyone found responsible.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Mexican navy announced on Saturday it had seized more than 8.3 tonnes of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Navy personnel seized 8,361 kilogrammes of illicit cargo, which represents the largest amount of drugs seized in a maritime operation, unprecedented in history," said a statement from the Ministry of the Navy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It did not specify the type of the drugs, but said they were valued at 2.099 billion pesos (US$105 million).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-three people were arrested during the bust which took place southwest of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, off the western coast of Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drugs were distributed in six small boats and one of the vessels was a submersible, which implied a "complex" action on the part of the sailors, added the ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The largest drug seizure in Mexico's history was 23 tonnes of Colombian cocaine in November 2007.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has for decades been the hub of drug trafficking to the United States, with a large number of cartels fighting for control of the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The state of Michoacan, off the coast of which the seizure took place, is the scene of clashes between criminal gangs, including the powerful Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal groups. (AFP)

    Azores to create huge marine conservation area

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The regional assembly of Portugal's Azores Islands approved the creation of the largest protected marine area in the North Atlantic to reach international conservation goals well ahead of time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval places the archipelago at the forefront of global ocean conservation that aims to achieve the goals set by the United Nations of protecting 30 percent of the Earth's land and sea by 2030 under a global pact adopted last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network will encompass almost 300,000 square kilometres and ensure the preservation of underwater mountain ranges and vulnerable marine ecosystems, including deep-sea corals, hydrothermal vents and marine species.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have acted in advance of the international conservation goals for 2030 with the creation of the largest marine park in the North Atlantic, with fully protected areas and highly protected areas," Bernardo Brito e Abreu, adviser to the Azorean government on maritime affairs said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He explained that half of the network would be designated as a fully protected area, which means fishing activities are not allowed. In the other half, designated as a highly protected area, only very selective fishing will be allowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nine-island archipelago is an autonomous region roughly 1,500 km west of mainland Portugal and home to unique marine biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Azores government chief Jose Manuel Bolieiro said the region was leading by example at national, European and international levels in the management and protection of its waters and "making a significant contribution to Portugal meeting the international targets for the decade". (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory over Ineos Britannia on Saturday to defend the America's Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating their British opponents by 37 seconds in the ninth race off Barcelona to end the best-of-13 series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand raced into a 4-0 lead in the 37th edition of the competition before Britain fought back with two victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However the Kiwis responded with three points in a row to clinch a third straight victory after their successes in 2017 and 2021, the country's fifth triumph in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What an amazing feeling, it's been a tough battle all week, but an amazing scoreline and I'm proud of the way the team kept battling today," said Kiwi helmsman Peter Burling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's still just sinking in... what an awesome day, Barcelona's just been absolutely amazing, what an amazing feeling."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ninth race was delayed by 40 minutes because of light wind conditions but eventually began with Ineos knowing they needed to win five straight races to lift the trophy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British boat crossed the start line a knot faster than their opponents and the teams exchanged the lead until New Zealand pulled ahead by 200 metres at the first gate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kiwis extended their lead to 22 seconds by the second mark but Ineos continued to fight relentlessly and cut the gap to 69 metres at one point in the fourth leg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The right side of the course offered higher pressure and New Zealand did a good job of defending it, denying Britain a way back in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Skipper Ben Ainslie and Ineos, bankrolled by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, needed a miracle like the comeback from 8-1 down to win Oracle Team USA the America's Cup in 2013, but it was not forthcoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Britain have still never won the competition which started 173 years ago with a race around the Isle of Wight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team, and in my view they are the best team ever in the America's Cup," said Ainslie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day the better team won.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is not going to be the end of the journey for us, we set out 10 years ago to win the America's Cup, we're getting closer each time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The trick is to keep going and get it home the next time." (AFP)

    Low-altitude trials to include Cyberport, Science Park

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first phase of pilot projects on developing the low-altitude economy will focus on using drones for food delivery and transporting cargo with Cyberport and Science Park being in the pipeline, the government said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching "regulatory sandboxes" early next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the government's plan to reduce waste in Hong Kong remains unchanged despite the shelving of the waste charging scheme, adding that raising public awareness and increasing recycling facilities instead has achieved great results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government announced earlier this year that they would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme in August as originally planned, but the environment chief said at a press conference on Saturday that good recycling and waste management practice has increased immensely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said that they will optimise a plan and share their progress with the Legislative Council in the middle of next year.

    97% of HK's riverbank waste is plastic: Greenpeace

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenpeace on Saturday said more than 3,200 pieces of rubbish have been collected in its clean-up operations along two of Hong Kong's riverbanks in the past four months, with 97 percent of it being plastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top items found in the Lam Tsuen and Pui O Rivers were food and beverage packaging, disposable plastic tableware, and shipping materials, the environmental group told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said microplastics from these sources can enter ecosystems and food chains, potentially affecting human health.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It easily get into the ecosystem because they are small, maybe eaten by animals. Or even when we drink it or we eat through the food chain, they will enter our blood system or even our brain," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam said the government should implement a HK$1 deposit system for beverage bottles, rather than the proposed 10-cent incentive, to better tackle plastic waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government should add the reduction target on single-use packaging and also the reuse target for the overall package and overall beverage packaging system," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The advocate added that individuals and companies can also play a part by choosing packaging-free items and changing their business models to phase out single-use plastics.

    Record high Colombian cocaine production in 2023: UN

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine exporter, set a new record last year for production of the drug and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from, a United Nations report said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf cultivation was 10 percent higher last year than in 2022, while cocaine production rose 53 percent from 1,738 tonnes to 2,600, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were the highest numbers since the UN started monitoring in 2001. Most Colombian cocaine is destined for the United States and Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf production now spreads over 253,000 hectares (625,100 acres) in the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trend has been upward since 2014 despite a US-based war on drugs worth millions of US dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The areas of Colombia with the biggest increase in 2023 were the Cauca and Narino departments, both bastions of dissidents groups of the FARC guerrilla army that disbanded in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 percent of the total area under coca cultivation in Colombia is on land belonging to communities of African descent, 10 percent on Indigenous reserves and 18 percent in protected forest areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Colombian city of Cali will host the COP16 global summit on biodiversity for two weeks starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Colombia's first-ever leftist President Gustavo Petro has accused US anti-drug policies of causing a "genocide" of Latin Americans for focusing on "repression" rather than prevention and public health. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Friday night near Jabalia in the territory's north killed 33 people at a refugee camp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal announced "33 deaths and dozens of wounded" while a medical source at the Al-Awda hospital said earlier that it had registered 22 dead and 70 wounded after the strike on the Tal al-Zaatar camp for Palestinian refugees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked for comment about overnight strikes in the area, an Israeli army spokesperson said they were "looking into it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On October 6, Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza, including around Jabalia, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, scores of people have been killed in the area, which had already been hit hard by fighting earlier in the year-long war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN humanitarian affairs agency said on Friday night that it continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment." (AFP)

    Bus parade, exhibition mark PRC's 75th anniversary

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buses ranging from museum pieces to state-of-the-art machines on Saturday rolled through the city to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The parade, organised by the Transport Department and three franchised bus operators, featured retired and in-service buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procession started in Victoria Park, passing along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and finishing up at the Central Ferry Piers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is also a four-day bus exhibition underway at Victoria Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the departure ceremony, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said buses have long been an indispensable part of people's livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rapid development of new energy technologies of our country in recent years has enriched Hong Kong's choices of new energy public transport," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous electric double-decker buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses introduced into Hong Kong in the past few years were China-made models."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many bus lovers gathered to take photos of the parading buses, including Mr Lee, who purposely came from Guangzhou, to see some of the SAR's antique buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have never seen these discontinued buses in a public event parading before, so I think this opportunity is very rare. I purposely came from the mainland to see them," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator, Mr Chan, was ecstatic to see history passing through the streets of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't think they would host a bus tour. I saw some new buses. It turns out that one of them is a new Citybus that is probably not in service yet. I couldn't believe that new buses would be featured in the parade. It’s really exciting. I hope the government will organise more parades in the future."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Mets kept their magical season going, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-6 on Friday to stay alive in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pete Alonso hit a three-run home run in the first inning and the Mets piled up five runs in the third on the way to an 8-1 lead, then held on to cut the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers, who were hoping to close out the series at the Mets' Citi Field, instead will host game six on Sunday, again with a chance to return to the World Series for the first time since they won it all in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We'll be ready," Alonso vowed. "We love opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Andy Pages homered twice for the Dodgers, including a three-run blast that cut New York's lead to 10-5 in the fifth inning. Mookie Betts's solo homer in the sixth pulled the Dodgers within four, but the Mets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte belted three doubles, driving in three runs on four hits for New York. Francisco Lindor and Jesse Winker both plated runs with triples for the Mets, who had 14 hits with no strikeouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will take on either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, with a three-run homer from Giancarlo Stanton and a tie-breaking pair of runs in the top of the ninth, beat the Guardians 8-6 to take a 3-1 stranglehold on the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, with their backs against the wall, came out firing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They seized a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Alonso's towering home run to center field that also scored Lindor and Brandon Nimmo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pulled a run back with two out in the second when Enrique Hernandez raced home on a wild pitch from Mets hurler David Peterson to Shohei Ohtani.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Mets poured it on in the third when Marte made Dodgers starting pitcher Jack Flaherty pay for walking Alonso and Winker to open the frame, belting a double up the left field line that scored both.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty retired two batters before the Mets put together three straight run-scoring hits to make it 8-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Peterson surrendered a solo home run to Pages in the fourth as the Dodgers continued to press, but the Mets pushed their lead to 10-2 with a pair of runs in the bottom of the fourth and Los Angeles could never close the gap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Cleveland, Stanton crushed his fourth home run of this post-season to power the Yankees, hammering a three-run blast off Guardians relief pitcher Cade Smith to put them up 6-2 in the sixth inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smith had walked Juan Soto to open the inning. Yankees slugger Aaron Judge cranked a single before a sacrifice bunt from Jazz Chisholm brought up Stanton, who launched a fastball 404 feet into the left field seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, stunned by the Guardians' come-from-behind game three victory on Thursday, wasted no time, taking a 2-0 lead in the top of the first on Soto's two-run homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin Wells also homered for the Yankees, but the Guardians scored three runs in the seventh inning to pull within 6-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland tied it at 6-6 in the eighth when David Fry's soft infield hit was fielded clumsily by Yankees pitcher Mark Leiter, whose toss got past first baseman Anthony Rizzo to allow Fry to second as Bo Naylor – who opened the inning with a double – scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, trying to return to the World Series for the first time since winning their record 27th title in 2009, pushed across two runs in the top of the ninth against Cleveland's star closer Emmanuel Clase and held on for the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They can finish off the series with a victory in game five on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The key is to go play one more game – go out there and try to win that game," Soto said. "Forget about the series, just try to go out there and win the game ... that's all we need to do." (AFP)

    Skilled technicians to come and fill manpower shortage
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians to ease the manpower shortage, adding that they hope to attract younger workers to bring down the average working age in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, he said that Hong Kong is projected to face a shortage of approximately 180,000 workers across different sectors in the future, with about 60,000 vacancies earmarked for skilled technicians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that the remaining 50,000 spots would be reserved for locals who are interested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certain conditions for the people coming in. They must first have a licence, and secondly, they can only engage in their own industry when they come to Hong Kong. They cannot work in another field. This is the way to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to choose younger people because we hope that they can work for a long time, and we want to make the workforce younger. That is very important for our future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that labour importation schemes are short-term solutions, and that they would continue to train local workers to alleviate the problem in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stated in the new Policy Address, the government will build a campus for the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, under the Vocational Training Council, and develop its Lift and Escalator Technology Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said that both universities and the Vocational Training Council would also focus on the demand for high-tech talents, with institutions increasing incentives for research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "High technology plays a huge role in the development of our future, so whether it is in our universities, or through the Vocational Training Council, there will be courses catered to this type of demand. Even in our universities, we will add more scholarships for students to do some research and study for master's and doctoral degrees," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is mainly for the industries that we need. We will encourage them to do their best and provide them with more incentives to train and study in the future, and it's all towards high-tech development."

    New tourism working group to uncover hidden gems: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A new working group on developing tourist hotspots will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong and will ease the workload of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Chief Executive John Lee said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Lee said the working group, led by Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk, will strengthen cross departmental co-ordination and leverage community efforts in identifying and developing tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the CE said officials hope to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, the Champs-Élysées in France... it has many unique features, and everyone goes there. Hong Kong of course has its own attractions. We already have Victoria Harbour, which we'll continue to develop," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we also have many other treasures. How can we showcase our Geopark? We've discussed this before. There are many various aspects. We hope to pay more attention to public opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The policy blueprint also outlined plans to develop the SAR into an international tertiary education hub by creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to attract exchange students with the city's high cost of living, Lee said Hong Kong has much to offer with its freedom, convenience, and cultural diversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I like a girl because she's beautiful, sometimes because she's virtuous, and sometimes because of her knowledge. Hong Kong also appeals in many ways. Of course, we're not as big [geographically] as other big cities. That's the reality. But we still have many other appealing features," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On another radio programme, the CE was asked if he was dissatisfied that cultural and tourism officials failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said, "When you look at the 2023 Policy Address, around four to five items are behind schedule. When I set indicators, I look at whether there are reasons for the delay and if those reasons are justified. The purpose is to make sure that we accomplish what we have promised to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as, in the Policy Address annex, Lee pointed out the bureau "requires more time to revise the draft blueprint to cater for the long‑term development of the sector".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to queries about the matter on Friday, cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the blueprint is "nearly complete" and he didn't feel that the CE had publicly urged him in any way.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 chalked up record closing highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq also in positive territory, as markets were boosted by an earnings-driven jump in Netflix shares and broader gains across technology stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major Wall Street benchmarks also comfortably secured a sixth straight weekly gain, their longest weekly winning streaks since late 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.09 percent s to close at 43,277. The S&P gained 0.4 percent to end at 5,864, while the Nasdaq rose 0.63 percent, to 18,488.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Netflix jumped 11.1 percent to a record closing high after the streaming giant topped Wall Street estimates for subscriber additions and said it expected continued growth through the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have driven much of Wall Street's rally this year, rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apple gained 1.2 percent after data showed a sharp increase in new iPhone sales in China, while chip heavyweight Nvidia advanced 0.8 percent after BofA Global Research hiked its price target on the stock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netflix's increase lifted the communication services sector 0.9 percent, making it the largest gainer among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, while information technology rose 0.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's kind of the 'what's not to like' market," said David Waddell, chief executive of Waddell & Associates, citing positive economic data, disinflation and upbeat earnings and forecasts from corporate America. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba on Friday experienced a nationwide blackout after the island's main power plant failed, causing the country's electricity grid to collapse, the energy ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The system was left without power nationwide" after the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, Lazaro Guerra, director general of electricity at the ministry of energy and mines, told state television.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the thermoelectric plant shut down "the system collapsed," he said, adding the government was working to restore service as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced the island was in the throes of an "energy emergency," with severe supply shortages leaving some provinces without power for up to 20 hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government on Thursday suspended all non-essential public sector activities in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba gets its power from eight ageing thermal power plants, as well as seven floating plants leased from Turkish companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The island nation has been under a severe embargo by the United States since 1958. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An SUV driver who ran over a cyclist following an altercation in central Paris has been charged with murder after a court hearing, a source close to the case said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 52-year-old driver of the SUV is accused of having deliberately targeted the cyclist, 27, on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another judge will now rule whether he should be held in custody ahead of trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuesday's incident in Paris's wealthy 8th district comes as tensions rise in the battle for street space in the congested capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tense exchanges between cyclists and drivers are commonplace in the city centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The driver, whose teenage daughter was also in the car, was arrested on the spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the motorist and the cyclist were seen having an angry dispute by the side of the road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   French associations promoting cycling have condemned the incident, with "Paris en Selle" calling it "an unacceptable tragedy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, 226 cyclists died on French roads. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kyiv said on Friday it had received the bodies of 501 servicemen killed fighting Russian forces, mainly in eastern Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed military personnel remains one of the few areas of cooperation between Moscow and Kyiv since Russia attacked in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a result of repatriation measures, 501 bodies of fallen Ukrainian defenders were returned to Ukraine," the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement represents one of the largest repatriations of killed Ukrainian servicemen since the beginning of the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the remains were returned from the eastern Donetsk region, said the agency. Russian forces have been advancing steadily there since their capture of the industrial hub of Avdiivka in February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several state bodies had helped coordinate the return including the defence forces, the agency added, acknowledging the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Representatives of law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims," the coordination centre said in its statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a proper burial." (AFP)

    Rugby to trial 20-minute red cards in November Tests

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Referees will have the option of awarding 20-minute red cards for technical offences during the Autumn Nations Series, organisers announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sport's global governing body World Rugby trialled the change in the Rugby Championship earlier this year, allowing a team to replace a red-carded player after 20 minutes in the sin-bin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Importantly for the Autumn Tests, which pitch southern hemisphere teams against those from the north, match officials will also retain the ability to award a permanent red card for acts of foul play which are deemed deliberate and dangerous.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The red card variation ensures that players deemed to commit deliberate and dangerous offences receive the full sanctioning, and subsequent disciplinary process, with the team being reduced to 14 men for the remainder of the game," Six Nations Rugby said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Referees will have the option to award a 20-minute red card for technical offences. This variation on the law trial will run throughout the Autumn Nation Series and differs to the standalone 20-minute red card proposal due to be discussed by the wider game later this year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   National unions in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand back the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there are others who oppose it, notably France and Ireland. The latter country's union said on Friday it did "not support the permanent adoption of a 20-minute red card," as proposed by World Rugby.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Player welfare and safety are paramount to the core values of the game and the option of a permanent red card for deliberate and intentional acts of foul play supports those values and protects the integrity of the game," the Irish union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The IRFU welcomes the variation to World Rugby's closed law trial," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other law trials on show in November include kickers having just 60 seconds to complete a penalty or a conversion, the latter with a countdown starting straight after a try is scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If a player exceeds this time limit, the conversion kick will be disallowed, while for a penalty, a scrum is awarded to the non-kicking team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will also be a scrum and line-out clock, with the set-pieces to be formed within 30 seconds of the referee and assistant officials making the respective mark. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday confirmed its leader Yahya Sinwar had been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, a day after Israel announced his death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We mourn the great leader, the martyred brother, Yahya Sinwar, Abu Ibrahim," Qatar-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said in a recorded video statement broadcast by Al Jazeera.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinwar became Israel's most wanted man after the October 7, 2023 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement, Hayya said Hamas would not release the hostages it seized from Israel during the attack until the war in Gaza ends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hostages "will not return... unless the aggression against our people in Gaza stops," the senior Hamas official said, as he called on Israel to withdraw from Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hayya said the militant group would take strength from Sinwar's killing, which he said has set him among "the leaders and symbols of the movement who preceded him." (AFP)

    Melioidosis to blame for monkey deaths: officials

  <img alt="Officials say there is no need to shut down the whole zoo, as the melioidosis-causing bacteria do not easily transmit from animals to humans. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775197_2_20241018200137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nine monkeys from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, authorities revealed on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Part of the zoo has been shut down since Monday after eight monkeys, including three critically-endangered cotton-top tamarins, were found dead the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One more death was registered later, while another monkey was taken away for observation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Subsequent autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung offered a possible explanation of where the bacteria came from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said works performed at the zoo earlier this month required the digging up of soil near the monkeys' habitat. Workers were then believed to have brought contaminated soil into the cage through their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Centre for Health Protection, the bacterium is particularly common in moist clay soil. It can affect both humans and animals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yeung stressed that it is not necessary to seal off the whole facility from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have taken all the cleansing and disinfection measures on the cages. With all these measures, we believe that it's now clean and free of the bacteria," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also cordoned off the whole mammals section for the time being, so there will be no sort of contact between normal citizens with the animals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Protective gear has been provided to staff after the incident, and those who may have had contact with the monkeys tested negative for the bacterium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas Sit, assistant director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, said operators had performed check-ups for the animals as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the animals lost appetite, they were a bit incompetent, quiet, abnormal, and the time of onset of all the clinical signs only took two days, and then there was a sudden death of the animals," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The vets already took measures to treat the monkeys. However, the affected monkeys could not make it and [we] had to perform post-mortem and isolate [them] to prevent the spread of the disease."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sit said the facility has been instructed to step up cleansing work, and staff should maintain good hygiene to avoid a repeat of the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An infectious disease expert said the bacteria usually lie deep down in the soil, meaning contact with humans and animals was unlikely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there had been work done to this soil with digging, and also if these bacteria in the deep soil had been elevated to the surface, then the animals there could have been exposed to a large number of bacteria, so that would probably have contributed to this outbreak in these monkeys," Wilson Lam told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would be prudent to shut down the area temporarily, the doctor said, as the bacteria may still be present in the environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he played down fears of humans contracting the disease from monkeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Transmission from animals to human is really, really rare, so we are more worried about the presence of bacteria in the soil, and also the environment in the park at this moment."

    Kai Tak Sports Park to host test events this month

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Friday said there will be various test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park starting as early as the end of this month, to check transport facilities and crowd dispersal measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With mega events such as Coldplay concerts lined up for the sports park when it opens in the first quarter of next year, there have been calls for officials to improve transport solutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung told a press conference that such efforts are underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We may start with some small-scale games. For example, we have a smaller sports ground at Kai Tak with 5,000 seats. Some competitions will start to be held there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course during these so-called test events, we will try out the venue and its supporting facilities, and also things like crowd dispersal to see how we can do it best."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about a review of the redevelopment plan for Hong Kong Stadium – a move mentioned in this week's Policy Address – Yeung said officials need to examine how it can keep up with the city's development needs, and whether there are sufficient venues for mega events even after the Kai Tak site opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Policy Address annex, Chief Executive John Lee pointed out that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to questions about the matter, Yeung said the blueprint is nearly complete and he will follow the CE's instructions to finish it as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think the chief executive has publicly urged me to do anything... I think everyone needs to be pragmatic. When the CE mentioned me yesterday, it was in response to questions about tourism work. He used tourism as an example. I was there yesterday too. He talked about the division of work between the relevant working groups and the bureau. I don't feel there was any urging there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blueprint, expected to be promulgated later this year, will outline the vision and initiatives for developing high-quality arts, cultural and creative industries.

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

   British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Beijing on an official two-day visit, with the UK's new Labour government seeking to demonstrate its willingness to engage in a pragmatic and strategic approach to ties with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit is only the second by a British foreign secretary in six years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the two sides would focus on implementing the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries during the phone talks in August, and have in-depth communication on enhancing strategic mutual trust and strengthening dialogue and cooperation in various fields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit includes a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday before visiting Shanghai to meet British businesses operating in China. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Kim Jong-un declares South Korea a hostile nation

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said South Korea is a foreign and hostile nation, state media KCNA reported on Friday, with photos showing Kim conferring with high-ranking soldiers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim discussed the use of "offensive forces" against the South as retaliation for any move that infringes on its sovereignty, the report said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no elaboration on what forces might be used.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report comes a day after KCNA said North Korea amended its constitution to designate the South as a "hostile state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim has increasingly lashed out at South Korea this year, accusing Seoul of colluding with Washington to seek the collapse of his regime and has pushed for a clear break with decades of policy engagement with the South, including the scrapping of unification as a goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reclusive state blasted road and rail links with South Korea this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those actions underscored "not only the physical closure but also the end of the evil relationship with Seoul," KCNA quoted Kim as saying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has said that if North Korea were to inflict harm upon the safety of its people, "that day will be the end of the North Korean regime."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim made the remarks while inspecting the headquarters of the 2nd Corps of the North Korean army on Thursday, KCNA said, a major military unit that includes several forward-deployed brigades with heavy weapons aimed at the South.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the visit, he also said the changed nature of the South Korea-US alliance and their different, more developed military manoeuvres, highlight the importance of a stronger North Korean nuclear deterrent. (Reuters)

    HKMA rolls out measures to support SMEs
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday rolled out new capital rules and various support measures aimed at assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including HK$370 billion in dedicated funds offered by banks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures include allowing banks to apply more favourable capital requirements for larger enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new regulation, which is set to take effect in January next year, will cover businesses with annual turnover of up to HK$500 million – an increase from the previous cap of HK$100 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Countercyclical Capital Buffer has also been reduced from 1 percent to 0.5 percent with immediate effect, allowing banks to lend more freely and reducing their loan costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The authority added that 16 banks participating in the Taskforce on SME Lending have set aside a total of over HK$370 billion in dedicated funds for SMEs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “About that HK$370 billion dedicated funds for SMEs, that is actually more about a commitment by those banks involved in making sure that the supply of the credit will be there, but of course subject to prudent risk management,” said HKMA executive director Carmen Chu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A deputy chief executive at the authority, Arthur Yuen, said the dedicated funds are not a static figure and can be adjusted based on market conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will continue to discuss with the banks through the taskforce whether there's any room for further enhancing or increasing that number,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen said the taskforce, established in August, has received over 100 enquiries so far, with almost half requiring no intervention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But the taskforce did look into the remaining 60 percent of the cases and in some of the cases it involves communications between banks and customers. Some involve the processing time. Some involve the request for documents”, Yuen said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some also relate to how banks actually interact with customers when they are processing the application, whether they can smoothen some of the requests for information, et cetera. So the taskforce has been involved in sorting out some of those procedural sort of enhancements,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen also said the relaunch of the principal moratorium scheme, announced in this year’s Policy Address, will provide “important breathing space” for SMEs to transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SMEs are entitled to the moratorium if they borrow money through the government-backed SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We talked about digital transformation and green transformation, but for SMEs to go through digital transformation and green transformation, they need time, they need continuous support from the banking industry. So having the SFGS principal moratorium re-introduced is an important breathing space for that sort of transformation process to start,” Yuen said.

    'Spirits tax cut won't burden public health system'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits is not intended to encourage consumption and won't create an extra burden on the public health system, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent on the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite concerns that the move will lead to increased alcohol consumption, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said the right balance has been struck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe that a two-tier system can balance various considerations and create a more balanced measure. It reduces concerns from the medical community regarding alcohol abuse, while on the other hand aiming to boost trade in high-end spirits," he told a radio show.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   on his Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the the government is very conscious about protecting public health, but is at the same time creating extra opportunities for Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I do see the potential here, not just because of what we learn from the cancellation of wine duty, but in fact there is a big market for high-end liquor such as whiskey, and also brandy, and also a lot of Chinese liquor," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau also said Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau backed the duty cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also consulted Secretary Lo. This measure has his approval and support, which is why we are able to implement it," Yau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also speaking on an RTHK programme, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the duty cut won't have a huge effect on prices, noting that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mookie Betts homered and finished with four hits and four RBIs for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who took control of the National League Championship Series with a 10-2 win over the New York Mets in Game 4 on Thursday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers lead the best-of-seven series 3-1 and will attempt to clinch the pennant and a trip to the World Series on Friday afternoon, when the teams are scheduled to play Game 5 in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, who will be playing an elimination game for the second time this month, have been outscored 30-9 in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani homered on the second pitch of the game and walked in each of his next three plate appearances – all of which led to rally-extending hits by Betts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former American League MVP singled and later scored the final run of a two-run third-inning rally before lacing a two-run double in the fourth to extend the Dodgers' lead to 5-2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts added insurance in the sixth, when he greeted Phil Maton with a homer to left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tommy Edman put the Dodgers ahead for good with a two-out RBI double in the third. Enrique Hernandez followed with a run-scoring single. Edman had a two-run double in the eighth, when Will Smith added an RBI single.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Max Muncy, who started at first base with Freddie Freeman out due to a sore right ankle, walked in his first three plate appearances before singling in the seventh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the 12th straight plate appearance in which he had reached base, tying Reggie Jackson's postseason record. Muncy struck out in the eighth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Evan Phillips, the second of four Dodgers pitchers, earned the win by tossing 1 1/3 scoreless innings. He relieved starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who gave up two runs on four hits and one walk while striking out eight over 4 2/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mark Vientos homered in the first inning and Brandon Nimmo legged out the back end of a potential double-play grounder in the third inning for the Mets, who finished 4-for-22 with runners on base and left the bases loaded twice. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Travel Industry Council chair Gianna Hsu says the tourism industry has to up their game to attract more high-end travellers. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775125_2_20241018124511.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The tourism industry is eagerly seeking ways to attract more tourists from the Middle East and Asean countries, according to Travel Industry Council chairman Gianna Hsu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu said on Friday these tourists only account for a small percentage of all the city's tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, she also hoped that the expansion of multiple-entry visas would not just be limited to Guangdong province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The visa for Shenzhen residents, they can come to the city at any time and this would definitely increase manflow and consumption in the city. We also see the possibility for weekly visas. We hope it would not only be granted to Guangdong province, but also to cities that are further away, which require tourists to fly to Hong Kong, so they will have to stay here for two to three nights. This would help the industry to boost the economy," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Hong Kong has a lot of tourist spots and facilities to offer, but industry workers would have to do more to attract high-end tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, equestrian tourism has been around for years. The Jockey Club could consider improving the experience brought to tourists, such as adding photo-taking spots so tourists can take a picture with the horses if they won, or allow them to enter the paddock, or to see the horses at a closer distance," Hsu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Hsu said the reduction in the liquor tax, which was announced in the Policy Address, would not necessarily translate into increased visitor numbers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When tourists come to the city, they drink wine with their meals or during evening activities. Liquor prices might be more competitive now and it may attract tourists to have a drink because the prices are more attractive, but I don't think more tourists will come here just because there's a tax reduction," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hsu added that with the stabilisation of the tourism industry in recent years, those who left the sector previously would return gradually, and the industry was also seeking new talent to join by strengthening communication with hospitality schools.

   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said innovation and technology is the way forward for Hong Kong to remain competitive and prosperous.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   on his latest Policy Address, Lee said the good research being carried out needs to be turned into marketable products that can help society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the territory has attracted a lot of I&T talent to grow the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have created platforms for people to gather together and so far, we've got two platforms, which we call InnoHK. [They] have gathered altogether 2,500 very top leading researchers from different parts of the world. They gather both physically in Hong Kong and also online," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is some of the things that we do. We want to set up more laboratories so that there will be more possible projects to be transformable and then we want more money to be put into research."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government cannot be the only source of investment in the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're still only investing about 1.07 percent of the whole GDP of Hong Kong, but for many successful countries, you have to at least have 5 percent to talk about a level that will ensure that we can really go ahead. So we are working very hard," he said.

    'Enhanced capital scheme to attract more talent to HK'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said he was confident that improvements to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme would attract more talent to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his policy blueprint, the chief executive announced that successful applicants to the cash-for-residency scheme are now permitted to invest in residential property worth at least HK$50 million, with up to HK$10 million counting towards the total capital investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Previously, residential property investments were not allowed under the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK programme, Chan said this change aims to lure high-net-worth individuals while still protecting the local housing market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our policy goal is not to prop up the property market for units worth more than HK$50 million. That's not my objective. My aim is this: when people come to Hong Kong and want to invest in property, they can. However, we don't want this to disrupt our local residential market," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also said he hopes the government's move to ease mortgage lending restrictions would foster a more stable and positive market outlook for the property market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Policy Address outlined that the maximum loan-to-value ratio for homes would be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio would be raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The property market is becoming more stable. Recent transaction volumes have been lower than before, which we see as a positive sign of orderly adjustment," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope that after the property market returns to normal in this way, everyone will have more positive expectations for its future development."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan stressed that property prices and transaction volumes were influenced by many factors, including economic conditions, the stock market, and the external environment.

    Abundant land supply helps keep prices in check: CE
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said Hong Kong has enough land alloted for housing that should prevent any acute shortages over the next few decades, and also help keep prices in check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was responding to a caller on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   asking whether the government’s reserve prices for land sales effectively keeps prices largely unaffordable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee stressed that land is a precious asset that belongs to the people and should be valued accordingly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that he had in his Policy Address this week introduced measures to help prospective homebuyers by increasing how much they can borrow from banks for mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While noting that there is “still more” the government needs to do, he stressed that the government has accelerated its pace in securing land for housing, and the 7,000 hectares of land now available for residential use over the next three decades means there shouldn’t be any shortage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If there's more land supply, then the price of land will be suitably set according to [the actual] market situation. The big shortage that appeared previously should not happen that abruptly now,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive also said developers will have to keep prices tethered to reality as everyone knows there’s adequate supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Everybody knows how much land and when it will be available, and the price set by the developers will have to be in accordance with the actual situation and then all the calculations can be done by even the normal citizen,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also played down the possibility that new proposed restrictions on subdivided flats could create a shortage and drive prices up, as the government is set to propose new legislation requiring all flats to be at least 86 square feet in size, have windows and an individual toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there are clear financial incentives for people to supply small, affordable units for rent, as research shows they would earn several times more from renting out subdivided units compared to one single apartment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There is a strong business case for the market to develop,” he said. “Once the rules are clear, then I think it’s only natural for those who have been benefiting or who see this as a beneficial business will then develop it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said there should be ample time for this new supply to emerge, since the entire process of legislation and registration, along with a grace period, means the new rules would only fully be in place in “a few years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the market will ensure that the right rent is set,” Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE also repeated his call for various business sectors here to reform and evolve to  adapt to the changing conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The economy isn't doing badly because we are still strongly in the belief that the overall economy will grow between 2.5 to 3.5 percent,” he said. “That means the macro economy is positive, but micro-economy, particularly for some sectors, they may have to think of new ways of doing things as to make themselves attractive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the Chief Executive spent most of the hour-long phone-in programme explaining his new policies, he got some new ideas from callers as well, including from Jeffrey – who asked John Lee if he could do anything to pave the way for motorcyclists to ride their bikes directly across the border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The questioned appeared to stir up the CE’s passion as a car enthusiast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Obviously, I enjoy driving as well,” Lee responded. “So I do look forward to the time when I do retire, then I will personally drive to different parts of the world, in particularly the GBA and other mainland cities.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So I do understand why you want to have your own bike and drive up to the mainland – it's easy and also China being a big country you really have a lot to see, really a lot to enjoy. I can't make my promise but definitely you have made a new point which I find attractive”, he said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cleveland's David Fry smashed the game-winning home run in the 10th inning on Thursday to give the Guardians a dramatic 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Thursday in the Major League Baseball playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians, one out from defeat, made a stunning fightback to pull within 2-1 of the Yankees in the in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, which continues Friday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When everybody thinks we can't do it, we think we can," Fry said. "What a win. That was so good – it was fun."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ALCS winner will play in the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers, who meet later Thursday in game four of the National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning and New York added an insurance run in the ninth for a 5-3 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But in the bottom of the ninth with the hosts down to their final out, Cleveland pinch-hitter Jhonkensy Noel smashed a two-run homer into the left-field stands, the Dominican rookie lifting the Guardians level 5-5 to force extra innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York stranded two base runners in the top of the 10th, setting the stage for Cleveland's walk-off win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bo Naylor singled and took second base on Brayan Rocchio's sacrifice bunt before Fry smashed the game-winning homer off Yankees relief pitcher Clay Holmes over the left-field wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not many times do I know the ball has left here to left field, but I had a really good feeling," Fry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Amazing. I still don't know what happened but it ended up we won," he added. "It's so awesome, it's surreal. We've got a lot more to do, though, but it was fun tonight."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to recover from the near-miss for game four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They scratched and clawed their way back in," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Sucks losing like that, but we'll be ready to roll tomorrow."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not reached the World Series since winning their record 27th title in 2009 while Cleveland , which last reached the World Series in 2016, has not captured the crown since 1948. (AFP)

    'HK en route to becoming international education hub'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said it is important to promote Hong Kong's brand as a good education hub around the world to encourage more people to study in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK
   <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/ce_phonein " style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">
    phone-in programme
   </a>
   on Friday, he said the territory was working on becoming a global education hub, with five of its universities in the top 100.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it was important to maintain a strong educational standard among all institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will introduce the law to ensure that the standard is set, to ensure the Hong Kong education standard is a standard that has been as good as always has been, so to attract more people to join the education sector and allow more students to come to satisfy their individual needs," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The whole game plan is to ensure that we grow in different areas, be attractive to students around the world, to satisfy different aspirations of students in different parts of the world, particularly Belt and Road countries."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said that additional support centres for ethnic minorities groups have been set up in different districts, to provide interpretation and translation services to reduce language barrier concerns for those looking for a job in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that reform has been made to the Employees Retraining Board to ensure that people are equipped with the right skills and training for employment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Instead of just training people for jobs, then we have now think that it's more appropriate to design courses to train people with skills. When we talk about skills, we need to know what kind of skills are required for employees to get good jobs in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Rather than trying to learn to chase for jobs, we increase the potential and abilities for every employee, so that they have skills and they can pick the jobs."

    China's economy grows 4.6 percent in third quarter

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's economy grew by 4.6 percent in the third quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous three-month period, while consumption and factory output figures beat forecasts last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a post-data press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, underpinned by further policy support and another cut to the amount banks must hold in reserve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Based on our comprehensive assessment, the economy in the fourth quarter is expected to continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September. We are fully confident in achieving the full-year target," Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The NBS also said in a statement that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first three quarters, China's factory output rose 5.8 percent, while retail sales expanded 3.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, property investment sank 10.1 percent and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the release of the new data, state media said China’s top banks had cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year as part of a move to boost lending.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland policymakers have in recent weeks unveiled a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank on Friday launched one such measure – a swap facility for funds and insurers with an "initial application quota exceeding 200 billion yuan", state media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will provide greater liquidity for capital markets, which policymakers hope will offer support for the wider economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a possible sign of more relief to come, PBoC chief Pan Gongsheng said on Friday that officials were considering a further cut to the amount commercial lenders must hold in reserve before the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, China's finance minister pledged to "significantly increase" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's top banks on Friday cut interest rates on deposits in yuan for the second time this year, state media said, as Beijing seeks to boost sluggish consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed in mixed territory on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite once more buoyed by renewed interest in chipmakers and designers like Nvidia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent to end at a new record of 43,239.05, while the S&P 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to close at 5,841.47.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose less than 0.1 percent to close at 18,373.61, as chip design titan Nvidia saw its share price rise 0.9 percent on the back of a 9.8 percent rise in chipmaker TSMC's shares on strong third quarter results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders were also digesting fresh data published on Thursday showing an acceleration in retail sales last month, and another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mill Street Research chief strategist Sam Burns told AFP that the positive economic news in the US, and rate cut in Europe, had helped stocks to return to near all-time highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Earnings reports so far have been pretty good and there doesn't seem to be too much concern, at least so far, about the election and things like that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among other firms, streaming giant Netflix's shares rose in after-hours trading after it announced it had topped earnings expectations in the third quarter. (AFP)

    Alcaraz defeats Nadal in Six Kings semi-finals

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal admitted his fitness level was well off the tour's top players after falling Thursday in straight sets to fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who described the exhibition match as "a little bit sad".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Nadal, who announced last week he would retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month, lost 6-3, 6-3 to 21-year-old Alcaraz in the semi-finals of the "Six Kings Slam" event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afterwards he described Alcaraz, winner of the French Open and Wimbledon this year, as an "animal" and acknowledged he was not competing at the highest level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have not much pressure here. I'm just trying to have fun," he told a post-match press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know I'm going to play against players that – are in much better shape than me because they are on the professional tour and winning tournaments."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz said he knew the Saudi crowd was against him but wanted to let Nadal, winner of 22 Grand Slams including 14 French Open titles, bask in the support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a little bit sad – it was not a really comfortable moment for me. Obviously I really wanted to win," said Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once you step on the court it's no friends, no idols" but "I think this is his moment right now," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to Thursday's match Nadal had made his last singles appearance at the Olympic Games in Paris where his campaign was cut short by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had also teamed-up with Alcaraz in men's doubles at the Games and may reprise that role at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal will play Djokovic again on Saturday after the Serbian great lost a much tighter match to Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner, who prevailed 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 and will take on Alcaraz in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having Novak in front, it's like a nostalgic thing," Nadal said, looking ahead to their battle for third place in the Saudi exhibition. "We faced each other plenty of times, so it's going to be good fun to play each other again one more time in this match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for the Davis Cup Finals next month, Nadal said he was unclear what his form would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Emotionally I'm sure I will be ready. In terms of physically, in terms of tennis level – there's still a month to prepare," he said, adding that he would not hesitate to speak up if he thought he could not compete well in singles. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Skipper Rohit Sharma on Thursday said he was "hurting" after opting to bat first on a seaming pitch as hosts India fell to a dismal 46 all out against New Zealand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kiwi fast bowlers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke wreaked havoc in overcast conditions to dismiss India in 31.2 overs on the first Test's second afternoon in Bengaluru.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was India's third-lowest Test score ever and lowest at home, worse than their 75 against the West Indies in New Delhi in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their lowest overall is 36 against Australia in a pink-ball Adelaide Test in 2020. They fell for 42 against England at Lord's in 1974.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We felt there was not much grass on the pitch and it will do whatever it has to do in the first couple of sessions and then it is going to take a turn as the game goes on," Rohit told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expected the wicket to be flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly misjudgement of the pitch," he added. "Obviously, I didn't read the pitch enough and we sit in that situation today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five Indian batsmen including Virat Kohli got out for a duck as Henry and O'Rourke shared nine wickets between them in a rare show of domination by opposition bowlers in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am hurting a little bit because I made that call," said Rohit. "But we want to challenge ourselves. This time it didn't come off, the challenge that was thrown at us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former captain Tim Southee drew first blood as he bowled Rohit through the gate. Fellow quick O'Rourke silenced the crowd when he sent back Kohli for nought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry wrapped up the innings with a five-wicket haul and his last strike of Kuldeep Yadav was his 100th Test wicket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a good toss to lose," said Henry. "It was quite nice when those clouds started coming in. I think we were expecting it to be a flatter wicket but there was plenty of assistance this morning – it was great that we could make the most of it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have the upper hand with a lead of 134 as they ended the day on 180-3 after Devon Conway's 91. Henry warned his team against letting their guard down.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can't be complacent at all," he said. "We've just got to keep mounting pressure." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A superb 74 not out from Anneke Bosch fired South Africa into the Women's T20 World Cup final as they demolished defending champions Australia by eight wickets in Dubai on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Set 135 to win, South Africa reached their target with 16 balls to spare, with Bosch, who struck eight fours and a six in her 48-ball innings, sharing a match-winning partnership of 96 with skipper Laura Wolvaardt (42).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Sunday's final, which will be the first not to feature one of Australia or England, the South Africans will face either West Indies or New Zealand who meet in the second semi-final on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia, who have won six of the previous eight editions, had been the odds-on favourites to win a seventh title in the United Arab Emirates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they had no answer to South Africa for whom this marked a measure of revenge for defeat by Australia in last year's final in Cape Town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think this is one of the best wins of my cricketing career for sure. A couple of other girls have said it as well," said Wolvaardt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that was such an amazing chase," she added. "The bowlers are excellent. It's been a good year for us – I think it's been a real collective group effort." (AFP)

    Formula One to drop fastest lap bonus point

  <img alt="The FIA made the announcement ahead of the United States Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775074_1_20241018081351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Formula One is scrapping from next year the award of a bonus point for fastest lap in a race, introduced with much fanfare just five years ago, governing body the FIA said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bonus point was awarded originally in the 1950s, but then dropped before being reintroduced in 2019 for the lap, if the driver finishes in the top ten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has potential significance in a long season of 24 races, as this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FIA (International Motoring Federation) made the announcement ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix among changes to the 2024 and 2025 sporting and technical regulations after approval by the World Motor Sport Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another change, a requirement to run a young driver during free practice is to increase from once per car per season to twice per car per season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The significance of the fastest lap was shown at last month's Singapore Grand Prix where RB's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo pitted for new tyres to set the fastest lap in his final race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RB are a sister team to Red Bull and thereby deprived rivals like McLaren and their title-challenging driver Lando Norris of a possible additional point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris held the fastest lap and bonus point as the race entered its final laps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ricciardo was 18th and not eligible to score a bonus point, but he was called to pit and duly set the lap, depriving Norris of a point. (AFP)

    Biden heads to Germany to discuss Middle East

  <img alt="US President Joe Biden gets ready to board Air Force One in Maryland. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775044_1_20241017214236.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US President Joe Biden took off  onThursday on a swift farewell trip to Germany, for talks with allies to shore up Ukraine's increasingly desperate fight against Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also expected to discuss the escalating crisis in the Middle East, as Israel said it was investigating whether Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar had been killed in a military operation in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a flying 24-hour visit to Berlin, the US leader will meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, before they are both joined for talks by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was originally due in Germany last week for a multi-day visit that would have included a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a major summit of Kyiv's allies, but he postponed it as Hurricane Milton barrelled towards Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The White House said the shorter, rescheduled visit to the key Nato ally would "further strengthen the close bond the United States and Germany share as allies and friends and coordinate on geopolitical priorities, including Ukraine's defence against Russian aggression and events in the Middle East."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden was also keen to make the visit to thank Scholz for facilitating a prisoner exchange deal with Russia earlier this year that freed US reporter Evan Gershkovich, US officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the focus will be on Ukraine, with Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 White House race in July, keen to consolidate Western military aid for Kyiv in his final three months in office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allies are nervously watching the November 5 US presidential election to see if it brings a return of Donald Trump, who has opposed the current level of US support for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump has also repeatedly pledged to push through a peace deal if elected -- even before taking office -- that Kyiv fears would involve it giving up chunks of land to Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky told allies in Brussels on Thursday that Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kyiv is slowly but steadily losing territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Biden announced a fresh US$425 million arms package including air defense and armored vehicles for Ukraine in a call with Zelensky on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States is by far the biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine's battle against the 2022 Russian invasion, followed by Germany. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales in the United States accelerated in September, according to government data released on Thursday, even as auto and gas station sales remained tepid for the month -- a positive sign as the election approaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Overall sales rose 0.4 percent to US$714.4 billion between August and September, according to Commerce Department data, beating analysts' expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, sales edged up just 0.1 percent to US$711.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Excluding auto and gas station sales, the overall monthly rise would have been even higher at 0.7 percent in September, the report added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the US central bank had kept interest rates high for a large part of the year -- raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to tamp down inflation -- consumer spending has been more robust than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Households have been drawing down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period, and the economy could be given a further boost with the Federal Reserve starting to lower rates more recently.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Compared with the same month a year ago, retail sales were up 1.7 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon Macroeconomics noted in a recent report that "with growth in labour income slowing, credit conditions remaining tight and households recently having exhausted their excess savings, we expect growth to slow sharply over the next couple of quarters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon analysts added that "Hurricane Helene probably landed too late in the month" to have an impact on the sales figures, "and was too localized to have a major impact on national sales." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Israeli military on Thursday announced the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by its forces in southern Gaza the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military "confirms that after a year-long pursuit, yesterday (Wednesday), October 16, 2024, IDF (military) soldiers from the Southern Command eliminated Yahya Sinwar, the leader of the Hamas terrorist organisation, in an operation in the southern Gaza Strip," it said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The dozens of operations carried out by the IDF and the ISA (Shin Bet internal security agency) over the last year and in recent weeks in the area where he was eliminated restricted Yahya Sinwar's operational movement as he was pursued by the forces and led to his elimination," the military added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "IDF soldiers of the 828th Brigade (Bislach) operating in the area identified and eliminated three terrorists. The process of identifying the body confirms the elimination of Yahya Sinwar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel accuses Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered the ongoing war, along with Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli military has said Deif was killed in a strike earlier this year, though the Palestinian group has not confirmed it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, Sinwar took over as the leader of Hamas, following the death of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran on July 31. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hamas attack last year resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli soil, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures that include hostages killed in captivity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed 42,438 people, a majority of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN acknowledges the figures reliability. (AFP)

    Zelensky defends 'victory plan' at EU and NATO

  <img alt="Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of the European Council Charles Michel attend a European Union summit in Brussels. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775017_1_20241017183143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday said Ukraine must be in a position of strength before any peace talks with Russia, as he explained his "victory plan" to EU leaders and NATO defence chiefs in Brussels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than two and a half years into the war, Kiev is slowly but steadily losing new territory in its eastern Donbas region and under mounting pressure to forge an exit strategy -- which it says must start with ramped-up Western support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ukraine is ready for real diplomacy, but for it, we must be strong," Zelensky said as he headed into talks with the EU's 27 leaders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A forcefully imposed truce instead of fair peace never provided security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia will resort to diplomacy only when it sees that it cannot achieve anything by force," Zelensky added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is the plan. This is exactly what's needed, and we must create the right conditions to end this war."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the EU summit Zelensky was to join defence ministers for the first of two days of talks between NATO's 32 member states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While calling it a "strong signal," NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte cautioned ahead of time he was not endorsing Zelensky's "whole plan" -- which calls first and foremost for an immediate invitation to join the alliance, a plea widely seen as unrealistic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zelensky's plan also rejects any territorial concessions, calls for Western allies to lift restrictions on using donated long-range weapons to target Russian military sites, and suggests deploying a "non-nuclear strategic deterrence package" on Ukrainian territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian leader has travelled in recent weeks to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Rome and London to defend his plan -- unveiled to Ukrainian lawmakers Wednesday -- but it has yet to earn backing from Western capitals. (AFP)

    'People who lose subdivided flats will be rehoused'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday said it is confident that its plan to get rid of poor quality subdivided flats will not leave residents homeless and there'll be plenty of public housing available for them.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said a registration system will be introduced, and subdivided units will have to be at least eight square metres in size, with a window and separate toilet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a media briefing on Thursday, officials added that other requirements will include that rooms have a height of at least 2.3 metres, that the window opens into an area that isn't enclosed on all sides, and that the toilet has a ventilation system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The units must also comply with fire safety regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 30 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units are expected to fall foul of the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 12-18 month registration period is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of next year, with owners given a grace period of up to two years following registration to comply with the new rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said there's an abundant supply of public housing for residents of flats that don't make the grade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We've looked at the current composition of the residents of subdivided units. About 60 percent will be eligible for public housing. So the key is to provide an adequate quantity of public housing units, and that's something, I will say, where we are succeeding,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For the coming five years, even if we do not count the number of light public housing, we're able to provide more than 30,000 public housing units every year.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said tenants affected could also move into transitional housing or subdivided flats that do meet the minimum standards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Permanent Secretary for Housing Rosanna Law said rewards of about HK$3,000 will be offered to people who provide tip-offs about public housing tenancy abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move will be part of the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" to be launched by the Housing Authority in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Law said people will only get a reward once a recovery notice for a flat is issued, saying the authorities are setting conditions to deter indiscriminate reporting.

  <img alt="The three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving CSSA to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated homes in Guangdong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775010_1_20241017181134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A professor in geriatric medicine said the new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in special homes in Guangdong would be attractive to those who are relatively healthy and fit, but she said the option is not ideal for those who cannot care for themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jean Woo, from the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine, made the comment after Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address on Wednesday that the three-year pilot programme would allow up to 1,000 elderly people, who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She told RTHK that it may be very difficult for the elderly with serious illnesses or disabilities to cope with a new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What happens as you get older and older, nobody really knows, because we don't know what the healthcare support is like. If you have various chronic diseases, how easy is it to access primary care, follow-up, and so on," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Healthcare vouchers could be used on the mainland and certainly in some of the hospitals there, so I think that's a great help. So when you start to decline with your brain not working too well and physically you're not moving so well, what would be the situation? What about your social network, your family? There are a lot of unknowns," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I suspect the plan is not to move this group, but to have an option for people who are now living in the community, but wanted to be in an environment where they don't want to cook or do housework, or they want some social activities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, she said the quality and services in local residential care homes (RCHs) would go up, after the chief executive said there would be additional manpower support through the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we need to do something further upstream to slow down the decline into dependency by having initiatives in the community. But as I said, it's better than nothing," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a good direction to go because we are very short of people, the training and so on. But I think the salary needs to perhaps go up a bit more to attract people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of the government's plan to step up support for caregivers by extending their current service of sending community care teams to households in need to other parts of the city, Woo said care teams are great for the elderly because they are equipped with the right training.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From a geriatrician's point of view, we're used to screening multiple domains and we've been doing this using an automatic format and we have created an app so that we can train people in terms of what to look out [for], and watch out for things," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's a lot we can do before we even get to the doctors and the nurses, and the medications."

    LME looking into listing HK as a delivery point: govt

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Thursday said the London Metal Exchange (LME) is looking into listing Hong Kong as a delivery point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui told reporters that the LME had earlier expressed a desire to set up a warehouse in the city, and it is exploring practical ways to do so.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now the process is on their side, in terms of assessing the legal environment here, in terms of whether and how it can meet the criteria to be admitted as a delivery point by LME. I think that's the first step they need to take, before other warehouse companies can choose to locate their warehouses here," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in discussion with them, at the same time through our InvestHK, to facilitate any information and any assistance that they need from the government."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked if a site has been chosen, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said existing warehouses could be used if suitable, and it is not essential to build new facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, is a centre for the trading of industrial metals, with the majority of non-ferrous metal futures business transacted on its platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee said the government will capitalise on opportunities to establish supporting facilities for the storage and delivery of commodities.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said the government had taken into consideration factors like property prices, the supply of housing and the city's economy, before it reduced the down payment needed to buy a flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As announced in the chief executive's Policy Address yesterday, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for residential properties would be adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said property prices had come down and there would be sufficient housing supply, with over 108,000 first-hand units available in the next three to four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should let the market forces play. We should not unduly impose measures to suppress the demand, or try to prioritise different demands. Also, taking into consideration, at the moment, our banking sector is very healthy, very well-capitalised.
