<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka powered her way to the Miami Open title on Saturday, beating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event at Hard Rock Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami and her second of the season following her January triumph in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost the final at Indian Wells to Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva earlier this month, Sabalenka was determined not to fall at the last hurdle again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final," said Sabalenka, who paid tribute to Pegula's performance after repeating her win over her from last year's US Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players struggled to hold their serve in the first set, which saw seven breaks of serve, with Pegula causing Sabalenka some trouble when she brought her up to the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the momentum shifted when Pegula was serving to stay in the set at 6-5 down and Sabalenka turned it on, producing a delicate forehand drop and then a superb down the line winner to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once she recovered from being broken on her first service game of the second set, it was easier going for Sabalenka, whose bid for a third straight Australian Open title was thwarted in the Melbourne final by Madison Keys earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka broke twice to go 3-1 up and never looked in danger from that point on as she wrapped up the win in one hour 27 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her last 14 matches against top 10 players, Sabalenka has won 12 and she credited her ability in the clutch moments for her record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the third time that Pegula has faced Sabalenka in a final and she has lost on all three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best," Pegula conceded after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her," she added
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pegula, the world number four, said she was pleased to again have been a serious contender in a tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Sabalenka has now won eight WTA 1000 titles and 19 titles on the WTA Tour overall - 17 of which have come on hard courts including all three of her Grand Slam singles titles -- the 2023 Australian Open, the 2024 Australian Open and the 2024 US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  She looks a calmer, more focused, presence on court than in her earlier seasons when she was capable of bouts of rage when the going got tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka said that her struggles in the past with her serve had allowed her to develop a stronger all-round game and more positive mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's final on Sunday will feature Novak Djokovic up against Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik with the Serb looking for his 100th professional title. (AFP)

    Protesters target Tesla in anti-Musk campaign

<img alt="Protesters hold up signs outside a Tesla dealership in Michigan. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798089_1_20250330101458.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Demonstrators descended on Tesla dealerships across the United States and in Europe and Canada on Saturday to protest company chief Elon Musk, who has amassed extraordinary power as a top advisor to US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waving signs with messages like "Musk is stealing our money" and "Reclaim our country," the protests largely took place peacefully following fiery episodes of vandalism on Teslas in recent weeks that US officials have denounced as "terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds rallied Saturday outside the Tesla dealership in New York's Manhattan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some blasted Musk, the world's richest man, while others demanded the shuttering of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is dramatically slashing the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amy Neifeld, a 70-year-old psychologist who had not joined a protest since marching against the Vietnam War in the 1970s, accused Musk of leading the country toward fascism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jewish, so I grew up with a great awareness of fascism," she told AFP. "And it has just gotten uglier and uglier" since Trump returned to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He acts like he's the vice president," said New York protester Eva Mueller of musk. "He's dismantling, actively, our government, he's dismantling our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest was organized by the environmental activist group Planet Over Profit, which argues "stopping Musk will help save lives and protect our democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington's posh Georgetown neighbourhood, some 150 people gathered in a festive mood on an unseasonably warm day, dancing and cheering as passing cars honked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests also took place in Florida, Massachusetts and California, as well as in in European cities such as London, Berlin and Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canada's Vancouver, where around one hundred people protested at a Tesla dealership, one person in a dinosaur costume held a placard that said, "You thought the Nazis were extinct? Don't buy a Swasticar."
  <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Americans held signs outside a Tesla dealership in the French capital, including one that read "Send Musk to Mars now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Trump "are destroying our democracy, not obeying the basic rules of our country, and firing people at agencies that do very important work," said Raf, 59, a Paris protester who did not wish to give his last name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for reaction to the protests, Tesla did not immediately respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acts of vandalism against Tesla vehicles, dealerships and other facilities have spread for weeks, in protest both against Musk's ruthless job-cutting work, and what has been seen as his unwelcome interference in politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Attorney General Pam Bondi has denounced the attacks on Tesla as "domestic terrorism." (AFP)

    Mexico brings in junk food ban

<img alt="A man walks past a sign that refers to the labelling of products, in the subway of Mexico City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798081_1_20250330075336.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world’s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The health guidelines, first published last fall , take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavoured peanuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” And it encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogramme the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic .
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , has vowed to upend the nation's food system and “ Make America Healthy Again " by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labelling system in 2020 .
  <br>
  <br>
  Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , who has championed the effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexico’s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to Unicef, which classifies the nation’s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40 percent of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from US$545 to US$5,450.
  <br>
  <br>
  But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico’s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains and even reliable internet and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends. (AP)

    Japan beef bowl chain to shut stores over rat and bug

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese restaurant chain Sukiya will temporarily shut nearly all of its roughly 2,000 branches after a rat was found in a miso soup and a bug was found in another meal, the company said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sukiya, famous for its beef bowls, apologised in a statement saying a bug contamination at one of its Tokyo restaurants on Friday, two months after the rat incident at another branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sukiya has decided to temporarily close all restaurants, with the exception of some stores in shopping centres, from March 31 to April 4 in order to take measures against pests and vermin," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fast-food company has about 1,970 stores across Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nikkei business daily reported that its stores in shopping centres will also be closed as soon as arrangements are made with the facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food recalls are rare in Japan, a country with famously high sanitation standards, but food poisoning and recall incidents occasionally make headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, more than 100,000 packets of sliced bread were recalled after parts of a rat were discovered inside two bags. (AFP)

 Ending a 70-year wait for a domestic trophy deserves an official party.
 <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle will get one on Saturday when the team holds an open-top bus parade to celebrate their English League Cup title.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 150,000 fans are expected to join the celebration. The parade route runs from St James’ Park, through the city centre and ends at the Town Moor, an open space where a stage has been erected for an hour-long event that will include comments from players and a trophy lift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi-backed team beat Liverpool 2-1 nearly two weeks ago at Wembley Stadium for their first major domestic trophy since the FA Cup in 1955. The club also won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – a European competition – in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus was scheduled to set off from the stadium at 4:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has been nominated for a municipal honour called the "Freedom of the City." Club legends who have received the recognition include Alan Shearer, Bobby Robson and Shaka Hislop. (AP)

 Fans soaked up the raucous atmosphere at the new Kai Tak Stadium where the Hong Kong Sevens are being held for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Applause and cheers filled the air as day two of the tournament got underway, with many fans praising the party-like mood at the new stadium.
  <br>

   <br>
   One Australian spectator, Dan – who has been to many previous editions of the Sevens in Causeway Bay's Hong Kong Stadium – said he really likes the new venue.
   <br>
   <br>
   "It feels like the old stadium's atmosphere, just in a much more upgraded arena. It's a great new stadium."
   <br>
   <br>
   He said that besides Australia, he has thrown his support behind the Hong Kong, China squad in the Melrose Claymores competition – after both the men's and women's sides won big in both their respective matches earlier in the day.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The SAR squad] is always my next best team," he said. "The atmosphere when they play is amazing. I can't wait to see the stadium packed out, it's gonna be a great time."
   <br>

    <br>
    Another fan, from the United Kingdom, shared similar views on the new arena.
    <br>
    <br>
    "I think it's absolutely fantastic," he told RTHK. "Not only is [the stadium] bigger, you've got all those fancy light shows and the tech and everything. All the amenities and everything is so much better – absolutely amazing atmosphere."
    <br>
    <br>
    The stadium's South Stand – where many fans are known to gather in large numbers at the Sevens each year – reached maximum capacity just after 1pm.
    <br>

     "It's a great vibe here," another Australia fan, named Justin, said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There's space, you can walk around and meet all your friends and your mates. It's unreal."
     <br>
     <br>
     Meanwhile, rugby players said the roar of the crowd was electrifying.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We were so excited to be on the pitch. The crowds were very enthusiastic, cheering us on." Jiang Yutong, who plays for the national women's squad, told RTHK.
     <br>
     <br>
     "It feels so good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean firefighters deployed helicopters on Saturday as the country's biggest wildfires on record that ravaged wide areas of its southeast reignited in one of the region's cities, an official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen fires have been fanned by high winds and dry conditions, killing 30 people and injuring dozens more in southeastern regions, an interior ministry official said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fires were whipped up again early on Saturday in Andong, a city in the worst-hit North Gyeongsang province, forcing authorities to deploy eight helicopters to the area, said an official from the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came a day after the main fire in the province, where 26 of the 30 victims have died, was extinguished.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that the remaining embers have flared up a bit," said the official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We plan to deploy more helicopters to the area in Andong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires there began on Saturday last week and rolled on for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,900 homes in the region have been completely destroyed, according to the latest figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official said this week that more than 35,000 hectares (86,500 acres) of forest have been burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire also destroyed several historic sites, including the Gounsa temple complex in the southeastern city of Uiseong, which is believed to have been originally built in the 7th century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extent of the damage makes it South Korea's largest-ever wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Saturday, an official from the North Gyeongsang provincial government said helicopters were still being deployed in Andong areas to extinguish mostly small flames and smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the size of the area, it may take some time to complete all operations and fully extinguish the fires," said Do Gyu-myeong .
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the victims in the region were elderly, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those killed include a pilot in his 70s whose helicopter crashed on Wednesday while he was trying to contain a fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flames have been fanned by high winds and ultra-dry conditions, with the area experiencing below-average rains for months after South Korea had its hottest year on record in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said the wildfires were accidentally started by a grave visitor and "sparks from a brush cutter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Hye-young, a 65-year-old resident of Andong, said she still remains traumatised by the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really scary to see the sparks flying around all at once," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While living in North Gyeongsang, I never thought that such a large disaster would strike us." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force has arrested 157 people in relation to the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that 37 of the arrestees were aged below 21, and 16 of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure was recorded between February 14 – when etomidate, the drug's main ingredient was classified as a dangerous drug – and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters that police have stepped up enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from stepping up street patrols, we also have a lot of intelligence-led operations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 120 cases, the arrests for 70 of the cases were carried out on the streets, and another 50 were made in non-public places."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that all stakeholders, including school principals and teachers, as well as social workers, play a crucial role in tackling the space oil drug issue.

<img alt="Tim Hardaway Jr connected on seven of 11 from three-point range for Detroit. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798019_1_20250329151714.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Hardaway Jr scored 32 points to lead Detroit to a 133-122 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, a triumph that assured the Pistons of their first winning NBA season since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hardaway connected on seven of 11 from three-point range on the way to his season-high, leading seven Pistons players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included Ausar Thompson with 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder with 17 points and 10 assists as Detroit improved to 42-32 – tripling their win total from last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had to do it without Cade Cunningham, who missed a third straight game with a bruised calf, and Tobias Harris, who was a late scratch with Achilles tendon trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons withstood a 38-point performance from Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, who helped the Cavs erase a 21-point deficit to close within two with 3:31 to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit responded with a 12-1 run to seal the win, which most importantly pushed their lead for fifth place in the East to one and a half games over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 116-107 to the New York Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  OG Anunoby scored 20 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter for the Knicks, who handed the Bucks a third straight defeat despite 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists from Giannis Antetokounmpo – who returned after missing one game with a foot sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State superstar Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his return from a two-game absence with a pelvic contusion, lifting the Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the Pelicans in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors got off to a sluggish start against the struggling Pelicans, who were without Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Curry scored 13 points in the second quarter to help the Warriors keep it close despite woeful shooting from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he thought Curry "looked great" and his team as a whole looked better as the game went on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't love the passing in the first half, but we took care of the ball better in the second half," Kerr said. "All in all a positive outcome, a positive effort on a night where we're clearly trying to get our rhythm back as a group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors picked things up on both ends of the floor in the second half. Jimmy Butler added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State, who remained seventh in the West and battling to avoid the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers remained in sixth – the final spot for direct entry to the playoffs – after a 132-100 victory over the Nets in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers and Warriors have the same 42-31 record, the Clippers holding the head-to-head record tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves are just half a game back in eighth after a 124-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard scored 31 points to lead the Clippers, connecting on five of six three-point attempts and 10 of 14 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added six rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocks, and Ivica Zubac added 21 points on perfect nine-for-nine shooting as the Clippers notched their 10th win in their last 12 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Denver Nuggets, fuelled by 27 points and 14 rebounds from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, cruised past the Utah Jazz 129-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver led from start to finish, Jokic and the rest of their starters sitting out the fourth quarter of the rout. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang said on Saturday the government will step up its promotion on national security education next month, to achieve patriotism everywhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the SAR prepares to mark National Security Education Day on April 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with a local newspaper, Tsang pointed out that the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau will coordinate with relevant departments to promote national security at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister pointed out that since the Working Group on Patriotic Education was set up last year, it has strengthened national history and culture, as well as national affairs education on different fronts to widely promote the spirit of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the group will adopt short-, medium- and long-term goals and measures, Tsang said, adding that his bureau will continue to attach great importance and enhance national security education.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said Hong Kong will send a search and rescue team to Myanmar, after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The massive quake which struck central Myanmar on Friday, also affected neighbouring Thailand, with the death toll passing 1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, along with Secretary for Security Chris Tang sent the rescue team off at the airport in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the team is made up of professionals from multiple departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescue team has 51 members, including the team leader, who is a deputy chief fire officer. Other members come from the Security Bureau, the Fire Services and Immigration Departments and the Hospital Authority. There are also two doctors and two nurses,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in a Facebook post, the CE expressed condolences to the victims on behalf of all Hongkongers and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, for his part, said the rescue team would first fly to Yangon and then make a ten-hour drive to reach central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After arriving, the team will get in touch with the local commander in charge of the rescue operation. Then they will assess to situation and determine which areas and aspects of work the team can help with,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added the administration has so far received enquiries from 55 Hongkongers as of 5pm, but none of them required assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Hongkonger currently in Bangkok, which was also hit by the devastating earthquake on Friday, said he would not cancel his travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Siu said he was shopping with his wife when he felt the tremor, and the shaking had made people around panic and rush outside for safety.

  <br>
  “It has been a day since the earthquake, and there haven't been many aftershocks. Unless something significant happens, I don't plan to change my itinerary,” he told RTHK on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist who flew to Hong Kong from Bangkok on Saturday morning said that normalcy was being restored in the Thai capital after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Transport] is back. Everything is fine today, It’s better than yesterday. But I am still sad about the earthquake. I was working on the 25th floor. I felt the earthquake, [I was] so shocked,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it would continue to monitor the situation and work with Chinese Embassies in Thailand and Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, local travel agency, WWPKG, said it will cancel all tour groups to Thailand in April. It said about 150 affected customers can either choose to switch to a different tour or receive a full refund.

<img alt="Health chief Lo Chung-mau hopes the public can turn to other choices than A&E when the new fees take effect next year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797998_1_20250329122451.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says he hopes some people can find alternatives to accident and emergency wards at public hospitals at all times when new fees take effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  From next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients - or those who are classified as category three to five patients - will have to pay HK$400 when they visit A&E, up from the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope higher fees for non-critical and non-emergency patients will deter them, so urgent cases can receive prompt care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said some patients abused A&E services, such as heading there to get a sick leave certificate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the low charges, A&E are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a-year. It's very convenient, and people don't need to make a booking in advance. You only need to go straight to the wards, which is very convenient. This is necessary for those who are critically ill or need resuscitation," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said a small group of people abused the system, but some people really misused it... I believe the public need to change this mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo pointed out that if A&E doctors - who were specially trained to save critically ill patients - had to take care of patients with mild illnesses, that would be a waste of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients with minor problems should head to their family doctors instead, the health chief said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also told an RTHK radio programme that almost half of the semi- and non-urgent - or category four and five patients - showed up at A&E between 8am and 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period, there are definitely other choices than A&E, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that the revamp was not aimed at helping the government tackle its budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  We are only aiming to better safeguard patients and reduce wastage, he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

<img alt="A rescuer works at the site of the skyscraper that collapsed in Bangkok. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797995_1_20250329121851.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from the massive earthquake in Myanmar has passed 1,600, the ruling junta there said on Saturday, with more than 3,400 injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the junta's information team said 1,644 people are known to have died in Friday's shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, with 3,408 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has extended condolences to Myanmar's leader, and a rescue team from Yunnan Province – that borders Myanmar – arrived on Saturday morning at Yangon in Myanmar to provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said the only highway linking Myanmar's Yangon in the south and central Naypyidaw and Mandalay was severely damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second-biggest city, Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10 more deaths have so far been confirmed in Bangkok, where rescuers laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres away from the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists. (Agencies)

    'Longer grace period doesn't mean landlords can relax'

<img alt="The administration has introduced a countdown period to penalise landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797986_1_20250329102422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said she hoped landlords of subdivided flats would take action to upgrade them, even though they now had a longer grace period to comply with new criteria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Housing Bureau's latest proposal for a regulatory framework to manage the city’s subdivided units, landlords will be given a 36-month grace period to make necessary improvements so they can be certified as Basic Housing Units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grace period was previously proposed as 12 - or up to 24 months - after a 12-month registration period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration has also introduced a countdown period, starting six months before the end of the grace period.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the countdown period, landlords who enter new tenancy contracts for units that haven’t been certified may face a maximum fine of HK$300,000 and be jailed for up to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told a Commercial Radio programme that she hoped landlords wouldn't leave their renovations until the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just like when we were in university and the lecturer gave us two extra weeks to finish our coursework, some students would just go watch a movie, thinking they had plenty of time. We want to avoid that with landlords. Even though the grace period is extended, we need to introduce some kind of enforcement to ensure they stay on track and don’t get too relaxed,” said Ho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords also have to hire a certified professional to assess their units in order to obtain the Basic Housing Unit recognition, which will be valid for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the list of certified professionals has been expanded to include some 8,000 engineers, which now also feature specialists under the disciplines of fire and building services.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is payable to the government for the certification process and the housing minister said the charge would be around a few thousand dollars, although the exact amount has yet to be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s revised Basic Housing Units legislation will be discussed in Legco's housing panel on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first group of 50 light public housing tenants moved into their flats in Yuen Long on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 50 to 100 tenants would move in every day and the plan is to get all 2,156 tenants for the Yau Pok Road project to move in by the end of May.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An original animatronic model of the iconic alien created for Steven Spielberg's classic 1982 film "ET the Extra-Terrestrial" is for sale at Sotheby's and is estimated to fetch as much as US$900,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Created by Oscar-winning special effects artist Carlo Rambaldi, the model is one of three used in the film and is specifically the one featured in the closet scene when ET is hiding among loads of stuffed animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model - which stands 91.4 centimetres tall, according to Sotheby's listing - is from the personal collection of Rambaldi, an animatronics pioneer who died in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The starting bid is US$500,000 in the online sale, which closes on April 3. The estimated price is from US$600,000 to US$900,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This model embodies the artistry of an era before CGI took hold, a nostalgic and iconic piece of Hollywood history as captivating as the stories themselves," said Cassandra Hatton, a Sotheby's vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ET model was able to perform 150 different movements, such as frowning or stretching his neck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rambaldi collaborated on other blockbuster sci-fi films including Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977), Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) and John Guillermin's "King Kong" (1976).
  <br>
  <br>
  The auction includes other objects from the Italian artist's collection, including two of the model sandworms used in David Lynch's "Dune." (AFP)

    Trump, Carney hail 'extremely productive' call

<img alt="During the call, Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797975_1_20250329071156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said he had an "extremely productive" first call Friday with Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, after soaring tensions over tariffs and Trump's wish to annex his northern neighbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump added that the two planned to meet soon after Canada's April 28 general election in which Carney - who took office two weeks ago - has made standing up to the US president the focus of his campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just finished speaking with Prime Minister Mark Carney, of Canada. It was an extremely productive call, we agree on many things," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Typically, a new Canadian leader makes a phone call with the US president an immediate priority, but this was Trump and Carney's first contact since the Canadian was sworn in on March 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's office said the pair had a "very constructive conversation" and agreed to begin "comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added, however, that Carney told Trump his government would impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods from April 2, when sweeping US levies are set to come into place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to back down, we're going to respond with force," Carney said at an afternoon press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. And we're not the one's who changed," he added, confirming that Canada needed to look to Europe "to strengthen ties with reliable partners."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the coming weeks, months and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's glowing post was still a dramatic change in tone from recent rhetoric between Washington and Ottawa, who are Nato allies and long-standing economic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has sparked fury in Canada by repeatedly insisting it should become the 51st US state and by slapping or threatening tariffs on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  His post on Friday was notable for its diplomacy, as Trump gave Carney his official title of prime minister and made no reference to his annexation drive. (AFP)

 Stock markets plunged Friday as a closely watched US inflation reading heated up amid intensifying concerns over fallout from US President Donald Trump's incoming wave of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automakers fell further as they brace for 25 percent US tariffs due to kick in next week along with a raft of "reciprocal" surcharges tailored to different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market mood has soured over fears that Trump's plans will trigger tit-for-tat measures that would rekindle inflation, which could put the brakes on interest rate cuts and spark a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors remain nervous over the economic repercussions from President Trump's tariff threats, just days before he unleashes his 'reciprocal tariffs'" on April 2, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London just about held the line, closing barely off in the week's final session. But Paris, Frankfurt and Milan all slid around one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed sharply lower, with the Dow tumbling 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 losing 2.0 percent and Nasdaq diving 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide came after official data showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, remained unchanged last month at 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another key figure, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose more than expected at 2.8 percent in February on an annual basis, up from the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, automakers Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Peugeot and Fiat, fared particularly badly. Shares in General Motors and Ford also slumped on Wall Street. (AFP)

<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance demanded Denmark change its approach as President Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797969_1_20250329062730.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance accused Denmark on Friday of not having done enough to protect Greenland when he visited the resource-rich Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vance made his comment during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, a visit viewed by Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message to Denmark is basic: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland," Vance told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not talking about peace for the United States. We are talking about world peace. We are talking about international security," Trump claimed to reporters at the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the potential use of force, Vance stressed that the US administration did not think it was "ever going to be necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen hit back at Vance in a statement to Danish media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For many years, we have stood by the Americans in very difficult situations," she said, referring to Danish combat deployments alongside American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vice President's reference to Denmark is not accurate," she said, expressing her readiness to "cooperate day and night with the Americans" on Arctic security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha; National Security Advisor Mike Waltz; Energy Secretary Chris Wright; Utah Senator Mike Lee; and former Homeland Security Advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's desire to take over the ice-covered territory, which is seeking independence from Denmark, has been categorically rejected by Greenlanders, their politicians and Danish officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all of Greenland's political parties favour independence, none of them support the idea of becoming part of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new broad four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said the territory needed unity at this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is critical that we put aside our disagreements and differences... because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside," he said when he unveiled his government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nielsen said that by visiting Greenland when there was no government in office there, the US administration was "not showing respect to an ally". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said the SAR government is taking forward a series of initiatives to protect intellectual property rights to help develop the city into a regional IP trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking after visiting a company in Beijing that had developed toys with proprietary intellectual property that had found success in both domestic and overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau noted that the effective protection and efficient transaction of IP is crucial to promoting the development of cultural and creative industries as well as technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also met with representatives of the China Alcoholic Drinks Association to promote opportunities for wine merchants in Hong Kong following the deduction in liquor duty announced in last October’s Policy Address, which had resulted in increases in both the quantity and value of liquor imported into the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said Hong Kong could serve as a key hub for trading and distribution of high-end liquor, including Chinese baijiu, and Mainland wine merchants are encouraged to use Hong Kong as a platform for Chinese baijiu to go global.

    CK Hutchison ports deal 'won't be signed next week'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A controversial ports deal between CK Hutchison and a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock won’t be signed as expected next week – according to a source with close links to the Hong Kong conglomerate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based firm owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing announced earlier this month that it had entered into a in-principle agreement to sell 45 ports from 23 countries – including two ports near the Panama Canal – in a US$23 billion deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A filing to the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing stated that the negotiations would last 145 days, with reports suggesting both sides were planning to sign "definitive documents" on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the source on Friday revealed that the signing will not happen next week, saying, “Everyone knows why.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation's anti-monopoly branch told the Ta Kung Wen Wei Media Group that it will conduct a review of the deal in accordance with the law to protect fair competition and safeguard the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local deputy to the National People’s Congress and chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Stanley Ng, said anything irregular that’s discovered in the review should be halted immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng further stressed that influential businessmen here must have a sense of national security and consider matters from the perspective of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here have both repeatedly reposted articles from Ta Kung Pao criticising the deal.

    Hong Kong victorious on opening day of Rugby Sevens

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay Pacific flight to Bangkok was forced to return to Hong Kong after take-off on Friday after a deadly earthquake that hit Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The powerful tremor left at least several people dead and dozens wounded in the two Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking websites, CX751 took off at Hong Kong International Airport just after 3pm, and was near Hainan island when it made a u-turn. It landed at Chek Lap Kok just before 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority's website suggested the flight will set off again at 8.15pm on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other Cathay Pacific flights to and from Bangkok today (Friday) are expected to experience delays," the SAR flag carrier said. "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Bangkok-bound Cathay flight CX630 also returned to Singapore after take-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other flights on Friday between the SAR and Thailand were unaffected, according to the Airport Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines said in a statement that services remain normal, while offering to change flights for passengers who have booked trips to and from Bangkok between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local carrier, Hong Kong Airlines, cautioned that its flights to and from Bangkok "may be affected" due to the earthquake, advising passengers to check the latest information before heading to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Airlines will waive all charges on rebooking, reissue and refund for all tickets issued for travel on Hong Kong Airlines flights with confirmed booking," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Travel Industry Council said there are around six Hong Kong tour groups in Thailand, consisting less than 100 people. All of them are safe, the council confirmed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday urged a gathering of multinational CEOs to protect global industry and supply chains, amid threats of more US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We need to work together to maintain the stability of global industry and supply chains, which is an important guarantee for the healthy development of the world economy," Xi told the business leaders, who included the bosses of AstraZeneca, FedEx, Saudi Aramco, Standard Chartered and Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can take a broad perspective, not be swayed by transient distractions in the industry, and not blindly follow actions that disrupt the security and stability of global industry and supply chains."
  <br>
  <br>
  Without referring directly to US tariffs, Xi also warned that "unilateralism and protectionism" were on the rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Multilateralism is the inevitable choice for addressing the difficulties and challenges facing the world, and economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical trend," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 40 executives joined the meeting, the majority of whom represented the pharmaceuticals sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives sat in a horseshoe formation, with Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kallenius and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam sitting directly across from Xi. HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery, SK Hynix boss Kwak Noh-jung, Saudi Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser, and chair of Hitachi Toshiaki Higashihara also sat in the first row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign enterprises contribute one-third of China's imports and exports, one-quarter of industrial added value and one-seventh of tax revenue, creating more than 30 million jobs," Xi noted.

  "In recent years, foreign investment in China has also been interfered with by geopolitical factors... I often say that blowing out other people's lights does not make you brighter," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The President also said foreign businesses and investment in China have driven economic growth and employment, boosted technological and managerial progress, and facilitated reform and opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of this shows that foreign businesses are important participants in the Chinese modernisation drive, in the country's reform and opening up and innovation, and in its interconnectivity with the world and integration into economic globalisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this process, foreign businesses have thrived and generally enjoyed handsome returns, achieved win-win results, and forged profound friendship with the Chinese people, Xi added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby fans from around the world showered praise on the brand new stadium in Kai Tak as this year's Hong Kong Sevens got underway on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After decades at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, the three-day tournament has moved to Kai Tak Stadium, which can accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in the South Stand told RTHK that the new stadium modernises the tournament with new facilities and a large variety of food and drinks, all while preserving the event's rich traditions, including vibrant costumes, lively music and a passionate crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zwelethu Kala from South Africa said he loves the new venue and that the fans have brought the same energy from the old stadium to Kai Tak Sporks Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a beautiful stadium, wow! Biggest thing is, one, it now has a roof so it can close, get full-running rugby. And two, outside, the village, wow," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You also have a DJ outside, nice space for the kids to play in as well. It's just awesome. It's looking really, really good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexane, who travelled from Belgium with friends for her second Sevens, said Hong Kong is the ultimate destination for international rugby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the main place. It's so interesting. It's the main city to go for rugby. I don't know anything about rugby, but Hong Kong is like the best place," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The stadium is filled with] amazing colours. I really like the colours and everything is so practical. Honestly, there's so much room for tourists, and it's really nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Larger crowds. More cosy because we have aircon. I would like them to open [the roof], so the atmosphere would be better," said local fan Damon Wong, who was sporting a headpiece from the Japanese manga Chiikawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from the SAR, Matt Grange, highlighted the improved amenities, praising the stadium's additional toilets and impressive food and drink outlets, including one of Asia's longest bars.

 The earthquake in Myanmar was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometres northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. (AP)

    MTR fares to freeze under adjustment mechanism
   </title>

<img alt="While MTR fares will freeze for 2025-26, commuters could face a steep hike next year after 3.36 percent of adjustments are brought forward. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797892_1_20250328173801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

 Myanmar's ruling junta made a rare request for international humanitarian aid and declared a state of emergency across six regions after a powerful quake hit the country on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing was seen arriving at a hospital in Naypyidaw where wounded were being treated after the quake hit central Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a response, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was ready to offer "all possible assistance" to Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Praying for the safety and wellbeing of everyone," Modi wrote on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "India stands ready to offer all possible assistance. In this regard, asked our authorities to be on standby." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major hospital in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw is a "mass casualty area" after the country was rocked by a huge earthquake, an official at the facility said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The entrance of the emergency department at the city's main hospital pancaked onto a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hospital official said that "this is a mass casualty area."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another official said hundreds of injured people had arrived at the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't seen [anything] like this before," a doctor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to handle the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so exhausted now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The route to the hospital was jammed with vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance tried to make its way through, a paramedic shouting "cars, move aside so the ambulance can get through."
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts and some homes toppling to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the National Museum in Yangon, pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the former royal palace and buildings were damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the area is prone to earthquakes, it is generally sparsely populated, and most houses are low-rise structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, the 90-year-old Ava Bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Yangon rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. (Agencies)

    <br>
    Kai Tak Sports Park director of strategic planning, Tang King-shing, meanwhile, said the spectator flow was smooth with frequent MTR train services.
    <br>
    <br>
    He also said rugby fans will find it easy to get to the stadium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a 30-storey building under construction for government offices collapsed when the earthquake hit around midday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medics say at least 43 workers are trapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-storey building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's stock exchange said on it is on "full halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  The midday temblor was followed by a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude. (Agencies)

    ICAC chief lays down law on calls for invalid votes

<img alt="Danny Woo says the ICAC has started using an AI system to improve work efficiency. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797856_2_20250328151239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top graft-buster, Danny Woo, on Friday warned that authorities will take tough action against those who call for invalid votes to be cast during the upcoming election for the city's legislature at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came after Chief Executive John Lee last week announced that the general election for the Legislative Council will be held on December 7, with a by-election to be held on September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with local media, Woo, who heads the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), reminded the public that disrupting the electoral process is a legal offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Never ever try to challenge the law because it's clearly written that it's an offence for any person to incite others not to vote or to cast invalid votes through any public activities during the election period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also do not share or repost these remarks as there is a chance of breaking the law as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Woo noted that the number of complaints reported to the ICAC rose to 2,058 last year, three percent higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-four of the cases were made against the Hong Kong Correctional Services, and that was more than double that of a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Woo pointed out, only a small number of the cases reached the prosecution phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC, he said, is seeking to use artificial intelligence to improve work efficiency and has launched an AI system, Dr Deep, based on mainland firm DeepSeek's AI models, to help combat corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that many of our own systems are developed by ourselves because many of them contain confidential and sensitive information," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our computer systems are studied and maintained in-house and not operated on by outsiders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means our development of AI is also done by ourselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since DeepSeek unveiled its large AI models, it's been a real eye-opener," Woo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hinted that the Dr Deep system could be available for public use in the future and that residents could search for corruption-related information on the system.

<img alt="Myanmar's military chief Min Aung Hlaing marks Armed Forces Day in Naypyidaw on Thursday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797854_1_20250328135837.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will join a regional leaders' summit in Thailand next week where he is seeking high-level bilateral meetings, said three sources with direct knowledge, in a rare visit to a Southeast Asian country since seizing power in coup that led to a civil war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Aung Hlaing is the subject of widespread western sanctions and is barred from attending summits of the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN due to the Myanmar military's failure to implement an agreed peace plan with the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will join the April 3-4 summit in Bangkok of the BIMSTEC grouping of mostly South Asian countries, where the Myanmar delegation is seeking bilateral meetings with leaders and top officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings being sought include ones with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, Muhammed Yunus, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been reaching out asking for meetings," one of the sources said, referring to Myanmar officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking mass protests that escalated into an armed rebellion against the junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a third of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief said on Thursday said an election would be held in December, promising a free and fair vote and to transfer state power to the winning party. (Reuters)

<img alt="Jessica Pegula has a word with Alexandra Eala after squeezing through to the finals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797850_2_20250328133508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippines sensation Alexandra Eala's remarkable run at the Miami Open came to a brave end with a three-set loss to Jessica Pegula in the semi-finals on Friday Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an enthralling and exhausting battle over two hours and 24 minutes, fourth-seeded American Pegula emerged with a 7-6 (7/3) 5-7 6-3 win to seal a place in Saturday's final against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old Eala, ranked 140th in the world, had only two WTA main draw victories to her name before arriving in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proceeded to beat three Grand Slam winners in Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and world number two Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lowest-ranked semi-finalist in the tournament's history, Eala seriously threatened to go one step further with another accomplished and effervescent display.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tide looked to have turned against her when Pegula broke to go 3-1 up in the second set, but Eala broke back and her fist pump and look of determination was a sign of things to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke Pegula three times in the set and was broken twice herself but crucially was able to hold when serving for the set at 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players protected their serve better in the deciding set but Eala's forehand let her down when the American broke to go 5-3 up and she served out for a victory that brought her visible relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka blasted her way into the final with a convincing 6-2 6-2 demolition of Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka needed just 71 minutes to wrap up her win against the sixth seed and with the win the Belarusian, who was beaten in the Indian Wells final earlier this month by Mirra Andreeva, will appear in the Miami final for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played today. Of course super happy to be in my first Miami Open final," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was never behind against Paolini and the match was only tied twice – at 1-1 in each set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She served six aces and broke the Italian's serve four times,
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely would say that this was one of the best matches in the season so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know. I was just so focused on myself, on the things I had to do today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt like everything was just going smoothly my way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will be keen to banish the memory of defeat in the Indian Wells final and in the Australian Open final, where she lost to Keys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lessons [of those defeats] was I believe focus on myself, not on what's going on the other side," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in those finals I was more focusing on my opponents than on myself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just have to bring the same attitude, the same mindset that I had today, I think I have to bring it in the finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really feel this time I'm going to do better than I did in the last two finals," added the 26-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is only the sixth woman to reach the finals of both stops on the American "Sunshine Swing" in the same season. (AFP)

    Rallies set as Duterte marks 80th birthday in prison

<img alt="Relatives of drug war and extrajudicial killing victims in Quezon City watch a live telecast of the initial appearance of Rodrigo Duterte at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797846_1_20250328130849.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Family and supporters of former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte will rally on Friday to mark his 80th birthday and protest his detention in The Hague on a charge of crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte could spend the rest of his life in jail if convicted at the International Criminal Court (ICC) of the charge tied to his "war on drugs" in which thousands were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters are planning more than 200 simultaneous birthday rallies demanding his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, his eldest daughter, has been in the Dutch city for more than two weeks helping assemble his legal team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's daughters, 20-year-old Veronica as well as her mother, Cielito Avancena, said they failed to get inside the prison to see him on Wednesday – but remained hopeful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will make sure I get to see him," Veronica told a Philippine television network outside the ICC detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another of the ex-president's sons is expected, as well as his ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman, according to Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's arrest on March 11 and rapid handover to the international tribunal came on the heels of his family's bitter falling out with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cracks began to appear in their alliance soon after Marcos teamed up with Sara Duterte to sweep the presidential and vice presidential elections in May 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president quit her cabinet post as education secretary after being denied the defence portfolio, while Duterte himself began calling Marcos a drug addict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Sara Duterte was impeached by a pro-Marcos House of Representatives on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outcome of her Senate trial will likely depend on the number of seats her allies win in May 12 mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of her party's candidates, former Philippine police chief and drug war enforcer Ronald Dela Rosa, says he expects to be arrested by the ICC next.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-president faces a six-month wait inside the United Nations' Scheveningen prison before his next scheduled court appearance on September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is only allowed two visits per day – a lawyer and a family member, said the vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I urged him to write a book and then when you get out, we'll sell it and make money out of it," she said. (AFP)

<img alt="The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has surpassed the record set last year by 70 percent. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797841_1_20250328124759.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Big swings in stock markets and hedge fund activity have propelled Hong Kong's derivative trading to unprecedented highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has reached 22 million so far this year, surpassing the record set in 2024 by 70 percent in less than three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts and investors attribute the sharp rise in the use of derivatives this year to the craze around Chinese technology firms and the growing use of hedging tools by long-short funds to navigate geopolitical and tariff uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has boosted its derivatives offering over the past six months to meet the market's growing demand as investors look to gain more exposure to Chinese assets in a way that helps lower their risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  New product launches have included Weekly Hang Seng Tech Index Options as well as weekly options for 10 individual stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Options, particularly those betting on large tech companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Xiaomi, have dominated the increase in trading, the analysts and investors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen meaningful pick-up in single stock options activities," said Jason Lui, head of APAC equity and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  By entering into call or put options contracts, investors make leveraged bets on the future price movements of the underlying assets but limit losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outsized gains in some very large companies have spurred investors to trade single stock options to maximise returns, Lui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's low-cost artificial intelligence reasoning model DeepSeek and President Xi Jinping's rare meeting with tech entrepreneurs have sent the Hang Seng Index up 17 percent this year. E-commerce giant Alibaba and smartphone and EV maker Xiaomi have surged 50 percent each to lead the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big stock swings often come with high volatility, posing particular risks to the Chinese market, which still faces tariff threats from US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Arete, a Hong Kong-based US$1 billion macro hedge fund, recently boosted its China equity exposure while staying hedged for potential market turbulence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the primary uncertainties we're trying to navigate is the US-China relationship and geopolitics broadly," said Yuexin Zeng, head of investor relations at Ocean Arete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volatility will "remain higher for longer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A volatility gauge tracking the Hang Seng Index hit a two-year high in October and rose again last month when the Hong Kong benchmark skyrocketed to a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hedge fund Aspoon Capital, which generated a 14 percent return in the first two months this year, is adding China tech index put options to hedge the tariff risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do think the market can be too complacent about the tariff now," Aspoon Chief Investment Officer Ryan Yin said in a newsletter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derivatives trading "absolutely has been strong in the last three to six months for China underlying [assets]," said Nick Silver, head of prime services for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have had to become much more familiar with trading in a choppy and sometimes downward trending market in recent years, he said, "and using derivatives is probably the best, most efficient way to do that." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Giddey buried a miracle shot from beyond halfcourt at the final buzzer as the Chicago Bulls overturned an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 119-117.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Bulls (33-40) trailed 115-110 with 12.6 seconds remaining before delivering down the stretch with a wild sequence of plays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Williams hit a 3-pointer to trim the deficit back to two points before Giddey, who moments earlier had airballed a floater, stole LeBron James' inbound pass, flicked the pass to White, who drained a trey to put Chicago in front 116-115 with 6.1 seconds to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers retrieved the lead on an Austin Reaves layup with 3.3 seconds on the clock, before the Bulls, who had no timeouts left, struck at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey passed the inbound to Williams, who gave it straight back and the Australian nailed the game-winning 47-foot prayer over James.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey finished with 25 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season, while Coby White scored 26 points and Kevin Huerter added 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves scored 30 points for the Lakers, and Luka Doncic had 25 points, 10 boards and eight assists. Jaxson Hayes contributed 19 points, and James paired 17 points with 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' lead had ballooned to 91-75 on the back of a commanding 32-17 third period in which they dominated the Bulls at both ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers set a club record by scoring 162 points in their 53-point win over the Washington wizards, who also gave up the most points in their franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers scored five more than the previous record set last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton led the way with 29 points for the Pacers, becoming one of nine players who scored in double figures. (Reuters)

    'Use AI chatbots in triage system to avoid mistakes'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="A patients' rights group has proposed the use of AI chatbots in triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797824_1_20250328114303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A patients' rights group says it hopes the government can use AI chatbots in its triage system at public hospitals to help patients gain a better understanding of their conditions and symptoms.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I have used the UK emergency service as well,” WeCareBill Foundation co-founder Kelly Yim said in RTHK's Backchat programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I find it quite useful when they have the AI chatbot to do the challenging bits, like differentiating the level of emergency of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm just thinking maybe we can do this with nurse consultations or triages, and try with more advanced technology so that maybe this risk [of misjudgements] can be mitigated.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people have expressed worries about being charged more because of being categorised wrongly during triages when the revamped healthcare charges come into effect from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the changes, "critical" and "emergency" patients being treated at  accident and emergency (A&E) wards will have their charges exempted, while fees for “urgent”, “semi-urgent” and “non-urgent” patients will be raised to HK$400 from HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has relaxed income and asset limits to expand eligibility for medical fee waivers and said about 1.4 million people are expected to benefit from the tweaks, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, an official from the Hospital Authority reiterated that the revamp is aimed at focusing resources on serving those in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With all these measures, we are trying to reserve our healthcare resources [in order to help, in particular, acute, serious and critical patients]," the authority’s chief manager in allied health,  Priscilla Poon, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But at the same time, we won't forget [the less well-off sections of the public].
  <br>
  <br>
  “So that's the reason why we need ... balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to impose some kind of relaxation of our waiver mechanisms and safety net in order to help ... the poor, who are not really actually supported by other, say, private services.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a former A&E doctor also urged the government to prioritise the implementation of advanced technology to help cope with a manpower shortage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Lee, who’s now a clinical assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the new fees planned for emergency wards at public hospitals could reduce the burden on staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the effect may only be short-term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This effect will tail off," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw it with previous increases in fees in the departments before,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So there must be some implementation of more important measures in the departments...
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be implementation of the AI system, not only in the A&E departments, but also maybe at the primary-care level.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a big burden would be lifted from the public healthcare system if patients were able to conduct some sort of tests themselves before deciding whether to seek medical attention at hospitals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met with representatives of the international business community in Beijing following last weekend's China Development Forum (CDF), Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is firmly committed to advancing reform and opening up. The door of opening up will only open wider and wider," Xi told the executives, including hedge fund boss Ray Dalio and Samsung Electronics chief Lee Jae-yong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is committed to high-quality development and accelerating green, digital and intelligent transformation, and has strong industrial supporting capacity," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign enterprises in China can develop their advantages and capabilities and gain an advantage in global competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the global heads of German automakers BMW and Mercedes, as well as chip giant Qualcomm were among the foreign business leaders attending the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's gathering also followed a similar one last year, which saw the first meeting between Xi and foreign business leaders after the CDF.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's CDF saw Premier Li Qiang urge countries to open their markets and combat "rising instability and uncertainty". (Agencies)

    Rubio says too early for high-level Russia talks

<img alt="Marco Rubio says US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings with Russia. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797827_1_20250328115755.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned on Thursday it was premature to expect high-level talks with Russia, while the United States weighs Moscow's response to Washington's efforts to end the Ukraine war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if it was time for higher-level talks after indirect US negotiations with the two sides in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said: "I think you have to make more progress on a technical level."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of work to be done with both sides, particularly with the Russian side, which we haven't talked to for years," Rubio said on his plane to his home city of Miami from a three-nation Caribbean tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On how long it would take to make progress, Rubio said, "I just can't put a timeframe on that because it doesn't depend on us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said US President Donald Trump's administration would hold consultations to discuss the outcome of the meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly said he hopes to meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, likely in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States announced on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold fire in strikes on the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Russia later said it had conditions, as it seeks relief from the sweeping sanctions imposed by the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had earlier called on Russia to accept unconditionally a Ukrainian-backed proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron has rejected Russian calls for an easing of Western sanctions, saying it was far too early and more progress was needed. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At the official opening of the Boao Forum for Asia on Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said China's economy was remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, Andrew Leung, on Friday told Carol Musgrave that Beijing's achievements in science and technology were key to the nation's success and the vice premier's speech aimed to highlight that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As far as innovation is concerned, we are in the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions, with a digital global economy, connectivity, changing the way we conduct our lives, how businesses are conducted and indeed how countries trade and interact with one another, and of course China's technological innovation, particularly self-reliance, was mandated by President Xi [Jinping]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said China was overcoming the barriers to trade and technology that the United States was throwing at it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has been progressing by leaps and bounds as illustrated by China's ability to build a space station from scratch... all this shows that innovation is the way to go."

    'Kowloon City won't be congested during the Sevens'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Kowloon City district councillor believes the area will not be congested when Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament games end every evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day tournament that kicks off today will be staged at Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time ever, having been held at Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, Vivian Wong, who also chairs a working group on boosting the local economy in the district, said previous test events at the new grounds had gone smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Hong Kong Sevens, spectators will be coming in and out at all times," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They won't enter or leave at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, it's kind of different than, say, the opening ceremony on March the first when they could test out what problems would arise if people left the venue all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from visiting nearby malls and Kowloon City, Wong expects spectators will also head for the new Sevens fan village for live music, meet-and-greet opportunities with rugby teams, as well as drinks and food booths.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the inaugural Kai Tak Dining Cove Carnival next to the Kai Tak Stadium will also be a lure for revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Kowloon City restaurant owner revealed on the same show that businesses near the stadium are already seeing a boom in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Lam pointed out that business in the area had gone up 20 percent whenever tests events were held, as well as during the stadium's opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  His eatery has been flexible with its opening hours whenever events are scheduled at the city's largest sports venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, before the pandemic, our restaurant closed at 3am," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business was booming at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after and during the pandemic, the catering business was sluggish. We had to close by 10:30 or 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the Kai Tak Sports Park opening, now we close around 1 o'clock in the morning, and we open at 11:30am, with no breaks during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So customers can come during lunch, tea, or after shows at the venue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedestrian traffic in the district had surged by 20 to 30 percent during the stress tests and the opening ceremony, Lam added.

 President Xi Jinping met Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus in Beijing on Friday, state media reported, as Dhaka's relations with neighbouring India remains shaky.

  Yunus took charge of Bangladesh last August after the toppling of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi after an uprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 84-year-old Nobel laureate flew to Beijing on Wednesday and met with Xi on Friday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported, without giving further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yunus is expected to return to Bangladesh on Saturday after holding several other high-level meetings in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  India was the biggest benefactor of Hasina's government, and her overthrow sent cross-border relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dhaka's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said on Tuesday that Bangladesh was "sending a message" with Yunus's choice to spend his first state visit in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agreements are expected to be signed on economic and technical assistance, cultural and sports cooperation, and media collaboration between the two countries, according to the Bangladeshi administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks are also expected to touch on Bangladesh's immense population of Rohingya refugees, most of whom fled a violent military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017. (AFP)

 When Hong Kong artist Movana Chen moved to Lisbon in 2021, she started knitting together maps collected during Covid isolation in an attempt to unravel physical boundaries.
 <br>
  <br>
  She transformed the maps into large pieces of garment donned by herself and her partner, dancer Francisco Borges, as part of a performance art piece at Art Basel Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <img src="https://rthk-s3-nps-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mfile_1797813_2_L_20250328104141.jpg">
   <div class="image-title-1">
    <span>
    </span>
   </div>
   <br>
   The inspiration for the performance – which sees the pair cocooned in the weaved-together maps – came from Chen’s time living near the Portuguese seaside, when she experienced pandemic-induced solitude.
   <br>
   <br>
   "[The act of weaving together] the maps is like inviting people and my friends during the lockdown period. So like in 2020, people can't send me the maps during that time. Everything was closed," she said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Chen said their performance, titled "Questioning the Line", also explores the entanglement between human and nature and the roles of borders and nationality.
   <br>
   <br>
   "For us it has different layers of lines, different lines to question. For example, one of the lines is this, between human and nature. Where is that line really?" Chen's partner, Borges told RTHK.
   <br>
   <br>
   "We are born from the land, we eat the food from the land, we drink the water from the land. And when we poison the land, and we poison the water, we poison ourselves. So where is really that barrier, that clear line?" he said.
   <br>

    <div class="image-title-1">
     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    To show human unity and interdependence, Chen also collects expired passports and gives them new life by knitting them together in a separate project called "Beyond the Surface".
    <br>
    <br>
    She is not the only artist exploring humanity and nature at this year's Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    American painter and writer Alec Egan lost his home and studio to the Los Angeles fire in January. Despite the devastation, he created five new paintings to depict LA coastal scenes in a temporary studio provided by Anat Egbi Gallery, which is showcasing his works at Art Basel.
    <br>
    <br>
    Egan's new works – which reflects both disaster and nature – pays homage to his lost work and captures the eerie beauty of ash-filled skies.
    <br>

     <br>
     "In the face of something really traumatic, he continues to focus on beauty and there is quiet solitude. So I hope that [audiences will take away] hopefulness," said the gallery's sales director Amanda McMorran.
     <br>
     <br>
     Adding another compelling voice to the fair is first-time exhibitor Shin Min from Seoul's P21 studio.
     <br>

      Drawing from her experience working in the service industry, her "Ew! There is hair in the food!!" exhibition highlights misogyny in Korea, and challenges the notion of never saying no to customers.
      <br>
      <br>
      "I talk about workers' hair because we are not robots. We are human and we are not machines. We have hair. We have spit," Shin said in explaining the central message of her work.

    Rubio warns Venezuela against Guyana attacks

<img alt="Guyanese President Mohamed Irfaan Ali, left, with Marco Rubio in Georgetown, Guyana. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797818_1_20250328105815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top US diplomat Marco Rubio bluntly warned Venezuela against attacking its oil-rich neighbour Guyana, brandishing the power of the US military to protect the small South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

<img alt="Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers were also winners to start the new campaign. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797817_2_20250328105734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Rodon pitched effectively into the sixth inning and was backed by two early homers as the host New York Yankees hung on for a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the season opener for both teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Austin Wells hit a leadoff homer three pitches into the home half of the first inning and Anthony Volpe connected in the second as the Yankees improved to 7-1 in season openers under manager Aaron Boone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Judge added an RBI double in the seventh and Cody Bellinger followed that at-bat with a sacrifice fly in his Yankees debut. Those runs proved crucial when New York's new closer, Devin Williams, struggled in the ninth against his former team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the third season of a six-year, $162 million deal, Rodon (1-0) allowed one run on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out seven and walked two in his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee's Freddy Peralta (0-1) allowed two runs on four hits in five innings during his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleswhere, Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hernandez and Tommy Edman hit home runs, Blake Snell went five strong innings and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers capped a day of celebration with a 5-4 victory over the visiting Detroit Tigers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Dodgers debut, the free-agent addition Snell (1-0) gave up two runs on five hits over five innings with two strikeouts. The two-time Cy Young Award winner was able to work around four walks. Blake Treinen pitched a scoreless ninth for his first save.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit his second home run in the third game of the season as the Dodgers played at home for the first time since a victory in Game 2 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Framber Valdez tossed seven shutout innings and the new-look Astros claimed a 3-1 victory over the visiting New York Mets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valdez (1-0) became the first left-hander in franchise history to make four consecutive Opening Day starts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scattered four hits, issued two walks and recorded four strikeouts, seemingly strengthening as he worked deeper into his outing. Valdez tossed 90 pitches, 56 for strikes. (Reuters)

    Trump pulls UN envoy nomination amid Congress fears

<img alt="Donald Trump with US Representative Elise Stefanik last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797812_1_20250328104043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump withdrew right-wing firebrand Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations as Republicans fear for their narrow majority in Congress.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York congresswoman is just the second Trump cabinet pick not to go through, after Matt Gaetz pulled out of the running to be attorney general following allegations of sexual misconduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik is a vocal Trump ally and pro-Israel stalwart.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat" in the House of Representatives, Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said it was "essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had asked Stefanik to stay in Congress and "rejoin the House leadership team," although he did not say in what capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans won both the House and Senate in the November 2024 election that returned Trump to the White House, but they have a very tight lead in the lower chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They control the House by 218 seats to 213, giving them just a tiny margin and making it difficult to pass key legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two crucial special elections will be held in Florida on April 1 to fill the seats vacated by Mike Waltz, who is now Trump's national security advisor, and Gaetz.
  <br>
  <br>
  While both Republicans comfortably won the seats in November, polling in one of the districts has shown the Democratic candidate closing the gap considerably.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has leaned into the races, with an appearance Thursday at a candidate's online event seen as evidence that Republicans are worried.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those concerns were further heightened on Tuesday, when a special election for Pennsylvania's state senate saw Democrats flip a district that Trump won handily last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik has effectively been in limbo since Trump's nomination, keeping her place in the House for a number of key votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A firebrand who was considered a moderate before the Trump era, Stefanik is seen as one of the most vocal supporters in Congress of both Israel and US Jewish causes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic turned on the style to take his place in the last four of the Miami Open with an impressive 6-3, 7-6 win over American Sebastian Korda, becoming the oldest man to reach a Masters 1000 semi-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb made a strong start against Korda, breaking early to get a first set advantage that he never let slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Korda showed great resilience in the second set, taking the contest to a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the fourth-seed Djokovic, looking for his seventh Miami Open title but first since 2016, again came up strong, sealing the win with a powerful ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on Friday, had no doubt what had been the key to his success, after winning 84 per cent of his first-serve points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One word, serve. I was serving very well, probably the best serving performance, not just here, but in a long time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Czech teenager Jakub Mensik marched into his first Masters semi when he defeated France's Arthur Fils 7-6, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils had enjoyed one of the biggest wins of his career on Wednesday when he defeated top-seed Alexander Zverev, but he struggled to repeat the feat against the impressive 19-year-old Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech will next face American third seed Taylor Fritz, who came through an enthralling battle with Italian Matteo Berrettini with a 7-5, 6-7, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini looked buried in the second set tie-break when he trailed 6-3 but his booming serve and some incredible returns gave him the opportunity of a deciding set. In total, Berrettini saved six match points in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was nip and tuck with the pair on serve until Fritz, working hard on the baseline, broke to go 6-5 up and then held on for the win. (AFP)

<img alt="The NBA said the four-team mini-tournament for this year's All-Star Game will be scrapped. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797807_1_20250328094751.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 It's unclear what next year's NBA All-Star Game will look like, but commissioner Adam Silver said the league is "a bit back to the drawing board" as it moves away from the three-game mini-tournament that was implemented this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday following a board of governors meeting, Silver said the league will look for ways to improve the mid-season event, which this year drew 4.7 million viewers across TNT platforms - down 13 percent from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only NBA All-Star Game with fewer viewers came in 2023, with 4.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought we made almost an immeasurable amount of progress," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought this was a little better, but it was a miss. We're not there in terms of creating an All-Star experience that we can be proud of, that our players can be proud of."
  <br>
  <br>
  This season's format featured four teams competing in a three-game mini-tournament, with 24 All-Stars divided among three teams in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth team was the Rising Stars event winner, which was held two nights before the All-Star Game. Four-time NBA MVP LeBron James, a late scratch, was not among the participants. Anthony Edwards also scratched.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We recalibrated around this year's All-Star game in San Francisco, around more of an entertainment product, and I don't think it worked," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The breaks were too long. And I get it: It was an opportunity to celebrate TNT, as they were gonna have their last All-Star Game. It was well-intentioned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's All-Star Game will be broadcast on NBC, which takes over following a 23-year run by TNT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that despite the success of the NHL's Four Nations Face-Off, the NBA doesn't appear to be set on adding a USA vs. World format for next year's All-Star Game in Inglewood, California, which will be the new home of the Los Angeles Clippers. (Reuters)

    Light rain aids firefighters in South Korea

<div class="itemFullText">
 Light rain offered some relief to South Korean authorities tackling the country's worst wildfires on record, with exhausted firefighters making another push on Friday to contain blazes stretching 70 km.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 28 people have died and more than 45,000 hectares of largely forest land in the country's southeast have been charred or are burning, as strong winds have driven blazes from central Uiseong county to coastal regions over the past week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uiseong reported fires had been put out in 95 percent of the area as of early Friday, and flames in 85 percent of the neighbouring Andong city, which is home to UNESCO World Heritage sites, have been doused, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeongdeok county on the east coast, where the fire spread from the initial blaze more than 70 km away in under 12 hours, was still fighting to contain the flames, with nearly a third of the area still ablaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain of less than 3 mm fell in some parts of the regions on Thursday and had offered "a little help," forest service spokesman Kim Jong-gun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and helicopters were taking advantage of more favourable weather and better visibility to make a push to make more progress before winds are expected to pick up later on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes that began in Uiseong have become the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history, destroying an area equivalent to about two-thirds of the island of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 80 helicopters started flying at daybreak on Friday to dump water, the safety ministry said. A helicopter pilot died on Wednesday after crashing while trying to tackle a blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires have displaced more than 30,000 residents, many of whom are elderly, and ravaged everything in their path, including historic temples and homes, in the mountainous forest regions of North Gyeongsang province. (Reuters)

    Government strongly condemns UK report on HK

<img alt='The SAR government urged the UK to "respect international law" and "immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters." File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797769_1_20250328093204.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly disapproved of and must resolutely refute the untruthful remarks, slanders and smears against various aspects of the SAR in the UK's six-monthly report on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns and rejects the UK's attempt through a so-called six-monthly report to make misleading and irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong matters, wantonly put politics above the rule of law and attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance by despicable political manoeuvres," a government statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It urged the UK to discern facts from fallacies, respect international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, pointing out that the Sino-British Joint Declaration did not authorise the UK to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs after its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also rejected UK criticism that laws safeguarding national security in the SAR had eroded rights and freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With at least 14 pieces of laws safeguarding national security in the UK, those remarks by the UK are not only totally distorting and confounding right and wrong, but they also entirely disregard the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government statement highlighted Hong Kong's number one ranking in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, among 165 economies. It said it was evident that international funds and investments were confident in Hong Kong's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman stressed that "the rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time", while human rights in the city have always been guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law.

    Arctic sea ice hits record low, says US agency

<img alt="A polar bear is seen on ice floes in the Franz Josef Land archipelago in 2021. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797792_1_20250328084339.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arctic sea ice had its weakest winter buildup since record-keeping began 47 years ago, a symptom of climate change that will have repercussions globally, scientists said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Arctic reaches its maximum sea ice in March each year and then starts a six-month melt season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Snow and Ice Data Centre said the peak measurement taken on Saturday was 14.33 million square kilometres - about 80,000 square kilometres smaller than the lowest previous peak in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Warming temperatures are what’s causing the ice to decline,'' ice data scientist Walt Meier said. “You know, sea ice in particular is very sensitive... 31 degrees is ice skating and 33 degrees it’s swimming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists said warming conditions in the Arctic - the region is warming four times faster than the rest of the world - affect weather elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The warming winter atmosphere above the Arctic Circle does impact large-scale weather patterns that do influence those of us outside the Arctic,” said Julienne Stroeve, an ice scientist at the University of Manitoba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the smaller sea ice, Stroeve noted that not only was there less of it, the remaining ice was thin enough for more of it to melt quickly this summer. She cautioned that a record low area in the winter didn't guarantee a record small area in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Melting Arctic sea ice - mostly in the summer - is making the polar bear population smaller, weaker and hungrier because they rely on the sea ice to hunt from, scientists said. And winter sea ice is especially important for fisheries and seal pups, Meier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic sea ice's biggest year since record-keeping began was 1979, at 16.64 million square kilometres. That means since satellites began tracking it, Arctic sea ice's winter peak has shrunk by about the size of Pakistan. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s men’s basketball team have made history by qualifying for the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup for the first time ever, while their teammates from the women’s team representing Hong Kong, China fell just short of doing the same.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad of Chan Wing-hei, Lam Chun-tat, Tsoi Lung-tak and Wong Ho-yin fought their way into the tournament by topping their qualifying group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They beat Bahrain, Guam and Malaysia in the process, and a one-point loss to Indonesia didn’t stop them from becoming one of twelve teams making the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the first time the SAR progressed to the main draw in eight tries, since the competition made its debut 12 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team will play hosts Singapore on Saturday afternoon and Mongolia at night, as they look to advance further in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China's women's team would've also qualified for the Cup for the first time - but they dropped the final do-or-die game against Chinese Taipei, 17-19.
