<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda enthusiasts gathered at Ocean Park on Sunday to get a sight of An An and Ke Ke, as the two pandas gifted by Beijing made their public debut today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kamy Yeung, who has been following the news about the animals, told RTHK that it is a great day to give the pandas a big welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I happen to be seeing them eating breakfast in the morning... and it’s quite nice to see them being lively and smiley. It’s nice to see all the enthusiasm from everyone around the world to celebrate the joy at the park,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore tourist Rachel Wang spent around HK$1,100 on panda souvenirs. She said she finds An An adorable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s so active, but having seen the pandas, I think Ke Ke is very demure and very loveable. I’m really excited and I love pandas to start with... actually I want to be a panda as well after seeing them,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Mezzatesta from the United States said he woke up early just to see the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I like the girl panda a little bit more, she seemed a little bit more shy, very cute to see her get all nervous seeing a bunch of people. We queued up at around 9am. I was very excited to see the pandas. I woke up at six in the morning ready to go to Ocean Park to see the pandas,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park has implemented dispersion measures, in which around 100 tickets are given out every 15 minutes. Each visitor is only allowed to stay in the area for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the debut of An An and Ke Ke, the new panda twins will greet the public in the first quarter next year.

    'No worries over undersubscribed bonds'

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong offers many investment options with the market being vibrant. Photo courtesy of Commercial Radio" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782578_1_20241208121735.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The finance chief on Sunday said there is no need for concern after the latest offering of retail infrastructure bonds, totalling HK$20 billion, fell short of its target.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 128,000 investors signed up for the bonds during the offering period that ended on Friday, with the final issuance size expected to be around HK$17.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said people should not worry about the undersubscription of the latest round of bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Institutional investors have oversubscribed for the bonds by three or four times, so we don't have to worry about the amount raised from bonds this year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently there are many investment options. We can also see that in future, many high-quality companies will come to Hong Kong to list, so the investment market will be vibrant."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government previously told lawmakers that it had doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, from its forecast of a little more than HK$48 billion announced in February's budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said it might take some time for the government to achieve a fiscal balance, but cautioned the process should not be done too quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it will take several years to achieve a fiscal balance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've spoken to credit rating agencies and they agreed that major economies have been experiencing financial deficits during the pandemic. They're against achieving a fiscal balance aggressively and within a short period of time, such as one or two years, by significantly cutting spending. This would not only hurt people's livelihoods, but would also cause the economy to contract, which is counterproductive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance chief said on his weekly blog that the government is committed to coordinating different mega events to "achieve maximum synergy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Hong Kong has held a number of fashion and design events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said designers and entrepreneurs from all over the world that have come to Hong Kong for large-scale international arts and culture events "highly recognised" the capability of the SAR in curating and coordinating such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking part in events in the city allows people in the arts and creative industries to more easily reach out to potential partners, Chan added.

    Govt mulling rewards for exposing future poor SDUs

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials will see whether a reward system for tipping off authorities about poor quality sub-divided flats will be needed in future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing chief Winnie Ho said officials could reward informants who alert authorities to poor quality sub-divided units (SDUs), when the flats are subject to a future regulatory regime.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is now collecting public views on its proposal to require each SDU to be no less than less than eight square metres in size, or 86 square feet, as well as having features like at least one window and an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials propose that landlords who violate the requirements in future could be subject to a maximum three-year jail term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the reward system might be needed to dig out "hidden" sub-standard flats, but she stressed officials are also gauging public views over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the public has seen the proposed standards and finds them reasonable, and she described the penalty as rather heavy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that everyone won't have to wait until informant and reward systems - that everyone agrees to follow the new rules, register the flats," she said on a TVB programme that aired on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll see how effective the new system is - and we'll see if we need to offer rewards, in addition to the regular reporting system."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints so far from sub-divided flat tenants who said they were forced out by landlords because of the proposed regime, and officials will handle different complaints regarding rental issues.

<img alt='Residents cheer as they gather on a street in Damascus. Rebels said that President Bashar al-Assad had fled the country, calling on citizens abroad to return to a "free Syria".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Syrian government appeared to have fallen early Sunday in a stunning end to the 50-year rule of the Assad family after a lightning rebel offensive.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said President Bashar al-Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus after a stunning advance across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to “extend its hand” to the opposition and hand over its functions to a transitional government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,” Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not address reports that Assad had left the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  State television in Iran, Assad’s main backer in the years of war in Syria, reported that Assad had left the capital. It cited Qatar’s Al Jazeera news network for the information and did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government on the reports of Assad's departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the leader of Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ordered forces on Sunday not to approach official institutions in Damascus, saying they would remain under the prime minister until they are "officially" handed over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former prime minister until they are officially handed over," Jolani said in a statement on Telegram, using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa instead of his nom de guerre, and adding: "It is forbidden to shoot into the air."

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early departure, the leader of Yoon's ruling party said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon made the comments during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, after Yoon survived an impeachment vote in the opposition-led parliament late on Saturday over his brief imposition of martial law last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's future remained uncertain on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A boycott by Yoon's party killed off the impeachment motion late on Saturday even as huge crowds braved freezing temperatures outside parliament to demand his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the deeply unpopular president's survival may be short-lived, with Yoon's People Power Party saying it had "effectively obtained (Yoon's) promise to step down".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the president steps down, the president will be effectively excluded from his duties," it said in a statement. (Agencies)

<img alt="Syrian rebels led by HTS have intensified their offensive, capturing Damascus and seizing control of key areas in Aleppo and Hama.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syrian rebels said they have seized control of the capital Damascus with reports suggesting that President Bashar al-Assad had boarded a plane and left the country for an unknown destination on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting "Freedom", witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison," said the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, rebels announced they had gained full control of the key city of Homs after only a day of fighting, leaving Assad's 24-year rule dangling by a thread.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intense sounds of shooting were heard in the centre of the Damascus, residents said on Sunday, although it was not immediately clear what the source of the shooting was.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against Assad's rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting "Assad is gone, Homs is free" and "Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syria's strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homs' capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movement's dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm "those who drop their arms".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early on Sunday that operations were ongoing to "completely liberate" the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Syrian army said it was reinforcing around Damascus, and state television reported on Saturday that Assad remained in the city. (Reuters)

<img alt="South Korea's defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun stepped down as South Korea's defence minister after the brief suspension of civilian rule. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782564_1_20241208093453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister was arrested on Sunday, local media reported, a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over his calamitous attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed due to a boycott of the vote by Yoon's party, even though huge crowds braved freezing temperatures in another night of protests outside parliament in Seoul to demand the president's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun had already resigned as defence minister after the brief suspension of civilian rule late on Tuesday by Yoon that saw soldiers and helicopters sent to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was forced to rescind the order hours later and parliament voted down his decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had already been slapped with a travel ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have launched an investigation into Yoon, Kim and others for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office was not immediately available for comment on Kim's arrest, reported by the Yonhap news agency and other local media outlets on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties proposed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes in the 300-member parliament to pass, but a near-total boycott by Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) doomed it to failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP said after the vote that it had blocked the impeachment to avoid "severe division and chaos", adding that it would "resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner".
  <br>
  <br>
  Party leader Han Dong-hoon said that the party had "effectively obtained" Yoon's promise to step down, and said until this happened he would "be effectively excluded from his duties", leaving the prime minister and party to manage state affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The failure of the impeachment motion came as a huge blow to the massive crowds -- numbering 150,000 according to police, one million according to organisers -- demonstrating outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik called the PPP's walkout "a failure to engage in the democratic process" on the part of the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though we didn't get the outcome we wanted today, I am neither discouraged nor disappointed because we will get it eventually," protester Jo Ah-gyeong, 30, said on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job," a disappointed Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said "I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fought incredible. We came back twice," said Guardiola. "We gave everything and we take a point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed City are eight points behind Liverpool and a fifth straight Premier League title is looking increasingly unlikely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final league derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park will be rescheduled after Storm Darragh battered western regions of England with high winds and heavy rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford enjoy the best home record in the division and made it seven wins from eight games at the Gtech Community Stadium with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo, who has been linked with a move to the Magpies, opened the scoring with a sensational individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle quickly levelled twice in the first half through Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes, either side of Yoane Wissa's second for Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calamitous defending cost Newcastle in the second period when Nathan Collins prodded home from goalkeeper Mark Flekken's long ball forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade then sealed the points for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are growing, a lot of the players here for a while have taken another step up," said Brentford boss Thomas Frank, whose team are seventh in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to carry on this home form but some wins on the road would be welcome too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 1-0 thanks to Jhon Duran's goal in his first Premier League start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's postponement means Arsenal and Chelsea have the chance the cut the gap at the top to four points later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners travel to Fulham while Chelsea are at Tottenham. (AFP)

    Notre Dame re-opens five years after fire

<img alt="Guests stand during a ceremony to mark the re-opening of the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral, in central Paris. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782553_1_20241208032450.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The archbishop of Paris re-opened Notre Dame cathedral on Saturday by symbolically knocking on the doors and entering the 12th-century landmark which has been restored after a devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wearing new designer vestments and carrying a staff cut from one of the roof beams that survived the inferno, Laurent Ulrich joined hundreds of VIPs inside the Gothic masterpiece for a two-hour ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ulrich commanded the cathedral to "open your doors" and he entered the magnificently-restored edifice.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump sat on the front row as guest of honour next to French President Emmanuel Macron, with invitees marvelling at the freshly cleaned walls, new furniture and state-of-the-art lightening installed as part of the cathedral's overhaul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other dignitaries in attendance included outgoing US first lady Jill Biden and Prince William.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, small crowds of Parisians and tourists braved wet weather and high winds to witness the renaissance of a beloved monument which came close to being totally destroyed by the inferno that toppled its roof and spire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reconstruction effort has cost around US$750 million, financed from donations, with the re-opening achieved within a five-year deadline set by Macron despite predictions it could take decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers had to overcome problems with lead pollution, the Covid-19 epidemic, and the army general overseeing the project falling to his death while hiking in the Pyrenees last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is "a cathedral like we have never seen before," Philippe Jost, who took over as project manager last year, told Franceinfo radio, adding that he was proud to "show the whole world" a "great collective success and a source of pride for all of France".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's service featured prayer, organ music and hymns from the cathedral's choir.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public concert planned in front of the cathedral featuring Chinese piano virtuoso Lang Lang and possibly US singer and fashion designer Pharrell Williams had to be pre-recorded on Friday night because of the stormy weather. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday said that the world was "a little crazy" as he met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris ahead of the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral on his first international trip since his re-election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two men embraced and shook hands several times on the steps of the French presidential palace, with Trump given a full guard of honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems like the world is going a little crazy right now and we will be talking about that," Trump told reporters as he prepared to sit down for talks with Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite tensions between the two men during his first term, Trump hailed his ties with the centrist French leader, saying, "We had a great relationship as everyone knows. We accomplished a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron told Trump it was "a great honour for French people to welcome you" for the re-opening ceremony at Notre Dame, which was devastated by a blaze in 2019 during Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You were president at that time and I remember the solidarity and the immediate reaction," Macron added, speaking in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he first took office in 2017, Trump's ties with Macron, then also a fresh face on the world stage, began warmly despite some political differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the Elysee Palace soon after and the trio posed for pictures before commencing talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  They held trilateral talks on topics including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as trade. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US national champion Amber Glenn stunned three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto to win women's gold ahead of five Japanese figure skaters at the ISU Grand Prix final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Glenn extended her lead from the short programme in the free skating final in south-eastern France, scoring a total of 212.07 points after two performances which both included her signature triple axel jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite six-skater competition included five Japanese skaters with Mone Chiba taking silver with 208.85 points and defending champion Sakamoto bronze with 201.13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sakamoto had not been beaten in a major competition since the 2022 Grand Prix final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Olympic bronze medallist paid for a fall on a triple toeloop which cost her points in the short programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Glenn, 25, who won both her Grand Prix events in Angers, France and China this year, had not won an international event before this season and steps into the spotlight just over a year ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  She becomes the first American woman to win the Grand Prix final, the third major event in the skating calendar after the Olympics and world championships, since Alissa Czisny in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, German figure skaters Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin successfully defended their pairs title. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Ding Liren and his teenage challenger Gukesh Dommaraju of India remained even on Saturday with only four games to go in their World Chess Championship match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The score is deadlocked at five points each after 10 games in the 14-match series as both agreed to a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each player has won one game apiece, with Ding taking the opening match on November 25 and Guksesh coming back to defeat the champion in game three. The rest ended in draws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, 32, gained an early advantage on Saturday playing with the white pieces but the game soon fizzled to a draw as neither player made any inroads after 36 moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the tournament neared the homestretch, both players admitted that each move will be crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the cost of one game is higher than it was maybe ... a few games before," the 18-year-old Gukesh said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But my approach and my goal is still the same: to play good games in every single game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding said "there's not so much room to make mistakes" anymore and every loss "will result in a very bad situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  If both remain tied after 14 rounds, the match will move to a tie-breaker, which will be played on December 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding beat Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi last year to become the world champion in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his age, Gukesh is the youngest player in history to compete in the World Championship and he is looking to surpass Garry Kasparov as the youngest undisputed world chess champion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An opposition-led motion to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol over his brief declaration of martial law failed on Saturday as it did not meet the required quorum after his party boycotted the vote.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a total of 195 votes, the number of members who voted did not reach the required two-thirds majority of the total members. Therefore, I declare that the vote on this matter is not valid," National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which hold 192 seats in the 300-seat parliament, earlier filed the impeachment motion, which needed 200 votes to pass and went to the vote on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  But almost all 108 members of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) filed out of the chamber before the vote, prompting critical shouts from the opposition -- with one yelling "Where are you going?" and others calling them "accomplices to insurrection".
  <br>
  <br>
  Only three PPP members cast ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, nearly 150,000 people were estimated by police to have filled the streets around the National Assembly, demanding that lawmakers impeach Yoon for his sudden imposition of martial law four days earlier, which plunged South Korea into turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  For hours, people poured into the area around parliament where on Tuesday night soldiers were helicoptered in as part of Yoon's short-lived bid to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the vote, Yoon, 63, apologised for the turmoil but said he would leave it to his party to decide his fate. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Many of the tens of thousands of protesters outside South Korea's parliament were overcome with emotion on Saturday, as a presidential impeachment motion against President Yoon Suk Yeol looked set to fail.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the plenary session got under way in South Korea’s national assembly, some members of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) walked out of the chamber after voting on the special counsel appointment in the first lady’s case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, some ruling PPP lawmakers returned to cast their votes, telling reporters they voted against the impeachment and that they returned to vote because it was "important".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 people were estimated by police to have filled the streets around the National Assembly on Saturday, demanding that lawmakers impeach Yoon for his sudden imposition of martial law four days earlier, which plunged South Korea into turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  For hours, people poured into the area around parliament where on Tuesday night soldiers were helicoptered in as part of Yoon's short-lived bid to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the vote on the opposition-led impeachment motion, giant screens to show parliament livefeeds were set up across the eight-lane road by the National Assembly, which had been closed off to serve as a rally site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the event that the impeachment vote is passed, Yoon would be immediately suspended and replaced as president by the prime minister, Han Duck-soo. It would then be left to the Constitutional court to decide whether to uphold the national assembly’s vote. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people across the UK were left without power on Saturday morning after Storm Darragh hit the country with strong winds and caused pre-Christmas travel disruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The UK's Met Office had issued a rare red alert for high winds overnight to Saturday morning (0300 to 1100 GMT) covering parts of Wales and southwest England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government warned three million people living in the area with a siren-like alert on their phones to stay at home on Friday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the storm posed a "challenging situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  "About three million homes will have had the emergency alert system on their mobile phone. I would just encourage anyone who has had that to follow the advice," Reynolds told Sky News on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season, is also expected to bring heavy rain through the weekend, with more than 100 flood warnings and alerts in place across the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wales, the Met Office estimated gusts of up to 150 kmh, which knocked out power for over 50,000 people, according to the PA news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power cuts affected 86,000 homes in England, Scotland and Wales, according to the Energy Networks Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  Network Rail Wales suspended trains on the Welsh northern coast due to a "fallen tree blocking the line," and several bridges in southern England and Wales were closed for safety reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate amber warning, which is less serious than the red alert but still poses a "potential risk to life and property," covering a larger stretch of the UK and Northern Ireland is in place until Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Ireland, thousands were left without power, and several bus and train services were suspended or delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christmas markets and sporting events were postponed, including the Merseyside derby between Premier League leaders Liverpool and Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Ireland, which issued an "orange" wind warning, 400,000 people were left without electricity, according to the RTE news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dublin Airport said "A number of flights scheduled for Saturday morning have been cancelled by airlines" due to the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darragh comes two weeks after Storm Bert battered much of Britain, causing "devastating" flooding in parts of Wales and knocking out power to thousands of homes in Ireland. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A three-storey apartment block in The Hague partially collapsed on Saturday after a fire and explosion, firefighters said, with first responders searching for people under the rubble.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auhtorities said at least three people have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several people have already been pulled out of the debris and taken to hospital, as elite teams with sniffer dogs deployed to rescue others trapped by the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not known how many people were still missing nor what caused the explosion in the block of flats not far from the centre of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still don't know how many people might be under the rubble," said a police officer on-site.
  <br>
  <br>
  A witness at the scene saw dozens of fire trucks as firefighters battled the blaze from the ground and from higher positions. Police helicopters circled overhead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Debris was strewn across the street and several windows had been blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huge plumes of smoke were billowing from a large hole where the building stood, with an acrid smell in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was asleep and suddenly there was this huge bang," Adam Muller, said one 14-year-old local resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked out of the window and just saw flames. It's a massive shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities warned locals to keep their windows shut and shut off ventilation systems due to the smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forensic investigators arrived on the scene to begin to probe a potential cause for the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several homes appeared to have been destroyed by the fire, which broke out around 6:15 am (0515 GMT), according to the emergency services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three floors of the building consisted of shops on the ground floors and five two-storey apartments, authorities said, with living rooms on the second floor and bedrooms on the top. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool's Merseyside derby trip to Everton on Saturday was postponed due to adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Darragh.
 <br>
  <br>
  High winds and heavy rain have battered western parts of the United Kingdom, causing widespread travel disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Everton said the fixture had been postponed on safety grounds following a meeting between both clubs, local police and Liverpool City Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst we appreciate this will be deeply disappointing for supporters, the safety of fans, staff and players is of paramount importance," Everton's statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fixture will be the final Merseyside derby in the league at Everton's Goodison Park, home to the club since 1892, before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead the Premier League by seven points after 14 games of the 38-match season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fixtures in England's second tier Championship in Plymouth and Cardiff were postponed on Friday due to a rare red weather warning issued by the MET office, the UK's national weather service, for south-west England and Wales. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The two giant pandas gifted to Hong Kong by the central government will retain their original names, An An and Ke Ke, which symbolise peace, stability, and endless possibilities for the future of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government and Ocean Park organised a naming competition in October for these national treasures, and received over 22,600 suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park on Saturday, it was announced that the judges had selected the suggestion to keep the original names of the five-year-old pandas, as the Chinese pronunciation of "An" and "Ke" together resembles the word "encore," symbolising ongoing good fortune for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it is so meaningful. There is more of a sense of belonging by keeping their original names," said a woman surnamed To.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Li said she fears people might confuse the new An An with the previous panda of the same name, who passed away in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's fine, but some people might think of the old An An. That An An lived in Hong Kong for a very long time, so we were really sad when he passed away. It should be fine to reuse the name because the new panda is used to this name anyway. It should help him adjust a lot easier," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his speech at the ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said he is ecstatic for the pair to officially meet the public on Sunday, adding that the pandas will serve as tourism ambassadors for both the nation and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This initiative aims to create a panda craze across the city and bring giant pandas to different corners of Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will continue to seize the opportunities presented by the giant pandas, actively collaborating with various sectors to organise more related activities and launch locally themed panda products, providing visitors with a unique panda experience and boosting Hong Kong's tourism and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said that the giant pandas exemplify the nation's successful conservation efforts, and he affirmed that the SAR is dedicated to collaborating with experts from the mainland to advance panda conservation initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will work with Ocean Park to advance panda conservation and outreach efforts. Various educational activities will be organised to allow more friends from both local and international communities to learn about the achievements and strengths of the nation and Hong Kong in conservation, reversing the trends of species extinction, and promoting biodiversity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the mainland, with a total of six, including also Ying Ying, Le Le and their newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, many people also gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui to take photos with the 2,500 giant panda sculptures in the first stop of the "Panda Go! Fest HK" exhibition.

    'Tai Lam Tunnel fee adjustment plans are balanced'

File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782506_1_20241207155511.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New transport chief Mable Chan said on Saturday that further fee reductions at the Tai Lam Tunnel are not possible, as additional vehicle flow will lead to congestion during peak hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, she said the bureau is actively improving transport facilities that connect to the tunnel, to ensure the takeover can be executed smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Thursday it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for commercial vehicles – tolls are down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the time-varying tolls, in which vehicles will pay different fees according to "peak", "normal" and "non-peak" hours, mean the fees for all vehicle types will be largely reduced, with "non-peak" hour fees set at the lowest possible price.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Road pricing is an important transport management measure to regulate vehicular flow. Tai Lam Tunnel, including its control areas, is 10 kilometres long, which is the length of five Tsing Ma Bridges. The maintenance cost is not low," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tunnels are an important asset of the government. We have to abide by our strict fiscal discipline, and uphold the users pay principle," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the plans will help the tunnel reach its full capacity.

    Pokémon Go trainers embark on city safari in HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pokémon enthusiasts from around the world are in Hong Kong for the city's inaugural "Pokémon Go City Safari" event, where the popular mobile app will take users to landmarks and historic places in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Niantic, the game's creators, said the two-day event that started on Saturday is meant to immerse both locals and tourists in the city's rich culture and architecture, while enjoying the augmented reality game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Broadwell, from Sweden, has been playing the game since 2019, and she said these events are ideal for those who enjoy discovering new cities in unique and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like the walk and catch aspect of Pokémon Go so this event seemed perfect to able to walk around, see things and just be walking and catching and seeing the sites as I go along. It fits my style of playing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still a bit jet-lagged. We came from America, came from Las Vegas. It was a 15 and a half hours flight, so we're still trying to get our bearings of where we are or what we are doing," said Jim Haughey, who often travels for these events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elaine Hui, director of APAC regional marketing at Niantic, said Hong Kong's unique qualities made it stand out when they were selecting a venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to find a city that is really easy to travel, and I think Hong Kong has that quality. On the other hand, we want to have something special for this city, and Hong Kong has that quality, too," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have East and West. They have very new, tall buildings, very iconic buildings, but they also have neighbourhoods, which are a little bit older, but with a lot of history. That's why we think Hong Kong is a good place."

    Subdivided tenants' rights protected by law: minister

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is not yet finalised. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782497_1_20241207130131.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Saturday the Rating and Valuation Department has received two complaints of landlords forcing tenants of subdivided units to move out so they can be renovated to meet government requirements.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his policy address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with so-called "basic housing units". These must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Ho said tenants' rights are protected under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenant's security of tenure is protected. The tenancy contract is regulated for two years plus an additional two years. If water and electricity bills are separate, landlords are not allowed to overcharge for them. The tenant's fees for these services cannot be higher than the service charges that the landlord pays to water and electricity companies," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho stressed that the basic housing unit policy is still under consultation, and further adjustments may be made before the bill is tabled at the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Ho said the decision to have the South Island Line (West) adopt the smart transit system cut six years from the construction time, allowing the government to advance the redevelopment of Wah Fu public housing estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government announced on Friday that the estate's last remaining residents now have to leave by 2034/35, six years ahead of schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday the transport chief announced that the railway will use the Smart and Green Mass Transit System, rather than an underground heavy rail system. The green system, which runs above ground, will save almost six years," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We originally set aside land in the estate for an underground station... and could only move residents after the station was built. But now that land is freed up, and we can put up buildings immediately, speeding up the redevelopment," she added.

  <br>
  The government announcement also laid out clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate. Residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said redevelopment decisions are made according to the condition of the estate and its urgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the government is yet to discuss building heights, plot ratios and road networks of the redeveloped Choi Hung estate.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's new transport minister vowed on Saturday to ensure that the new Kai Tak Sports Park's transport links is capable of meeting every possible eventuality.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arena and sports ground will host a stress test involving 12,000 people on Sunday as the bureau assesses the facility's readiness for large events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Mable Chan, who took office on Thursday, said the tests are intended to ensure that the preparation work at the park is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from us, the various transport operators including the MTR, buses, and taxis will be involved. We hope that through the various stress tests, we will step up our mobilisation, our preparation, and make ourselves better prepared for different scenarios," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So when the sports park is commissioned, we will have a better and holistic preparation to cater for different scenarios, and give our best to make this (a) success and give the best service to locals and visitors," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the bureau will adopt a two-pronged approach to meet the public's expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it would adopt new technologies and would also strive to have an innovative mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the contractor for the Northern Link project will be finalised next year - depending on the final arrangements and designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the "smart and green" mass transit system to be used in Kai Tak and East Kowloon, Chan said the bureau had received more than 30 expressions of interest from local, mainland and overseas companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government will hold a tender next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that the new system can serve as a medium capacity transport linking the public with conventional rail systems, even though it won't have the passenger capacity of traditional heavy networks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the government will monitor fare levels for the new systems.

    Yoon Suk Yeol apologises over martial law attempt

<img alt="South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol bows while addressing the nation at the Presidential Office in Seoul. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782484_1_20241207100836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol stopped short of resigning on Saturday over his declaration of martial law, with a vote to impeach him hours away and mass street protests planned in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon stunned the nation and the international community on Tuesday night by imposing martial law for the first time since the 1980s and deploying troops and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmakers managed to vote down the decree, forcing Yoon to rescind the order in the early hours of Wednesday in a night of extraordinary drama for a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The declaration of martial law arose from my urgency as the president," he said in a televised address, the first time he has appeared before the public since plunging the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, in the process, I caused anxiety and inconvenience to the public. I sincerely apologize to the citizens who were greatly distressed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition and even key members of his own party have called for him to step down, and parliament is set to vote later Saturday on his impeachment, although the opposition leader has said it's not clear if the motion can pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have said they expect tens of thousands of anti-Yoon protestors to take to the streets ahead of the vote, with organisers hoping 200,000 people will attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon did not offer to resign in his brief address, saying only that he would "entrust the party with measures to stabilise the political situation, including my term in office."
  <br>
  <br>
  His party is divided on the issue, with lawmakers on Friday sticking to the official line that they would block impeachment, even after party head Han Dong-hoon said Yoon must go or Seoul risked more political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The normal performance of the president's duties is impossible under the (current) circumstances, and an early resignation of the president is inevitable," Han Dong-hoon told reporters early on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition bloc holds 192 seats in the 300-strong parliament, while Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) has 108.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just eight ruling party lawmakers need to defect for the vote to get the two-thirds majority it needs to pass. One PPP lawmaker has already publicly said they will vote with the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A successful vote would suspend Yoon from office pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have begun investigating Yoon and others for alleged insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not shy away from the issue of legal and political responsibility regarding the declaration of martial law," Yoon said during his address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday night, at least 15,000 anti-Yoon protesters braved the cold weather to gather in Seoul's Yeouido district, where the National Assembly is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some camped out all night despite freezing temperatures while opposition MPs remained in parliament, fearing Yoon might try some desperate measure to remain in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  An opinion poll released Friday put backing for the 63-year-old president at a record low of 13 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq and the S&P hit fresh records on Friday after the November US jobs report came in better than expected, with the Dow edging down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, up from a revised 36,000 in October, according to the Department of Labor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of being viewed as a Goldilocks jobs print," Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jobs market is cooling, there's no question about that, but it's still relatively healthy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower, shedding 0.3 percent to close at 44,642.52.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P rose 0.3 percent to close at a new record of 6,090.27, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 percent to finish at a fresh high of 19,859.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a good day for tech titans, with Amazon and Facebook owner Meta closing up 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  UnitedHealthcare's shares fell 5.1 percent after the markets digested the news that its chief executive had been killed in a shooting in New York in the early hours of Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Mary Jane Veloso had been set to face the firing squad in 2015. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782442_1_20241206205203.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Filipina on death row in Indonesia could be home before Christmas after Manila and Jakarta signed an agreement to repatriate her, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mother of two Mary Jane Veloso was arrested in 2010 after the suitcase she was carrying was found to be lined with 2.6 kilogrammes of heroin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters claim she was duped by an international drug syndicate, and in 2015, she narrowly escaped execution after her suspected recruiter was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree to return the person concerned to the Philippines," Indonesia's senior law and human rights minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters after signing a "practical arrangement" for Veloso's repatriation in Jakarta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mary Jane Veloso becomes the responsibility of the Philippines," he said, adding that he had heard that the death penalty would be changed to life imprisonment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusril said the transfer could be carried out "before Christmas."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe around December 20 it can be realised."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's mother said she was "elated and surprised" to hear of her daughter's homecoming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can finally be together this Christmas," Celia Veloso, 65, said. "This might be the happiest Christmas we will ever have as a family."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's case sparked uproar in the Philippines, with rallies of support and world boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao pleading for her life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters said she was headed to work as a maid when she was arrested in Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was due to face the firing squad in 2015 but the Philippine government won a last-minute reprieve for her after a woman suspected of recruiting her was arrested and put on trial for human trafficking and Veloso was named as a prosecution witness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines' Department of Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez expressed "heartfelt gratitude" over Veloso's repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hopeful that we will be able to do this before Christmas so that it will be a happier Christmas for everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Velosos have "long been wanting to see their family back and hold her in their arms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vasquez said Veloso would serve her sentence "as agreed upon, in accordance with Philippine laws."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do understand and we respect the decision of the Indonesian courts with respect to the sentence that was meted out to our citizen Mary Jane Veloso," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The No. 3 alarm fire in Aberdeen was put out at 8.55pm on Friday, almost five hours after it started.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the blaze broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at 4.11pm, and was upgraded to a No. 3 alarm around 30 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters pointed out that because many of the vessels under repair at the shipyard were fibreglass boats, that exacerbated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the sheer size of the shipyard also made it difficult to bring the fire under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 220 firefighters and rescue workers were brought in to fight the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four fire boat monitors, four jets and breathing apparatus teams were also deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  61 people had to be evacuated, but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Lau, who owns a shipyard in the area, said she suffered major losses as a result of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am very sad. How would you feel if you lost everything in less than an hour? How would you feel?"
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Cheung, whose shipyard was unscathed, said the situation could’ve been worse if the fire broke out at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive thing is that the fire broke out in the afternoon. If it had been now, at night… this place wouldn't be saved in time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At night time, everybody would have left the shipyard, and it would be too late to call the police."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they're still probing the cause of the fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air strikes targeted a bridge on the highway linking the Syrian cities of Homs and Hama, a war monitor said on Friday, as government forces scramble to secure Homs after Islamist-led rebels captured Hama and commercial hub Aleppo.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Fighter jets executed several airstrikes, targeting Al-Rastan bridge on (the) Homs-Hama highway... as well as attacking positions around the bridge, attempting to cut off the road between Hama and Homs and secure Homs," the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched their offensive a little more than a week ago, just as a ceasefire in neighbouring Lebanon took hold between Israel and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ally Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  To slow the rebel advance, the Observatory said Assad's forces erected soil barriers on the highway north of Homs, Syria's third-largest city which lies just 40 kilometres south of Hama.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of members of Assad's Alawite minority community were fleeing Homs on Thursday, for fear that the rebels would keep up their advance, the Observatory said earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels captured Hama on Thursday following street battles with government forces, announcing "the complete liberation of the city" in a message on their Telegram channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebel fighters kissed the ground and let off volleys of celebratory gunfire as they entered Syria's fourth-largest city. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Friday issued a warning about a stress-relieving toy that comes with a syringe, urging shops to remove the item from their shelves immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the toy could hurt children and parents should stop their kids from playing with it right away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, authorities said they inspected toy shops across Hong Kong after receiving a complaint, but have not found anything so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs will continue to closely monitor the market situation and step up patrols. If found, the department will take resolute enforcement action," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  A video circulating online shows a person using a syringe to inflate a mini baby doll, creating a bubble effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive has appointed Kennedy Wong as the chairman of the Council of the Baptist University (HKBU), and Michael Ngai as the head of the City University (CityU) Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  John Lee has also reappointed Lam Tai-fai as the chairman of the Polytechnic University (PolyU) Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointments will take effect from January 1, for a term of three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKBU, CityU and PolyU are important assets of Hong Kong, providing constant impetus for Hong Kong's development into an international post-secondary education hub, and commanding high expectations from the government and the public," the CE, who's the chancellor of these universities, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new appointees are all prominent leaders in society. They have been dedicated to serving the community in different fields over the years. They possess outstanding capabilities and rich experience, and have made remarkable contributions to Hong Kong's education sector."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he believes the new appointees will steer the universities to new heights.

 At least nine people were evacuated over a fire in Aberdeen on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out at a shipyard on Shum Wan Road at around 4.10pm, and was upgraded to a No 3 alarm half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least three jets as well as two breathing apparatus teams were deployed to the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed large plumes of thick smoke billowing into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," the Fire Services Department said.

    Court rejects bid to challenge denial of early release

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Friday rejected a bid by an inmate jailed for inciting secession to challenge the authorities' decision denying him early release under the city's homegrown national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ma Chun-man, also known as “Captain America 2.0” for dressing up as the comic book character at anti-government protests in 2019, was jailed for five years for promoting “Hong Kong independence”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After serving two-thirds of his sentence in March, Ma was denied an early release normally granted for good behaviour in prison, in line with the provisions of Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner of Correctional Services made the decision two days after the new security law took effect, saying he was "not satisfied that an early release of the prisoner will not be contrary to the interests of national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma filed a judicial review, arguing it was unfair and that the commissioner should have taken into account his “legitimate expectation” for early release.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written judgement handed down on Friday, judge Alex Lee ruled that the commissioner's decision was a "holistic, predictive and evaluative exercise based on a consideration of all the relevant factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma also failed to explain how his "legitimate expectation" of an early release would affect the national security assessment, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am unable to see how the fact that a prisoner based on the past practice of the CSD [Correctional Services Department] has a 'legitimate expectation' for early release may either increase or reduce the national security risk that might arise from his or her early release," Lee wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling means Ma will need to serve his full term until November next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The last remaining residents of the Wah Fu public housing estate in Pok Fu Lam that is set to be redeveloped will have to leave their homes several years earlier than envisaged, with officials planning to bring forward the third and final clearance and rehousing phase of the project.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tenants of Wah Chui House and Wah King House were originally expected to have vacated their homes by 2040/41, but the new plan announced on Friday is for these units to be empty by 2034/35.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residents involved will be able to move into the first buildings finished at the new Wah Fu Estate, Housing Authority officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first clearance phase, involving five other blocks, is still set to take place between 2026 and 2030 at the latest and the second phase, covering 11 blocks, is to be carried out by 2030/31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they can bring the third phase forward thanks to the government’s decision to use a "smart and green mass transit system" for the future South Island Line (West), instead of the heavy rail project originally planned. This change will allow sites at the estate to be freed up sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estate, next to Waterfall Bay, was built in 1967 and the 18 blocks are home to some 9,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, officials also announced clearance and rehousing arrangements for the first phase of the redevelopment of Choi Hung Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said residents of Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House will need to move out before April 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly tenants affected can apply to live in blocks scheduled for redevelopment in the second or third phase of the project, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Hung Estate, with its 11 blocks, was built in the 1960s. It is home to about 17,500 people.

    More subsidised dental services on the way
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782399_1_20241206163049.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it will roll out a series of projects to help people access dental services, with a focus on those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care suggested in a report that the administration should strengthen dental care for grassroots residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme to be implemented in the first quarter of next year, the government will provide a subsidy of HK$200 for those aged 13 to 17 to access services such as teeth assessment and scaling in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinics can set their own fees, but these must be transparent. Around 370,000 teenagers are predicted to benefit from the scheme each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from the second quarter of next year, people with financial difficulties can enrol in the Community Dental Support Programme to get subsidised services such as check-ups, fillings, tooth extraction and painkillers from non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who do not have to pay for medical expenses will be fully subsidised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients approved by the Hospital Authority to have their medical fees partly waived, living allowance recipients aged 65 to 74, and people with a referral from social workers will only have to pay around 10 percent of the fees involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 40,000 quotas will be available under the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Health Eddie Lee said the government is working with NGOs to enable more underprivileged people to see a dentist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have rounds of meetings with all relevant NGOs in Hong Kong, and most of them express very keen interest in collaborating with the government, but at the same time they do express some constraints such as manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon knowing that we are going to have more supply of dental health professionals, they [NGOs] are more ready and feel more comfortable to work with us."
  <br>
  <br>
  An online queuing system for general public sessions at Department of Health dental clinics will also be available from December 30.

    Giant red ball popping up across Hong Kong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge bright red ball is popping up in various places in Hong Kong from Friday until next Sunday as part of "the world’s longest-running street artwork".
 <br>
  <br>
  Since its debut in 2001, the enormous sphere has criss-crossed the globe, visiting cities including Paris, Chicago, London and Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong marks its 48th stop and it will make appearances at 10 spots across the SAR, starting with the Central Piers and ending on The Peak.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has already drawn curious spectators for selfies, but Anna preferred to sketch it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a one-off opportunity to come and draw it. I draw, I sketch all across Hong Kong, so I love to capture scenes in Hong Kong and this is just a rare opportunity to do something different. It's only here today," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always interesting. I think any art project anywhere is interesting and it's always good to support the arts and you want more to come here."
  <br>
  <br>
  American artist Kurt Perschke, the creator of the RedBall project, said he was happy to have the art work showcased in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project has been in Europe, in the US, all over in Sydney. I think one of the things that I've been excited about to bring it to Hong Kong is to see how the Hong Kong people respond to the piece and to see how we can explore and have fun with the city of Hong Kong, which is such a dynamic and amazing city. I've wanted to bring it here for a long time," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean retired military official said on Friday that the resignation of the country's defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, implies that the ministry is taking full responsibility for the short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law on Tuesday evening, before agreeing to lift it just several hours later after the National Assembly voted against the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Lieutenant General Chun In-bum, who retired in 2016, said the army did not have advance knowledge of Yoon's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The army were not aware why martial law was being declared and what their mission was in detail. They were told just a couple of hours before their mission was to occupy certain government buildings to include the National Assembly. Many of them even did not know where they were going until they arrived there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chun added that the army's reputation is unharmed, but morale has been affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reputation of the army is intact because the soldiers involved knew that something was wrong and did not pursue the given mission very proactively, thereby allowing the democratic system to work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the Korean people understand that the army had nothing to do with it. They were under orders from their commander-in-chief, who was the president of Korea. They probably thought that he was giving them a bona fide task."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chun said the country has to come up with arrangements to maintain law and order and avoid similar events from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that South Korea requires martial law to be an available option, so as to counter threats from North Korea.

    'New HK Island transit line could be 40pc cheaper'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said construction cost for the South Island Line (West) is expected to be 40 percent less than first thought.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rather than a heavy rail system proposed earlier, officials said they plan to build a "smart and green" mass transit system using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong, according to a paper submitted to Legco earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed transit line will span about 7.5 kilometres and link HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations. Officials hope to start the planning and design process next year, with construction set to begin in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco subcommittee meeting, lawmakers generally expressed support for the project, saying it has been a longstanding priority for Southern District residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government opted for the smart and green model after taking into consideration issues such as technical capabilities and financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said the new plan could be much cheaper than the original one.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the potential visual impact and noise issues for residents, Chan said authorities would seek residents' feedback before construction work begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As far as visual impact and noise are concerned, if we are using the smart and green mass transit system with rubber wheels, the noise levels generated will be less than for heavy rail systems, and it will take up less space,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Government Engineer Eddie Leung said he believes the new transit line will be able to cater to the needs of Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said it will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working there.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a new mass transit system for Kai Tak, Chan said the objective is to award the contract in 2026 and have it completed within three years after construction starts.

    Tourists satisfied with cruise terminal transport

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's largest cruise ship, the Spectrum of the Seas, docked at Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday morning, with passengers saying they were satisfied with the onward transport arrangements.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ship, which had departed from Shanghai, was carrying about 5,000 passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities strengthened transport services at the terminal, which included additional bus routes and shuttle services to various MTR stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two passengers from Germany said they were satisfied with the arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's very organised here and everybody can help you,” they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We stay two days in Hong Kong and then we fly home. It's a short stay. We bookmarked on the Victoria Peak or so, and then SoHo.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff were seen giving out LPG coupons to taxi drivers who picked up passengers at the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a short queue at the taxi stop, but a traveller from Australia said this wasn’t a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's okay so far. It’s been quite smooth. We're staying at the Disneyland Resort, so there'll be quite a bit of time spent there. Our daughter and grandson will be meeting us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a British tourist said she did not know that most taxis only accept cash for payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re going to take a taxi to the train station, and it’s got to be Hong Kong dollars… doesn’t say that anywhere, and there’s no ATM to get money, so it’s not really good at all,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at a welcoming ceremony for the cruise ship, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the authorities wanted the transport arrangements to be as smooth as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, these arrangements have proven to be rather effective. So well done. I'm so happy, and my thanks to everyone who contributed to us making this possible. Of course, we will continue to monitor the situation and fine-tune and improve those arrangements as we move along," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that he expects Hong Kong to attract more tourists in 2025 with different policies, including the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benjamin Bouldin, president of Royal Caribbean China, said sailing from Hong Kong allows cruises to have a diverse pool of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has always been a gateway for international travel and it's great to be able to get it back to that place. We know we get a slightly different guest mix from Hong Kong and that's one we're looking forward to reuniting with this winter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ship is scheduled to depart for Japan on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the vessel's seasonal home port, and the cruise line is expected to double its home port sailings to 10 next year.

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s leaders," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perdue, 74, served as a US senator from Georgia from 2015 to 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's a member of the Republican Party.
  <br>

    South Korean ruling party demands Yoon step down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ruling party chief demanded on Friday that President Yoon Suk Yeol stand down over his martial law attempt, warning he posed a great danger to the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han Dong-hoon said in televised remarks that credible evidence suggests that Yoon ordered the arrest of key politicians on the night he declared martial law this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was confirmed last night (Thursday) through credible evidence that on the day martial law was declared, President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed the chief of the Counterintelligence Command, his junior from university, to arrest key politicians, [labelling] them as anti-state forces, and mobilised intelligence agencies to arrest them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stunning comments from the head of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), almost guarantees enough lawmakers will vote to impeach the president on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's comments were also a U-turn from Thursday, when he said he would block the impeachment, and another party leader insisted all 108 members of the PPP would unite to support Yoon in Saturday's vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Han said on Friday that Yoon's refusal to acknowledge he had done anything wrong in declaring martial law on Tuesday night had prompted his change of position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Considering the newly emerging facts, I believe that a swift suspension of President Yoon Suk Yeol's duties is necessary to safeguard the Republic of Korea and its people," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said Yoon had not taken any personnel actions against military officials who had "illegally intervened". "Furthermore, he does not acknowledge that this illegal martial law is wrong," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if President Yoon continues to hold the office of the presidency, there is a significant risk that extreme actions similar to the current state of emergency could be repeated, which could put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's allies were alarmed and the opposition quickly filed an impeachment motion, saying Yoon "gravely violated the constitution and the law". A vote is set for Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition holds a large majority in the 300-member legislature and requires only a handful of defections from the PPP to secure the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the impeachment motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must take place within 60 days. (AFP)

    Spurs rocked as Huijsen seals Bournemouth win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ange Postecoglou slammed Tottenham's flops as furious fans turned on the Australian and his spluttering side after Bournemouth condemned them to a shock 1-0 defeat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dean Huijsen netted in the first half at the Vitality Stadium to leave Postecoglou's troubled team with just one win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old defender's first goal in English football after his close-season move from Juventus exposed the flaws in Tottenham's error-prone defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacklustre Tottenham were fortunate not to lose by a bigger margin as Andoni Iraola's side wasted several chances to increase their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's sixth Premier League defeat this season was another setback for the under-fire Postecoglou after last weekend's disappointing 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not good enough. We again fell into the trap of starting the game really well and then we conceded a really poor goal," Postecoglou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's disappointing – we have this propensity to shoot ourselves in the foot when we should be controlling games," he went on to say. "It's something we've done consistently, and we always pay the price for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having wasted a golden opportunity to qualify for the Champions League last season, Postecoglou is beginning to hear criticism of his overly-attacking tactics and this dismal display will add to the Australian's doubters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are languishing in 10th place, six points adrift of the top four heading into Sunday's London derby against second-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fans have every right to be disappointed. I got some pretty direct feedback with the way that we are going at the moment and that is rightly so," Postecoglou said after he was jeered by Tottenham fans after the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't like what was being said, because I'm a human being but you're going to cop it," he added. "All I can say is I'm determined to get it right, and will keep fighting until we do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Bournemouth have now beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex Iwobi scored twice as Fulham took advantage of a howler from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen to beat the Seagulls 3-1 at Craven Cottage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Silva's men were gifted the lead in the fourth minute when Verbruggen, under minimal pressure, tried to pass to Carlos Baleba on the edge of the area, with Iwobi intercepting and slotting into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton levelled in the 56th minute when Baleba fired past Bernd Leno from 25 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Fulham went ahead again with 11 minutes remaining when Andreas Pereira's corner skimmed off Calvin Bassey and went in off Brighton's Matt O'Riley for an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iwobi's curler sealed the points with three minutes left as Fulham moved up to sixth place after their third win in their last five league games. (AFP)

 Indonesian authorities have arrested a Chinese man sought by Beijing for allegedly helping transfer and laundering almost US$18 million from a criminal online gambling group in China, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yan Zhenxing was detained on Monday by immigration officers at a cross-border ferry terminal on Batam island, next to Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuldi Yusman, the Director of Immigration Supervision and Enforcement, said Yan was arrested following an Interpol red notice for him. The notices request law enforcement agencies worldwide to detain or arrest a suspect wanted by a specific country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusman said Yan, a Chinese national and permanent resident of Singapore, was arriving in Batam for holiday with his family when he was detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities brought the suspect, wearing a detainee’s orange shirt and a facemask, to a news conference on Thursday in the capital of Jakarta. The suspect did not make any statements and was not asked any questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusman said that Yan was named as a suspect by police in China’s Inner Mongolia region who allege he was involved in transferring and laundering more than 130 million yuan (US$17.8 million) from a criminal online gambling group.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Yan was handed to Indonesia's National Central Bureau Interpol in Jakarta on Thursday and a decision to deport or to extradite him to China will take some time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrest came just two months after immigration officers on the tourist island of Bali arrested a Chinese suspect sought by Beijing who allegedly helped to run investment scams that brought in over US$14 billion from clients in China. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Olympic dressage gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin was on Thursday banned for a year following a horse-whipping controversy that led to her withdrawal from the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rider was provisionally suspended by governing body the International Federation for Equestrian Sports just days before the start of the Olympics in the French capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEI said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare", which showed her repeatedly striking a horse with a long whip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, who has also been fined 10,000 Swiss francs, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is now sidelined from all competition until July next year, with the suspension backdated to July 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "British Equestrian and British Dressage have reciprocated the suspension, resulting in Dujardin's ineligibility to compete in any national competition or training events during this period," the FEI said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, Britain's joint most-decorated female Olympian, has won six Olympic medals including individual gold in 2012 and 2016. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 US military firms in response to the sale of American weapons to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move followed Beijing's strong objection to Washington authorising a potential US$385 million sale of spare parts and support for radars and F-16 fighter jets to the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said the move undermines its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also cover six top executives at some of the companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned companies would have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives would be barred from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday also urged Washington to "stop sending the wrong signals" after US House Speaker Mike Johnson had a phone call with Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to emphasise once again that the Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first red line that may not be crossed in Sino-U.S. relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has condemned Washington for allowing Lai to stop over in both Hawaii and Guam during a visit to the Pacific. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people were led to safety after the Hong Kong Observation Wheel at the Central Harbourfront malfunctioned on Thursday afternoon, with the ride remaining stationary for 40 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police and firefighters were called to the scene just after 5pm, after receiving calls for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wheel's operator revealed the attraction had experienced a technical failure in its "secondary system", which triggered a temporary stoppage as part of safety procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the company said operation resumed at 5.30pm, and all 190 passengers disembarked safely 15 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attraction was shut down for the rest of Thursday evening to facilitate safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists were left disappointed, including Meizi and John from the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of disappointed ... we're upset because we actually just [came] here to experience. Now it's closed, we're not sure why. We'll go somewhere else, I think," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, meanwhile, has requested an investigation report from the operator as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted the operator has maintained a solid record in running the attraction over the years, and was confident it can learn from the experience and avoid a repeat of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing operator, the Entertainment Corporation Limited, was awarded a tender in June to manage the wheel until 2029.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spring Festival has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by the UN's culture agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) made the decision on Wednesday, noting that the festival promotes family values, societal cohesion and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spring Festival, a tradition dating back thousands of years, marks the start of the new year in the Chinese calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unesco said the festival incorporates social customs to welcome the new year, seek blessings for good fortune, celebrate family reunions and promote community harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Minister of Culture and Tourism Rao Quan expressed gratitude for Unesco's recognition, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rao stressed that the Spring Festival stands as China's most important traditional festival, embodying Chinese people's aspirations for a better life and strong ties with family and the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this addition, China now has a total of 44 items on Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, the highest number in the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Workers and residents near a construction site in Shenzhen had to evacuate their homes and workplaces following a sudden ground collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen people remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at 11pm on Wednesday at a construction site in the city's Bao'an District, prompting local authorities to cordon off streets hundreds of metres away from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby residents and workers were seen evacuating their homes and factories, with some saying they were asked to do so at about noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, who was leaving with her pet, said she was not sure when could she return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They asked us not to stay here and asked us to evacuate. They think it's not safe here and asked us to move elsewhere," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A worker said there was no arrangement of accommodation from his employer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has to evacuate... I don't know how to describe my feelings now. I can't work and also I have to pay and live elsewhere," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another worker said he was working at a nearby site when the collapse happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was working and the electricity supply was suddenly cut off... We're moving out due to safety concerns, and we have to wait for further announcement from the company," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An all-out rescue has been launched and an investigation into the accident is underway, state media reported.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities will hold their first test event at the Kai Tak Arena within the sports park on Saturday, with two basketball games in the afternoon.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gates will open for the 2,000 spectators from 1.30pm, with the games tipping off at 3pm and 5pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators are advised to use the MTR to get there. No tickets will be sold at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said officials will set up six to eight security check counters for the drill.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long umbrellas and food and beverages, including empty bottles, are not allowed. If you do not have a bag, you can [go through] a dedicated corridor to speed up the security checking," he told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that the arena will host a concert on December 20 and test events for the 50,000-seater Kai Tak Stadium will begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's director, Tang King-shing, said the arena is an international-level multi-purpose venue with 10,000 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  When there are no special events, he said, the arena will be open to the public, noting that it can house up to 40 badminton courts at one time.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be another stress test for the arena and the youth sports ground next to it on Sunday afternoon, involving 12,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said those taking part will include Kai Tak residents, youth uniformed group members and civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the drill, officials will arrange dozens of buses and taxis to take participants to a drop-off area at Sung Wong Toi MTR Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be a fire drill at the youth sports ground.

    New appointments will improve governance: Lau Siu-kai

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Thursday said he thinks the reshuffle of the SAR cabinet will serve as a stimulus for better governance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told RTHK that he's not surprised by the new appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the principal officials' accountability system, it is quite normal for the chief executive to replace ministers from time to time so that he can get his job done better, get his government more popular, and to be seen as accountable to the public," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The replacements will also push existing officials to do a better job to "avoid being replaced by new ministers" and to improve overall government performance, Lau added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the public... expect them to do a much better job than their predecessors, given their two predecessors have done something which has been quite controversial before. The new ministers should be able to elicit new expectations from the public or the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the new culture and transport chiefs are expected to outperform their predecessors, and ensure smooth sailing of important projects like the Kai Tak Sports Park and next year's National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the next couple of years, the chief executive must be very concerned that the Kai Tak Sports Park and the national sports event will be held very successfully, and no mistake will be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If that is the case, it is not surprising that he is going to replace two officials. He will be more comfortable with the new ministers and be confident that they can get the job done and to enhance the popularity and the authority of the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that he thinks the two new ministers are hardworking and willing to face the media, and will work closely with professionals in their bureaus.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said she was confident she could bring impetus to the bureau and lead her team to push forward various transport policies and plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan replaces Lam Sai-hung who vacated his position in the first cabinet reshuffle of Chief Executive John Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Chan said the government was working on different railway projects, including the Tung Chung Line Extension, Tuen Mun South Extension and the Northern Link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transport and railway development is pivotal to the economic development of Hong Kong. We have promulgated a transport and traffic blueprint which lists out a number of railway and road projects," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming years, I will be leading my bureau in taking forward, steadfastly, in order to make sure that these projects are implemented and constructed on time, within budget."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with the implementation of the three-runway system, the government would continue to work on raising Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about bus fare hikes, Chan said authorities must consider what the public could afford, but pointed out the importance of bus operators having a stable financial situation, in order to ensure their quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan had previously served as the commissioner for transport, before becoming the permanent secretary for transport and logistics in 2020.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law on Thursday said her bureau will be well prepared for the official opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and for the 15th National Games next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Opportunities are everywhere. And so my priority would be to learn the latest development of my bureau's work and then to meet old friends, make new friends, have candid, useful, constructive discussions with all stakeholders, with a view of bringing culture, sports and tourism to new heights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting reporters for the first time after stepping into her new role, Law said she is confident in her new position, saying her experience in various bureaus has helped her learn fast and adapt to changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, no one knows everything. I have been an administrative officer and what is unique for this job is that every few years I change to a new field, I take up a new post. But as always, we do our best in getting our hands on a job as quickly as possible," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember about 16 months ago, I was deployed to the Housing Bureau. Although I did not have any experience in housing, I became the director of housing and I just learned what I had to do as quickly as possible. And I'm sure that my colleagues will continue to give me the best support they can."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she would not comment on the work of her predecessor, Kevin Yeung, saying her colleagues have been making an all-out effort and working tirelessly.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined the government in 1989 and had held various positions, including deputy commissioner for tourism, deputy secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs and commissioner for transport, before becoming permanent secretary for housing and director of housing last year.

    S Korean police investigate president for insurrection

<img alt="Posters featuring the face of President Yoon Suk-yeol are displayed at a bus stop near Yeouido National Assembly Station in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782210_1_20241205125603.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police have begun investigating President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged "insurrection" over his declaration of martial law, a senior police officer said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Woo Jong-soo, head of the National Investigation Headquarters of the National Police Agency, told lawmakers that "the case has been assigned," footage showed
  <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon's office said there would be no public statements on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Yoon will not make any statements today," a presidential official told reporters, as the opposition set an impeachment vote for 7pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yoon accepted the resignation of his defense minister as opposition parties moved to impeach both men over the stunning yet short-lived imposition of martial law that brought armed troops into Seoul streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted a joint motion to impeach President Yoon on Wednesday over his martial law declaration the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martial law lasted about six hours, as the National Assembly quickly voted to overrule the president, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Yoon’s office said he replaced Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun with Choi Byung-hyuk, a retired four-star general who is South Korea’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho will be the acting minister until Choi assumes the job after a parliamentary hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing is seen as a formality as the president holds the power to appoint ministers outside of the prime minister without the approval of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon hasn’t made any public appearances since he announced in a televised address that his government was lifting the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition parties earlier submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, alleging he recommended Yoon impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Kim offered to resign and apologised for causing disruption and concern to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim said “all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me,” according to the Defence Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment motion on Yoon was introduced at a parliamentary plenary session early Thursday, meaning it can be put to a vote between Friday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the motion will be scrapped if it isn’t voted within 72 hours of its parliamentary introduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties can submit a new impeachment motion if the current one is scrapped or voted down, according to National Assembly officials. (Agencies)

<img alt="Bitcoin broke US$100,000 for the first time as traders cheered Donald Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782207_1_20241205124359.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin topped the US$100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president rolls on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes just hours after the president-elect signalled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry with his choice of Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to nominate Atkins, a former SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from US$69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as US$101,512 Wednesday, just two years after dropping below US$17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long bitcoin will stay above the coveted US$100,000 mark is uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said it's an appropriate time for the government to appoint two "young and energetic" ministers, saying the bureaus they head serve important roles.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a reshuffle announced by the government on Thursday, Mable Chan, formerly the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics, is succeeding Lam Sai-hung as transport minister, and Director of Housing Rosanna Law has replaced Kevin Yeung as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said both the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau have a lot of work ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tourism promotion is a priority for this administration. Moreover, we are launching the Kai Tak sports complex, we will be hosting the National Games, and the blueprint for tourism, recreation and sport has just been unveiled. So there's a lot of work to be done," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same with the Transport and Logistics Bureau. We are launching the third runway, we need to strengthen and broaden our aviation network and set up a new maritime services and harbour development board."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB also welcomed the appointment of the two new ministers, hoping that they will strive to make breakthroughs in their respective policy portfolios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said he has high expectations for Law, saying she has demonstrated her vision for the future while working as the commissioner for transport and director of housing in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel today, it's basically an exercise from bottom-up. They ran years and years of modelling, looked at all the possible scenarios and then came up with something and that's it. It turned out quite well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her stint at the Housing Department... there was a lot of abuse of public housing privileges, and she responded very aggressively to our Roundtable demand to clamp down on the abuse."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker representing the sports and culture sector, Kenneth Fok, said he is looking forward to working with Law, saying that the government has been highly concerned about sports and cultural development.

<img alt="An image of the individual sought in connection with the shooting of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's insurance unit.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in New York City have launched a manhunt for a gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare’s CEO on Wednesday outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brian Thompson, 50, was shot around 6.45am as he walked alone to the New York Hilton Midtown from a nearby hotel, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter appeared to be “lying in wait for several minutes” before approaching Thompson from behind and opening fire, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had not yet established a motive.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,” Tisch said, adding that the shooting "does not appear to be a random act of violence.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Surveillance video reviewed by investigators shows someone emerging from behind a parked car, pointing a gun at Thompson’s back, then firing multiple times from several feet away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gunman continues firing, interrupted by a brief gun jam, as Thompson stumbles forward and falls to the pavement. He then walks past Thompson and out of the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From watching the video, it does seem that he’s proficient in the use of firearms as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson was shot at least once in the back and once in the calf, Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, who wore a jacket, face mask and large backpack, fled through midtown on foot before pedalling an electric bike into Central Park a few blocks away, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assailant remained at large Wednesday afternoon, sparking a search that included police drones, helicopters and dogs. (AP)

    New tolls to drive Tai Lam Tunnel capacity: official
   </title>

<img alt="Leung Sai-ho says Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by truck and van drivers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782188_1_20241205104029.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plans to impose time-varying tolls at Tai Lam Tunnel could help it reach full capacity, an official said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the Transport Department’s Assistant Commissioner Leung Sai-ho noted that if the tolls for the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long stay at their current levels, there would still be about 15 percent capacity untapped by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities hope the adjusted tolls would attract drivers to use the tunnel and help disperse traffic flow on alternative routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were thinking about how we might utilise remaining capacity and help spread traffic for different routes. People may be familiar with Tuen Mun Road and Tolo Highway. If we adjust the tolls, we hope to attract more drivers to use the Tai Lam Tunnel, which is the most crucial factor in our consideration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed changes will include three tiers of charges for “peak”, “normal” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of the present fixed toll of HK$58, private vehicles would pay HK$45 during peak hours, HK$30 during normal hours, and HK$18 during non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there was room to further lower the charges during peak hours, Leung said authorities had been very careful in setting toll levels, warning that if tolls are lowered again congestion may occur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also mentioned that the fall in tolls for commercial vehicles - down from current level of between HK$64 and HK$79 to HK$43 throughout the day - is quite high.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that data shows that Tai Lam Tunnel is heavily used by vans and trucks, indicating that the logistics industry relies on it to travel between the northwestern New Territories and urban areas.
