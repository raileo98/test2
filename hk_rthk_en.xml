<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the capital have stepped up security ahead of the annual “Two Sessions” meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates are in Beijing for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) starting on Tuesday and the National People's Congress (NPC) a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are more patrolling officers and security guards. Public security officers are also doing ID checks,” a Beijing resident told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the Netherlands said this is his first visit to Beijing, and he felt safe thanks to the presence of more officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the metro, there are guards at the entrance, so when you go inside they check [and] see if you bring no trouble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to go to the scanner, put your bags in the scanner and they just see if you have nothing with you that you can't bring.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC deputy, Johnny Ng, believes the arrangements this year will be more flexible, allowing them to communicate better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can flexibly have more communication with other delegates in CPPCC because we have over 2,000 [to] 3,000 people together,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that we can have more communications this year, in order to make sure Hong Kong can have more cooperation with other delegates and cities.”

    SpaceX calls off Starship test flight at last minute

<img alt="The latest test flight was to include another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794109_1_20250304101337.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)

    China warns of countermeasures against new US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to retaliate against fresh US import tariffs set to take effect later in the day, reiterating its stance that the Trump administration was trying to "shift the blame" and "bully" Beijing over fentanyl flows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra 10 percent duty that US President Donald Trump threatened China with last week is expected to enter into force at 0501 GMT on March 4, resulting in a cumulative 20 percent tariff in response to what the White House considers Chinese inaction over drug flows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariff represents an additional hike to pre-existing levies on thousands of Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Times reported on Monday that China had American agricultural and food products in its crosshairs, and would hit back with a series of both tariffs and non-tariff measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has repeatedly stated that the US' unilateral tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and undermine the multilateral trade system, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such measures will not solve [the US'] problems but instead will harm China-US economic and trade cooperation and disrupt regular international trade," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China urges the US to "immediately withdraw" its unilateral tariff measures that are "unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others," the ministry added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets in Hong Kong and on the mainland both opened lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the upcoming annual parliamentary sessions to gauge Beijing's policy path.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 328.02 points, or 1.43 per cent, to open at 22,678 points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Tech Index was down over three per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index dropped 0.6 per cent at the open, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market focus is shifting from the recent tech and AI themes to the National People's Congress meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing was expected to maintain its economic growth target at roughly five per cent and announce a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell more than one per cent in early trade, dragged by overnight Wall Street declines and a stronger yen, with US tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect as planned later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump also reaffirmed that he will increase tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent from the previous 10 per cent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump's announcement, Beijing warned on Tuesday that it would take countermeasures against new US tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated against the US dollar as the greenback slid, knocking down exporters shares and further dragging investor sentiment. (Agencies)

    Study paints grim picture of obesity

<img alt="Researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794096_1_20250304090417.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 per cent of all adults and a third of all children in the world will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action, a large new study said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The research published in the Lancet medical journal used data from 204 countries to paint a grim picture of what it described as one of the great health challenges of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," lead author Emmanuela Gakidou, from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of overweight or obese people worldwide rose from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021, the study found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a serious change, the researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years - or around 60 per cent of the global adult population in 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's health systems will come under crippling pressure, the researchers warned, with around a quarter of the world's obese expected to be aged over 65 by that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also predicted a 121-per cent increase in obesity among children and adolescents around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third of all obese young people will be living in two regions - North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean - by 2050, the researchers warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is not too late to act, said study co-author Jessica Kerr from Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That commitment was also needed for strategies "that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it's too much processed food or not enough parks," Kerr said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than half the world's overweight or obese adults already live in just eight countries - China, India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt, the study said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research is based on figures from the Global Burden of Disease study from the IHME, which brings together thousands of researchers across the world and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (AFP)

 US stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, after US President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions against China and levies on Mexico and Canada neared imposition, while European defence shares soared as the European Union sought increased military spending over Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had signed an executive order raising tariffs on China to 20 per cent, shortly after Trump seemed to rule out any change to the planned 25 per cent tariffs against Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent, while the broad-based S&P lost 1.8 per cent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq took a harsher tumble, closing down 2.6 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX - colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" - surged, hitting its highest level since December.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, BAE Systems surged 14 per cent, helping London's benchmark FTSE 100 index to a record high, the latest in a series over recent months.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that 25 per cent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start on Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Tomorrow - tariffs 25 per cent on Canada and 25 per cent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has said the tariffs are to force the two US neighbours to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas' trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments quickly rattled the US stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products, such as oil and electricity, at a lower 10 per cent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready," said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly.

<img alt="Ho Lok-sang believes pursuing high-quality growth and spurring domestic consumption are among the top priorities for mainland policymakers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793998_1_20250303165106.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

    Forest sink Ipswich on pens to reach FA Cup quarters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest needed penalties to beat Ipswich and book a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor was the only man who failed to score from the spot as Matz Sels' save edged the shootout 5-4 in Forest's favour to set up a last eight trip to Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sides are separated by 15 places and 31 points in the Premier League, but with Forest's priority securing Champions League football next season, Nuno Espírito Santo rested a number of his key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich sensed their opportunity and took the lead early in the second half when George Hirst headed in a corner at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Yates took advantage of some woeful defending to nod in an equaliser 22 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 30 minutes of extra-time came and went without a winner despite Nuno sending on top scorer Chris Wood and England international Morgan Gibbs-White.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sels, another of Forest's star performers this season, proved the hero after the first nine penalties of the shootout found the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In penalties one of the goalkeepers is going to be the hero," said Sels. "I'm happy I could help the team to the next round. It was the only penalty I was in the right corner." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A car driven into a crowd in the German city of Mannheim on Monday killed one person and injured several, police said, adding that one person had been arrested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We can now confirm that a car was driven into a pedestrian zone and that one person was killed," said police spokesman Stefan Wilhelm, adding that several people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that one suspect was arrested," he said, adding that "the investigation is continuing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilhelm said residents had been urged "to avoid the inner city area" after the emergency sparked a large-scale police operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police with heavy weapons cordoned off the area and police helicopters were seen in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reporter for news channel NTV reported that "at least one person is lying covered under a tarpaulin".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has in recent months suffered a spate of violent attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month a man drove a car into a trade union demonstration in the southern city of Munich, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December a car-ramming attack targeted a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg, killing six people and wounding hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mannheim itself was the scene of a stabbing attack at an anti-Islam rally last May in which a policeman was killed and five others were wounded. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunbeam Theatre – the North Point venue best known for its Cantonese opera performances – put on its last show on Monday night, bidding farewell to fans and opera lovers after more than half a century.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people were already there ahead of the final show at 7.30pm, in what would be another full house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Au Yeung brought along his son, 4, for a final look at the theatre that opened back in 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's a great memory for many people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never watched any Chinese opera before. But I think it is very valuable for most of the Hong Kong people, especially for the (older) generations. I hope the traditional Chinese opera can be extended to the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew To, a Malaysian who has been living in the SAR for over 20 years, was at Sunbeam Theatre for the second night in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I'm not taking photo, but I'm just here to walk around, to see the people around, what they are doing, how they're saying farewells... Just soaking in the moment before it's gone forever," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran actress Lana Wong, 94, performed at Sunbeam many times in the past. On this night, she came to watch the final show and say farewell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sunbeam is like my family, it's like my family being torn apart today. I am very, very sad," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said she doesn't believe the closure would affect the development of Cantonese opera, adding performances can still be staged in many other venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Chan also came for Sunbeam's last show, about the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping played by award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike Wong, she believes the end of the North Point landmark could have a negative impact on Cantonese opera because a lot of performances started off at Sunbeam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who lives in Tseung Kwan O, also said while fans can still enjoy performances at locations such as the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon, Sunbeam is more convenient because it's closer to her and can be easily reached by the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  A church will take over the location after Sunbeam ceases operation.

    Haifa attacker was Israeli Druze minority

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's police said the perpetrator of a stabbing attack in the northern city of Haifa on Monday was a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who recently returned from abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Druze are an ethno-religious minority among the Arab citizens of Israel, who's roots in the region go back centuries. They make up roughly 5.5 percent of Lebanon's population, 3 percent of Syria and 1.6 percent of Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip during an impasse over extending the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, a prominent Druze leader in Lebanon said on Sunday that he will soon visit Syria to meet its interim leader as tensions simmer between members of the minority group, the war-torn country’s interim government, and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The free Syrians must be cautious of the plots of Israel,” veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a news conference Sunday, accusing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of creating sectarian division and chaos in the country. “In Syria there is a plot for sabotage. There is a plot for sabotage in the region and for the Arabs’ national security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-week first phase of the truce ended at the weekend. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance to Gaza. The Israeli decision prompted the United Nations to call on Israel for an immediate restoration of the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany also urged Israel to resume aid flow "immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel's army said it struck on Monday a "suspicious motorised vessel" off the coast of south Gaza's Khan Yunis. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation groups are warning that around a quarter of almost 900 different species assessed in Hong Kong are at risk of local extinction, with types of birds and freshwater fish among the most in danger of disappearing from the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The findings were released on Monday in the 'The state of Hong Kong biodiversity' report by WWF-Hong Kong, in association with the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Outdoor Wildlife Learning Hong Kong and local researchers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assessments covered mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and freshwater crustaceans. Of the 886 species researchers checked, 232 were deemed to be on the brink of local extinction while 21 were confirmed to be extinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Examples of species under threat include the Oriental magpie which is at high risk of disappearing locally, and the crested bunting which has lost its breeding population here. The Chinese floating frog, meanwhile, is already gone from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With nearly half of the native freshwater fish species at risk of local extinction, threats such as channelisation and water pollution, and the invasion of non-native species must be tackled," said Dr Alphonse Tsang, Research Assistant Professor at Lingnan University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report is accompanied by the 'Hong Kong Terrestrial Biodiversity Hotspot Map 2025' which highlights what are described as 27 critical biodiversity sites outside the protected-area system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 80 percent of the hotspots are said to have suffered from eco-vandalism, while almost half are threatened by development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report includes more than two dozen recommendations for the authorities, including the establishment of special task forces to combat poaching and a review of plans to build on ecologically important habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to share this report to all the relevant government bureaus and departments, and we would request to have a kind of sit-down and share our thoughts with the relevant departments," said Dr Bosco Chan, director of conservation at WWF-Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxis that offer a variety of ways to pay and come equipped with systems to keep an eye on the driver  are about to arrive on the city's streets, with officials saying the only way is up when it comes to service quality.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five new taxi fleets with more than 3,500 vehicles between them were unveiled on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of the taxis are brand new and as well as accepting various forms of electronic payments rather than just cash, the fleets' various boasts include a number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, some electric vehicles, online booking, and driver monitoring systems "for passenger convenience and driving safety", according to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan said that after years of challenges, the taxi trade can only make improvements when it comes to service and she hopes the fleets will play a leading role in this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think today is a start," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can promote and attract more taxis to join such a kind of fleet management so as to provide more modern and more user-friendly services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Big Boss Taxi Company, CMG Fleet Management, Sino Development (International) Company, SynCab Service and Tai Wo Management are the operators granted licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between them they will run around 20 percent of all the city's taxis, with the first fleet expected to start operating by the end of this month and all of them arriving by July.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual session of China's top political advisory body will run from Tuesday to March 10, authorities announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee will begin on Tuesday 3pm at the Great Hall of the People, and about 3,000 Chinese and international journalists have signed up to cover the annual meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the week-long session will review the work of the national committee in the past year and plan for its work this year, while also discussing government work reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media briefing, the session's spokesman, Liu Jieyi, said 2024 was a critical year for realising goals and tasks set forth in the 14th Five-Year Plan, and this year would be a concluding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The CPPCC National Committee will carry forward our fine traditions, keep in mind our political responsibilities, give full play to the CPPCC's role as a specialised consultative body, serve the overall picture by focusing on the central tasks,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will strengthen theoretical and political guidance, actively produce policy advice, and contribute our ideas and strengths to building a great modern socialist country in all respects, and rejuvenating our nation through Chinese modernisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added that China’s economy maintained steady progress in the past year, and the country also made solid advances in high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As long as we face the challenges, be confident, and follow plans of the Central Committee of the Party, the high-quality development will be able to reach new heights,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic issues are always a priority in the work of the CPPCC National Committee. Over the past year, the National Committee offered advice on a series of important economic issues, and made solid and effective contributions to economic recovery and growth.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu said about 230 CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macau played active roles in the country’s economic and social development, and the CPPCC would continue to help the two SARs integrate into the overall development of the country.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said while Hong Kong's capital account, which is used to finance large infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis, was facing higher deficits, the city's operating account was still largely balanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On the operating account, our aim is to return it to balance as soon as possible, and start to register surplus. The coming [financial] year, in 2025-2026, we will be largely in balance. The deficit is only about HK$4 billion. When you take it into the context of the government expenditure of over HK$600 billion a year, I would call that largely balanced. And then the year after, 2026-2027, we [will] start to have an operating surplus," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the city must expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis so as to drive the SAR's technological growth, but that would also mean the government's capital account would be under an imbalanced fiscal situation in the short term due to the gap between revenue and expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to match the cash flow requirements. We can consider issuing some bonds with longer tenor. That is possible. But at the same time, I have to wait and balance between cost of borrowing and the tenor," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been concerns over the city's rising debt, given authorities' plan to issue up to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the coming five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan stressed the city's debt levels remain low and it should make good use of its borrowing capacity to meet the capital account cash flow gap.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Monday said it received 2,058 reports of corruption last year, up three percent from 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body said 480 of the complaints involved government departments, with the police getting the most at 108, followed by the Correctional Services Department with 44 and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department with 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 1,438 reports involving the private sector, more than a third concerned building management firms, with the construction industry and finance and insurance companies also seeing scores of complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 140 reports involving public bodies, including 25 linked to the Hospital Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said it prosecuted 207 people in 2024, including 16 civil servants, and 119 people were convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overall corruption situation in Hong Kong still remains very positive. We have not seen any sign of deterioration in terms of rise of corruption in Hong Kong,” said Bernard Chan, chairman of the ICAC's operations review committee.

 "Anora", the story of a sex worker who gets a chance at a new life when she marries a wealthy client on a whim, won five Academy Awards on Sunday, including the coveted best picture Oscar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The movie's 25-year-old star, Mikey Madison, was named best actress. The film also won best director for Sean Baker and trophies for original screenplay and editing.

   “Anora” creator Sean Baker won best director, best picture and two other Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday, bookending a dominant awards season for the American filmmaker whose stories seek to humanise sex workers and immigrants.
   <br>
   <br>
   Baker, 53, wrote, produced, directed and edited the film, and he swept in all four categories.
   <br>
   <br>
   With his four Oscars, Baker ties Walt Disney for the most wins in a single year in Academy Awards history.

   “Anora” was the night’s big winner with five statuettes overall — two more than “The Brutalist".

    "I grew up in Los Angeles, but Hollywood always felt so far away from me," Madison said on stage.
    <br>

    "To be here standing in this room today is really incredible."

<img alt="The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793951_1_20250303101834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery," said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory production accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew five percent last year, reaching the official target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10 percent duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang emphasised the importance of timely policy support, saying "March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Beijing on Tuesday to attend the annual opening meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The NPC meeting will open in the capital on Wednesday, while the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong on Thursday, and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will be the acting CE during his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Executive Council will not hold meetings these two weeks as local NPC and CPPCC members will need to attend the meetings in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport on Monday, a number of local NPC deputies expressed hope for policies supporting private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that in the government work report, there will also be supporting measures to encourage more private enterprises from Hong Kong and around the world to invest in our country," said Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Iris Wong said she was upbeat about the country's potential in tech and cultural industries despite Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone can see that whether it's DeepSeek or the development of robotics, and even the recently popular Ne Zha movie, these are all achievements of our innovation, culture and technology," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member and Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said he would continue to push for more Greater Bay Area residents to visit Hong Kong, including expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to eight more cities in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate and lawmaker Johnny Ng, meanwhile, said he would propose mechanisms for fraud prevention education during the meetings in the capital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's largest bubble tea and drinks chain Mixue Group jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday after the firm raised HK$444 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
 <br>
  <br>
  Mixue sold 17 million shares in the deal at a fixed price of HK$202.50 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shares started trading at HK$262 each and the gains outpaced a 0.8 percent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail investors subscribed for 5,258 times more shares than were on offer in that tranche, according to Mixue's filings, making it one of Hong Kong's most popular ever IPOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail subscription rate was just below Bloks Group whose retail book was 6,000 times oversubscribed, a record, in its January IPO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institutional tranche of the deal was 35 times covered, the filings showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixue is often seen as China's largest chain of iced drinks, milk tea and ice cream. However, it operates more like a raw-material supplier than a traditional beverage brand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1997 as a small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Mixue has grown into a franchise giant with over 45,000 stores globally by September 2024, surpassing Starbucks' 40,576 stores worldwide. (Reuters)

    Israel blocks humanitarian aid into Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday blocked aid flowing into Gaza, where a six-week truce enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance, prompting the UN to call for an immediate restoration of humanitarian assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli decision came as talks on a truce extension appeared to hit an impasse, after the ceasefire's 42-day first phase drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Truce mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Israel had announced a truce extension until mid-April that it said United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favouring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With uncertainty looming over the truce, both Israel and Palestinian sources reported Israeli military strikes in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported at least four people killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the fighting, said the "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people", comments echoed by Qatar which said it "strongly condemns" Israel's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which has rejected any talk of normalising ties with Israel without a Palestinian state, condemned the aid block as "a tool of blackmail and collective punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan said Israel's action "threatens to reignite" fighting in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres called for "humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union condemned what it called Hamas's refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block "risked humanitarian consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels called for "a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers erased an 18-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 133-129 in an NBA overtime thriller, boosting their league-best record with a 10th straight victory as Boston beat Denver in a clash of the past two champions.
 <br>
  <br>
  De'Andre Hunter, getting a starting nod as Cavs star Donovan Mitchell rested, scored 18 of his game-high 32 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as Cleveland poured it on late to grab their 50th win of the season against 10 defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made open shots, tried to get to the rim and get fouled," Hunter said of his late-game heroics, which saw him give Cleveland the lead for good with a three-pointer that put them up 131-129 with 30.8 seconds remaining in overtime
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter, acquired from Atlanta at the trade deadline, then came up with a steal and grabbed a rebound when Portland's Deni Avdija missed a three-pointer. Finally Hunter drilled a pair of free-throws to seal the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ty Jerome scored 25 points off the bench for Cleveland as six Cavs players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avdija led Portland with 30 points and added 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his first career triple-double. Anfernee Simons scored 27 points for the Blazers, who led most of the first half in pursuit of a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cleveland edged ahead 42-39 on Darius Garland's jump shot, Portland closed the first half on a 15-0 scoring run that sent them into the locker room leading 54-42.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs pulled level at 101-101 with just under five minutes left in the fourth quarter, and they traded the lead three more times before Simons made a pair of free-throws that tied it at 119-119 to send it to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're a resilient group," said Jerome, admitting the Cavs' come-from-behind win over the Celtics in Boston on Friday had taken it out of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's a good team," he added of the Blazers. "We just had to stay with it and make some shots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Boston, the Celtics let a big lead get away before holding off the Nuggets 110-103.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown scored 22 points and handed out eight assists to leading the reigning champion Celtics, who led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter only for Denver to pull within three points in the waning minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray scored 13 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to key the comeback, his driving layup off a rebound of a Brown miss pulling the Nuggets within 102-99 with 1:15 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBA Most valuable Player Nikola Jokic scored 20 points with 14 rebounds and nine assists for the 2023 champion Nuggets, but the Celtics came up with the shots when they needed them to snap a two-game skid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Al Horford finished with 19 points, Derrick White added 17 and Jayson Tatum had a relatively modest 16 with 11 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively, I thought we were good tonight," Brown said. "Offensively we missed some good looks.I missed some layups, I missed some open shots, but we were able to hang on." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian share markets dithered on Monday as the threat of imminent tariffs lurked in the background, while bitcoin surged on news it would be included in a new US strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump on social media announced five digital assets he expected to include in a new reserve, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, shot up more than 11 percent to US$94,110, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed 14 percent to US$2,528.

  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, helped by a softer yen.

  S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.1 percent, having staged a late rally on Friday after a week of heavy losses.

  On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25 percent level.

  An extra 10 percent levy on Chinese imports is also due to come into effect this week, just as the National People's Congress opens its annual session on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<img alt="Leaders gather at Lancaster House in London to discuss European security and Ukraine. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793931_1_20250303083142.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders closed ranks on Sunday in support of Kyiv at a London summit, where they pledged to spend more on security and assemble a coalition to defend any truce in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  And French President Emmanuel Macron, flying back from the summit, said in a newspaper interview that France and Britain wanted to propose a partial one-month truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which brought together 18 allies, came just two days after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in front of reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain, France "and others" would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, which they would then put to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London meeting came at a delicate moment for war-battered Ukraine, facing uncertain US backing and on the back foot against Russia's three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's row with Zelensky also raised fresh questions over the US commitment to Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Europe found itself "at a crossroads in history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a moment for more talk - it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  With no guarantee of US involvement, "Europe must do the heavy lifting", Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries were ready to help defend any truce, he added - without naming them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron, in an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, said he and Starmer were working on a one-month truce in Ukraine, "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was warmly embraced by many of the world leaders at the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the UK leader's Downing Street home, people gathered to show their support for Ukraine, some dressed in the country's blue and yellow national colours. (AFP)

    HK to push for greater integration at Two Sessions

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates attending the "Two Sessions" meetings this year said they're looking to make a range of proposals – from the development of artificial intelligence to a low-altitude economy – as the SAR seeks to further integrate into the nation's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be joining the country's largest annual political gatherings in Beijing this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker and local CPPCC member, Johnny Ng, told RTHK that he expects Beijing to put forward initiatives on technology – especially AI – in light of the emergence of DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays we have DeepSeek, this is open source. Open source means different industries can leverage AI to improve their efficiency, like the healthcare industry, the legal industry, the education industry," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I expect and I suggest the government to make a clearer blueprint to every different industry to leverage the benefits of AI... The government should have a clear blueprint and make some funding support."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects cybersecurity to be a key concern for policymakers amid the country's technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker and CPPCC delegate, William Wong, called for the development of a cross-border low-altitude economy, which he sees as key to boosting cooperation in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the development of a low-altitude economy is generally considered more mature on the mainland than in the SAR, Wong believes Hong Kong can play a significant role moving forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The research part can actually be done in Hong Kong, and then the sort of prototyping, the testing part can be done in Shenzhen, for example, because one project is split between two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So during the research and development process, there will be a lot of, for example, document transfer. There may be experimental samples transfer or even equipment transfer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stronger cross-border cooperation could also be on the cards when it comes to biotech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, said the Hetao zone is a major technology hub for the SAR, and the city should make good use of it and step up cooperation with the mainland, to help boost the country's overall biotech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member said the mainland could send its blood products to Hong Kong, so the SAR can capitalise on its advantage in medical research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financing for businesses is another key topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local NPC deputy, Ronick Chan, said many mainland enterprises, especially those in Qianhai, want to tap the Hong Kong loan market, but it's difficult for them to do so right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wants to expand the loan quotas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put in place a total quota in respect of how the Qianhai enterprises could borrow from Hong Kong's financial institutions, and also Hong Kong's companies and enterprises could also borrow from Qianhai's financial institutions. This kind of liberation, I expect, could accelerate the cross-border fund flow and also be beneficial to Hong Kong's loan growth," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other delegates at the "Two Sessions" said they'd like to see more support for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Stanley Ng wants more mainland tourists to be able to visit Hong Kong via the multi-entry visa scheme, which only covers Shenzhen residents at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the scheme will cover residents in Guangzhou before expanding further to other cities in the Greater Bay Area in future.

    'Kai Tak Stadium makes Hong Kong a hot destination'

<img alt="Lawmaker Adrian Ho says Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park went smoothly. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793928_1_20250303081026.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Monday said the Kai Tak Stadium places Hong Kong on the map as a "hot destination" for major concerts and events, after the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opened over the weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Adrian Ho was among the tens of thousands of people who attended the ceremony, where spectators were treated to a dazzling performance featuring athletes and celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said organisers of major events will now take notice of Hong Kong's brand new facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really never had a sort of internationally up-to-standard arena until right now. So I believe that we would be a very hot destination to host events not only just locally, but internationally too," the New People's Party member told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the size of the stadium is a draw, adding that international stars prefer to perform at newer facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Almost all organisers prefer sort of newer arenas. So I mean, this is the newest and hottest arena... If you look at events around the world everybody wants to go to a newer arena because of more state-of-the-art technology, technological advancements in terms of equipment, infrastructure, it's newer, it's better, so to speak, so I think for that matter... we're at an advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also said Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park -- which featured a fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau -- went smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a huge event, and I think all of the expectations that I had prior to the event in terms of security, arrangements, the audience, as well as the programme, pretty much met my expectations," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was great."

    Man Utd crash out of FA Cup as Fulham win shoot-out

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United's dismal season hit a new low as the FA Cup holders crashed out after a 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat against Fulham in the fifth round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's side trailed to Calvin Bassey's first-half opener at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised to force a 1-1 draw after extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham keeper Bernd Leno was the hero in the shoot-out as he saved from Victor Lindelof and Joshua Zirkzee, with the visitors converting all four of their kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booed off at half-time, it was another wretched result for United in a season that sees them languishing in 14th place in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13-time FA Cup winners had reached the final for the last two seasons and beat Manchester City to lift the trophy last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be no trip to Wembley this season for United, who have only the Europa League left as a silverware chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard. We had the best chances in the game but in the end the penalties can go both ways and today it was not our day," Amorim said. "I know that we are losing games and losing trophies during this season but the goal is to win the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how long it's going to take," he added. "But if you think like that, we can suffer a little bit in these defeats."
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been another testing week at Old Trafford, with 200 job cuts announced and United struggling to draw with Everton and barely beat lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim admitted that life is "hard" just now for United and this was the latest hammer blow to the under-fire Portuguese coach, who only arrived in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head to Real Sociedad for the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday before hosting Arsenal in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Amorim to realise United were in for another dispiriting afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund fired over from an acute angle after Christian Eriksen's cross found the much-maligned United striker, whose goalless drought has now reached 18 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eriksen's curler was fisted away by Leno, but that did little to satisfy fans frustrated by years of underachievement. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza said four people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli attacks on Sunday after the first phase of a fragile truce in the territory drew to a close.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Since this morning, four dead and six wounded" have been brought to "hospitals in the Gaza Strip following Israeli attacks in various parts of the territory", the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that it struck suspects planting an "explosive device" in northern Gaza as the first phase of a fragile ceasefire with Hamas ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel and Hamas to maintain their ceasefire in Gaza to prevent the conflict-weary region from sinking back into despair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire agreement has saved countless lives and offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering. Any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair," it said in a statement, adding the truce was "essential."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came as Israel said it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza and as deadly attacks were reported in the territory after Israel and Hamas hit an impasse of how to proceed further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged on Sunday the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire deal, calling on the European Union to pressure Israel to enforce it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January," Abdelatty said at a press conference in Cairo, urging the EU to exert "maximum pressure on the parties, especially the Israeli party, regarding commitment to the ceasefire agreement". (AFP)

    Ailing Pope hails faithful's 'support' and 'affection'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for more than two weeks with double pneumonia, on Sunday thanked believers around the world for their "support" and "affection" as he missed delivering a third straight Angelus prayer in person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been treated at the Gemelli hospital in Rome since February 14, missed the traditional weekly prayer, which instead was published in the form of a letter the Vatican released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world. I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all," wrote the Argentine pontiff.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by calling for peace in addressing conflicts around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray above all for peace. From here, war appears even more absurd. Let us pray for tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu," the pope wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Vatican, the pope spent "a calm night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is still resting," the Holy See said earlier in its latest health update on the head of the Catholic Church.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, it had said the pope's condition was "stable", adding that he was still receiving oxygen, had no fever, had been eating, was alert and praying. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local delegate to the country’s top advisory body plans to ask for measures on facilitating people flow within the Greater Bay Area, during the upcoming “Two Sessions” meetings in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tang, who is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member, came up with a number of proposals on better integrating Hong Kong into the country’s development and the Greater Bay Area, as well as leveraging the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former chief secretary hoped the central government would expand the multiple-entry visa scheme currently in place for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one “new concept”, as he put it, would be on enriching the financial system on a closed-loop basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like I’m proposing to open up a giant back door to undermine the currency controls of the country, but to allow the people in the Greater Bay Area to take much better advantage of the financial instruments available in Hong Kong that are otherwise unavailable to the Shenzhen residents,” he said in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang said the latest budget blueprint unveiled by the SAR government had focused on stability, calling it “commendable and reasonable”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you look at it from three basic principles — first is stability, second is development, and third is investing for future — they have all three parts in it,” said Tang, who formerly served as financial secretary himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Generally, it is an acceptable budget, in that aspect, and that three years is a reasonably period for a forecast to return to a budget surplus.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s latest budget, he stressed containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and France will work with Ukraine on a plan to end the fighting with Russia, which will later be presented to the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States," Starmer told British media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer hosted Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Sunday for a summit on the conflict, which has taken on huge significance in the wake of the clash between the Ukrainian president and US counterpart Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said "nobody wants to see" the scenes of the two leaders' White House clash, and that "I am clear in my mind that he (Trump) does want a lasting peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister has presented himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe, and met with Trump in Washington on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will come again if he's given the opportunity to do so..., which is why I've been so centrally focused on what a guarantee is. How do we defend the line if a line is agreed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Where that physical line would be is "a subject for discussion", said Starmer. (AFP)

    Private US spaceship lands on Moon

<img alt="A US company successfully landed its spacecraft on the Moon on Sunday, marking only the second private mission to achieve the milestone. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793887_1_20250302174506.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefly Aerospace became the second US company to land on the moon on Sunday with its debut Blue Ghost lander, kicking off a two-week research mission as one of a handful of private firms to reach the frontlines of a global moon race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight controllers at Firefly's Austin, Texas headquarters watched as Blue Ghost descended toward the moon's surface at a gentle two miles per hour, confirming on a live stream that the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're on the moon," declared Will Coogan, Blue Ghost Chief Engineer at Firefly Aerospace, from mission control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefly became the second private firm to score a soft moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and, last year, Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every single thing was clockwork, even when we landed, and then after, we saw everything was stable and upright," Firefly CEO Jason Kim said on stage at a company watch event in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the audience were hundreds of Firefly employees, space industry officials and senior Nasa leaders, including the agency's acting administrator Janet Petro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Firefly's in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two navigation cameras onboard Blue Ghost were used to spot hazards on the lunar surface during its final descent, helping the spacecraft steer toward an ideal landing spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impact sensors on the craft's four carbon-composite legs triggered Blue Ghost's engine to shutdown upon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two solar panels on the side and one of the top will power the lander and its research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus minus 173 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed by Nasa and its flagship Artemis moon programme, private companies are playing an outsized role in the modern moon race with the hopes of stimulating a lunar market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 for the first time since 1972. (Reuters)

    Israel suspends entry of supplies into Gaza

<img alt="Israel is stopping the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” if Hamas does not accept new ceasefire proposals. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793880_1_20250302160735.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday slammed Israel's suspension of supplies and aid entering Gaza, describing it as a "war crime" and a violation of the ceasefire agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement", the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced earlier on Sunday that it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza, and threatened "consequences" for Hamas if it did not accept a proposal for a temporary extension of the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended," his office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will not accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists with its refusal, there will be other consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said earlier on Sunday that it supported a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, or April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the proposal came from the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopia dominated the competition at the Tokyo Marathon on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's categories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tadese Takele won the men's race in a time of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 23 seconds on Sunday as Uganda's double Olympic track champion Joshua Cheptegei finished ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele broke clear of the pack with around four kilometres to go in warm conditions to claim his first major marathon title, shaving a second off his previous personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele's compatriot Deresa Geleta was second in 2:03:51, with Kenya's Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich third in 2:04:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The weather wasn't a problem, it wasn't too hot and for me it was comfortable," said Takele.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The course was good and this was a great day for me. In the future, I hope to run even better than I did today."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's race, Ethiopia's Sutume Asefa Kebede defended her title, finishing in 2 hours, 16 minutes, 31 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya's Winfridah Moraa Moseti was second in 2:16:56, with Ethiopia's Hawi Feysa third in 2:17:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheptegei, who won gold in both the Tokyo Olympics 5,000m in 2021 and the 10,000m in Paris last year, was running his second marathon after making his debut at the distance in Valencia two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old finished in a time of 2:05:59.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, who was running her first marathon in 10 years at the age of 51, finished in a time of 2:57:26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Radcliffe also plans to run the Boston Marathon next month. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Sunday said most civil servants understood the need for a pay freeze given the government’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yeung said she had been told the move would not affect morale.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During the discussions, I approached many civil service colleagues and most of them told me they understood the situation. Some even said it had been expected. Before the budget announcement, some union representatives had said that it would not affect morale,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that two percent of the civil service would be cut between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, with about 10,000 civil service posts expected to be slashed by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the two percent cut was a minimum requirement, and departments could reduce more posts if they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yeung said some vacancies had to be filled such as firefighters and teachers.

<img alt="Paul Chan said on TVB that around 15 percent of people head to the mainland in private vehicles, and taxing them would not affect a great amount of people." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793870_1_20250302124329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said officials plan to go ahead with a proposed land departure tax for private cars, saying this represented a wealthier demographic in society.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposal announced in the budget last week met some opposition, with some lawmakers saying it wouldn't help Hong Kong's integration into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan said these drivers amount to about 15 percent of the some 100 million departures annually, so there wouldn't be too many people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we spent much on these border facilities in terms of construction, and there are also maintenance costs," he said on a TVB programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a user's pay perspective, we ought to get some money back. We don't want to bother the general public."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed the government was still open to ideas and welcomed discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said there were many ways for people to cross the border, adding the government would not consider charging passengers who take the express rail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the administration plans to raise more than HK$150 billion worth of bonds every year for the coming five fiscal years, in part to finance infrastructure projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would mainly issue short-term bonds, but added it has also received local market feedback expressing interest in longer term, Hong Kong dollar bonds that could be considered stable investment tools.

    Technology chief pledges to foster AI development

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology and innovation chief Sun Dong on Sunday said policies related to artificial intelligence (AI) mentioned in last month's budget show the government’s commitment to high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan described AI as a “core industry” as he delivered the budget for the 2025-26 financial year, and said the government would support research and development efforts in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also announced that HK$1 billion would be earmarked for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the founding of the institute could benefit society in many ways, including applications in areas like government services, law, finance, healthcare and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that with AI advancing to its current level, every country and region needs to achieve breakthroughs in important areas, particularly in applications. Of course this involves some free exploration. Therefore while we want to encourage different research teams to explore AI freely, we also need to combine our limited resources to focus on development. That’s part of why we’re establishing the institute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology chief also noted there were 4,700 start-ups in the city at the end of last year, describing them as important pillars for Hong Kong’s future development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is four times what it was before the pandemic and over a 10 percent increase from the year before. The number is expected to go up again this year,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “Start-ups are looking at Hong Kong's innovation scene, government policies, the overall resources availability, and whether the business environment is good. When start-ups come here, talent will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has to have its own “star start-up” as it works its way to become an international I&T centre, the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun will lead a delegation, including representatives from the I&T sector, to Spain and Portugal on Sunday evening, to strengthen ties and cooperation between Hong Kong and the two countries in the field.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered a new trade investigation that could heap more tariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25 percent tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods due next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his third new tariff probe in a week, Trump signed a memo ordering Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to initiate a national security investigation into US lumber imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The trade law is the one Trump also used to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe covers derivative products made from lumber which could include furniture such as kitchen cabinets, which in some cases are made of US lumber that had been exported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order said the Commerce Department investigation must be completed within 270 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered new steps within 90 days to increase the domestic supply of lumber by streamlining the permitting process for harvesting lumber from public lands and improving the salvage of fallen trees from forests and waterways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order calls for new or updated agency guidance to facilitate increased timber production, including quicker approvals for forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the lumber import probe would counteract the actions of big lumber exporters including Canada, Germany and Brazil, which he said were "dumping lumber into our markets at the expense of both our economic prosperity and national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That stops today with a pair of Trumpian actions designed to both bolster supply of and demand for American timber and lumber," he told reporters on a conference call ahead of the signing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said that increasing reliance on imported lumber represents a possible national security risk partly because the US military consumes significant quantities of lumber for its construction activities and because increasing dependence on imports for a commodity with ample domestic supplies is a danger to the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official did not provide details on a proposed tariff rate under the Section 232 lumber probe, but Trump earlier this month told reporters that he was thinking about imposing a 25 percent tariff rate on lumber and forest products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said any tariffs resulting from the probe would be added to the existing 14.5 percent combined anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Canadian softwood lumber.
  <br>
  <br>
  These were the result of a long-running US-Canada trade dispute over Canada's low stumpage fees on public lands, which Washington argues is an unfair subsidy. Most US lumber is harvested from private land at market-determined rates. Home builders have long criticised the tariffs as raising lumber prices and contributing to home price inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said the new lumber duties also would stack on top of Trump's threatened 25 percent general US tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods that are scheduled to take effect on Tuesday unless Trump is persuaded by the two countries' efforts to secure their borders and halt fentanyl trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff probe follows Trump's order on Tuesday for a new Section 232 into copper imports, aimed at rebuilding US production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware and the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 21, Trump ordered US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to revive investigations aimed at imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy digital services taxes on U.S. technology companies. Canada would again be in the firing line for such penalties, along with France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, India and Turkey. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 CK Infrastructure Holdings is considering a bid for KKR-backed British waste management firm Viridor, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based company is in talks with potential advisers as it evaluates a possible offer, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Bloomberg reported that KKR is exploring options for Viridor including a sale that could value the business at as much as 7 billion pounds (US$8.8 billion) including debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Infrastructure and KKR did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. A representative for CKI did not immediately respond to Bloomberg queries and KKR declined to comment to Bloomberg, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor operates energy recovery through its facilities in the UK to generate energy from residual waste, according to their website. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American singer Angie Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, died at 63 early on Saturday, a representative confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deborah R. Champagne, Stone's representative who last spoke with her shortly after 9 pm ET, said Stone died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, following a performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guy Todd Williams, better known as Rahiem from the Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, which was the first rap group inducted into the Rock Hall, said nine other passengers were in a van with Stone during the accident. He said she was the only fatality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone, a native of South Carolina, was a member of female hip-hop trio The Sequence. The group's most popular song, Funk You Up, peaked at 15 on Billboard's Hot Soul Singles. Rolling Stone described it as the first rap hit performed by women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was signed to the now defunct Sugar Hill Records, a label under of Warner Music Group, which also represented Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, among other artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stone released her debut solo album, Black Diamond, in 1999. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following year. Her highest charting album -"The Art of Love & War" released in 2007- peaked at 11 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside of music, she acted in several films with her debut being "The Hot Chick" alongside Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams. Stone also starred in "The Fighting Temptations" with Beyonce and Cuba Gooding Jr. (Reuters)

<img alt="Manchester City's English midfielder Nico O'Reilly celebrates scoring the team's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793851_1_20250302075410.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City survived a scare to beat giant killers Plymouth 3-1 and progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, after Crystal Palace striker Jean Philippe-Mateta was hospitalised in the Eagles' 3-1 win over Millwall.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had shocked Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round and were on course for another stunning upset at the Etihad when Maksym Talovierov headed them in front on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argyle boss Miron Muslic said it would be the "biggest honour" of his life to go head-to-head with Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  With FA Cup glory City's only realistic hope of silverware this season, Guardiola surprisingly rotated his side with Erling Haaland among those left on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was one of City's youngsters who took his chance to shine as Nico O'Reilly turned the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslic will be furious at the manner of both the 19-year-old's goals as he twice headed in from set-pieces under little pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Reilly's equaliser just before half-time calmed City's nerves before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that point Guardiola had summoned Haaland off the bench and he teed up the third for Kevin De Bruyne in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Big compliments to Plymouth for making our job so difficult. They were incredibly organised, but we played a good game," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace's progress into the last eight came at a cost as Mateta was stretchered off the field straight into an ambulance and taken to hospital in the early stages of their south London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was sent off just eight minutes in after catching Mateta's head with his boot as he raced out of the penalty area to clear the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Michael Oliver only issued a red card after a VAR review of the challenge, with Roberts winning the ball before accidently crashing his boot into Mateta's head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today," Mateta posted on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace later said he had been discharged from hospital after receiving 25 stitches "to a severe laceration to his left ear".
  <br>
  <br>
  Manager Oliver Glasner said the incident could have ended the Frenchman's career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career," said Glasner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace chairman Steve Parish described as the "most reckless challenge" he had ever seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made use of the man advantage to book their place in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japhet Tanganga's own goal put Palace ahead in the 33rd minute before Daniel Munoz prodded in the second seven minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth advanced to the last eight for only the third time in their history with a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Wolves after their 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson's 30th-minute opener for Bournemouth was followed by VAR controversy as Milos Kerkez had a second ruled out for offside after an eight-minute check when the new semi-automated version of the system broke down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha levelled for Wolves with a second-half rocket to force extra-time, but the Brazilian was sent off for violent conduct after repeatedly clashing with Kerkez just before the penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Matt Doherty missed when he had the chance to send Wolves through, Boubacar Traore hit the crossbar and Luis Sinisterra sealed the win for Andoni Iraola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milutin Osmajic taunted Burnley fans after helping Preston into the quarter-finals for the first time since 1966 with a 3-0 win at Deepdale.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the Championship sides played in the league two weeks ago, Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri accused Osmajic of racist abuse, allegations which the Preston striker denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnley players declined to shake hands with Montenegro international Osmajic before their latest meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osmajic got Preston's second goal late in the first half and celebrated by taunting Burnley fans with his hands cupped around his ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robbie Brady and Will Keane were also on target as Preston ended Burnley's 23-game unbeaten run. (AFP)

    Zelensky gets warm welcome in UK after Trump clash

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday gave Volodymyr Zelensky a warm welcome in London, a day after the Ukrainian leader's clash with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  And ahead of Sunday's summit in London to discuss how to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's forces, Starmer reiterated his support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States," he said in a statement issued late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours earlier, Ukraine and the UK unveiled a £2.26 billion (US$2.84 billion) loan agreement to support Ukraine's defence capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilised sovereign Russian assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine," Zelensky said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is true justice -- the one who started the war must be the one to pay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters cheered as Zelensky's convoy swept into Downing Street, where he was embraced by Starmer and posed for photographs before heading inside the British leader's home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street," Starmer told Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, for such big support from the very beginning of this war," Zelensky responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders met behind closed doors for around 75 minutes, and embraced again as Starmer escorted Zelensky to his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier Saturday Zelensky had stressed that Trump's support was still "crucial" for Ukraine despite their row the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash was a further shock to Kyiv's European allies, still adjusting to Washington's new stance on the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday as cameras in the Oval Office rolled, Trump berated Zelensky for not being "ready" for peace with Russia, triggering alarm across Europe. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says people should make sure they are fully vaccinated against measles before travelling, after a man was hospitalised with the disease following a trip to Vietnam. The 38-year-old, who travelled to the country in early February, is now stable at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although the CHP has classified the case as imported, the man stayed at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and visited its cafeteria while he was infectious.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has set up a hotline on 2125 2372 for those who may have been exposed. It will operate until Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles cases are rising in some countries due to low vaccination rates. While Hong Kong's vaccination coverage exceeds 95 percent, international travel poses a risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP controller Dr Edwin Tsui said anyone unsure of their vaccination status, especially travellers, should consult a doctor.

<img alt="O'Sullivan had been looking forward to playing in front of a home crowd in Hong Kong, after becoming an SAR resident last October. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793832_1_20250301225306.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

 Cars more than 15 years old will soon be barred from refuelling in New Delhi, the city's government said on Saturday, as part of measures to reduce the Indian capital's hazardous pollution levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Delhi is regularly ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world and is blanketed in acrid smog each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pollution is primarily blamed on agricultural burning by nearby farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds worsen the situation by trapping deadly pollutants each winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diesel and petrol cars older than 10 and 15 years, respectively, are not allowed to ply on Delhi roads, but many have been found flouting the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters on Saturday that the decision to stop fuel for the old cars was made at a "marathon meeting" on air pollution to "find out the diseases and its remedies."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have decided to stop giving fuel to vehicles more than 15 years old after March 31, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "gadgets" would be installed at petrol pumps to identify such vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sirsa said other decisions taken include turning barren land into "new forests" and getting university students involved in planting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would make it mandatory for high rises, hotels and Delhi airport to install anti-smog guns and gadgets to control pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public health crisis has grown steadily worse over the years, and weeks-long school closures across the capital, aimed at shielding vulnerable children from the harmful air, are now an annual occurrence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants – dangerous cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs – surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Piecemeal government initiatives, such as partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air, have failed to make a noticeable impact. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau were some of the highlights for the opening ceremony of Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show, which went on until 8:35pm, half an hour longer than scheduled, was capped by a brief fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators said they were dazzled by the overall experience. Jimmy and Dhillon said they were super excited to see Donnie Yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had a fencing demonstration just now, mixing kung fu and fencing. Donnie Yen fencing against Vivian Kong, the Hong Kong champion. It looks like we are in the Olympics," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Gary, was pleased with his clear view to the stage, even he sat in the upper section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My seat is the top (row) one. So my sight is all the stadium and very huge. It makes me feel great. I’m very proud that Hong Kong has this (stadium)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alan, who went with his girlfriend, praised the facilities inside the stadium, although he felt the sound quality can be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of toilets is beyond my expectations… Just [every] few steps there's a toilet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped spectators can bring their own food or drinks in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did not buy any drinks or food inside - just the price consideration. We wanted to buy the popcorn but that is not the fresh popcorn, just pre-prepared food," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Zhuhai was overjoyed to see Andy Lau in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone was hoping to see the four heavenly kings," Zhang said, referring to 1990s Hong Kong pop idols Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was awesome enough to see one of them show up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The event also drew in Jeffery and Arnold, both engineers involved in the sports park project.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like what you said, our baby. So it feels like we accomplished something because of our hardships and all the struggles that we faced here during the construction. Yeah, all the tears, the sweat," Jeffrey said.

    Hamas says 'no progress' on second phase of ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on the second phase in Cairo, with the goal of bringing an end to the war with the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said there had been “no progress” on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had “no idea” when negotiations might start again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas started the war with its October 7 2023, attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Hamas said that it “reaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to “immediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were “also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire’s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN food agency, the World Food Programme, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal’s first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in fighting helped “restoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,” the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The ceasefire must hold,” it said. “There can be no going back.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The brand new Kai Tak Sports Park will help Hong Kong soar to new heights, the chief executive told the crowd during the opening ceremony on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, John Lee also underlined his vision for the city’s newest landmark, built on the site vacated by the old airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the first successful trial flight 100 years ago to the establishment of an airport, today we have created Kai Tak Sports Park … a brand new stage for sports, culture and arts facing the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the park will be the perfect venue to kick off “Hong Kong Super March,” outlining a list of mega-events scheduled for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like this very stadium's retractable roof, the sky is the limit. From snooker, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens to football, the upcoming sports events are sure to delight all - on and off the pitch,” he declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was then joined onstage by political and business leaders for the launching ceremony. They included the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, as well as Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, which built the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 33,000 or so were treated to a Chinese drum performance and lion dance before the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media were allowed to stream roughly the first half an hour of the show, until 7 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the ceremony – including performances by singers Joey Yung, and demonstrations by national athletes – was kept under wraps until 9.30 pm, when four free-to-air TV channels will broadcast the event in full.

    PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years

<img alt="Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's appeal as an " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793814_1_20250301193855.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outlawed Kurdish militants on Saturday declared a ceasefire with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down arms after fighting the Turkish state for over four decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today," the PKK executive committee said, referring to Ocalan and quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree with the content of the call as it is, and we say that we will follow and implement it," the committee based in northern Iraq said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20 percent of Turkey's 85 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party on Thursday relayed his appeal for PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organisation's dissolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but "for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created" and Ocalan "must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he "must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants, including his friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made until October, when a hardline nationalist ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Erdogan backed the rapprochement, his government cranked up pressure on the opposition, arresting hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erdogan on Friday said Ocalan's appeal was a "historic opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Turkey would "keep a close watch" to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were "brought to a successful conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the pressure of terrorism and arms is eliminated, the space for politics in democracy will naturally expand," Erdogan promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call, saying it was "a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against the Kurdish militants. (AFP)

    Pope spends 'peaceful night' after breathing crisis

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for two weeks with pneumonia in both lungs, spent a peaceful night after suffering a breathing crisis, the Vatican said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night and is resting," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff was put on a ventilator because of an "isolated" breathing crisis on Friday, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors said it would take the next 24 to 48 hours to see if this breathing trouble has worsened his condition or not, a Vatican source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff is "not out of danger" but was "in good spirits," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was hospitalised on February 14 with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into double pneumonia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical experts have warned that Francis's age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope, head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics, had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man and has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is prone to bronchitis and suffers from hip and knee pain, which has made him reliant on a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, Francis has continued to work from the special hospital suite on the Gemelli's 10th floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also has been doing breathing exercises in between resting and praying, according to the Vatican. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jubilant and excited crowds arrived at Kai Tak Sports Park ahead of the opening ceremony on Saturday night, but some were left confused by the rules of admission.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 90-minute ceremony will begin at 6:30pm, featuring celebrities including Donnie Yen, Gin Lee, MC Cheung, Joey Yung, as well as SAR athletes Vivian Kong and Jordan Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Edward, arrived two hours in advance. He said he couldn’t wait to see the stars and check out their performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course Joey, MC - those are the perfect performances that I want to look at. Also I know some of the sports stars will be joining. I'm looking forward to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man, surnamed Wong, said his daughter helped him buy a ticket. The 67-year-old said he has never been to a big stadium before and called this an "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will welcome 33,600 spectators, including 8,500 lucky ones who managed to purchase tickets online.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to get in, they had to show up with electronic vouchers and identity documents to redeem a physical ticket by 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bosco and his girlfriend arrived half an hour before the deadline. He said the arrangement was a bit of a hassle but described the redemption process as smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it'll be better if the seats are arranged when I buy the tickets ... It's a bit troublesome to come here a few times," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us it's quite smooth because ... not many people are here. The process takes about five minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of others showed up after 3pm, including Alsen, who travelled from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was thankful to get the ticket, but felt that signage directing spectators could be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many instructions that I can't identify. There's information but it still feels a bit hard for me to find the right place. I asked some police and others," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were allowed to enter the main stadium from 4:30pm, after passing security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them were unaware of the list of items prohibited inside the venue. These include long umbrellas, plastic, glass or metal food containers, water bottles and so on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of odd. Maybe it's for safety reasons, but kids need their own water bottles. It means we need to spend money inside," said Mavis, who attended the gala with her two daughters and husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will not be broadcast live, but four local TV channels, including RTHK, will carry the show at 9.30pm.

 At least four people died from their injuries in India after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials said on Saturday, as rescuers deployed helicopters to search for the remaining five missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 55 workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp on Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Saturday, the Indian army said 50 people were initially rescued, but among them, four succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, four injured persons have been confirmed as fatal casualty," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five workers were still missing, the army said, adding that six choppers had been deployed into rescue efforts as the "roads are blocked."
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the rescue teams were "continuously engaged in relief efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected in this hour of crisis," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have said climate change was making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state. (AFP)

<img alt="Five taxi fleets will hit the streets next Monday, with a range of electric vehicles on offer. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793790_1_20250301155137.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five taxi companies which were awarded licences to operate taxi fleets will roll out the long-awaited service next week, according to the secretary for transport and logistics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, Mable Chan added the fleets will serve customers with a range of new electric vehicles. She and the fleet operators will meet the press in an official launch ceremony on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi fleet regime was introduced last year as part of the government’s efforts to improve the sector's service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme drew keen interest with 15 applicants. Three of them did not meet the prescribed requirements, such as having a driver monitoring system and the provision of online hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining applicants were then vetted by an assessment panel, and five who emerged as winners were each granted a five-year licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also gave updates on the government’s push to adopt new energy vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Transport Department has approved 152 domestic and 409 international electric vehicle models as of the end of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier amendments to the Road Traffic Regulation meant to enable certain features of these vehicles also took effect today.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include remote parking, which Chan expects to be well-received by many drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's land resources are precious, with many parking spaces being quite compact. You may have seen videos showing skillful parking manoeuvres ... sometimes drivers even need to exit through the sunroof," she wrote.
