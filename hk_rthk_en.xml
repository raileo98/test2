  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday a large-scale medical evacuation was planned from Gaza this week, with more than 100 seriously ill and injured patients due to leave the war-ravaged territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The WHO said that, alongside its partners, it would evacuate as many as 113 patients on Wednesday, with most going to the United Arab Emirates and some heading to Romania for specialised care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If it goes ahead, it would be the largest evacuation from Gaza since October 2023, according to data from the UN health agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said he was hopeful the evacuation would go ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts were currently under way to bring patients from various hospitals across the Gaza Strip to the Gaza European Hospital near Khan Yunis in the south.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will be transported to the Kerem Shalom crossing on early Wednesday and then flown on to the UAE and Romania, Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva, via video link from Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those on the list figure among up to 14,000 people currently waiting in Gaza to be evacuated out of the territory for medical reasons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around half of them have sustained trauma injuries in the war and the others are suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the war in Gaza began following Hamas' deadly October 7, 2023 attack inside Israel, fewer than 5,000 people have been granted medical evacuations out of the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only 282 have meanwhile been able to leave since Israel shuttered Gaza's main Rafah border crossing in early May, Peeperkorn said, adding that around a third of them had been children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Peeperkorn lamented the "ad hoc" access to desperately-needed medical evacuations from Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we need is regular access... which would be properly supported, facilitated and not made unnecessarily dangerous," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need medical corridors, and the first medical corridor we basically request to be restored is the traditional referral pathway from Gaza to East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and... a second medical corridor to Egypt should be open again, and maybe to Jordan."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hamas's October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,391 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to Gaza health ministry figures which the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Labour Department (LD) said it was investigating a fatal industrial incident in Kowloon City in which a worker fell to his death while dismantling scaffolding at a building.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon, when the man fell onto the canopy on the first floor while dismantling a bamboo scaffold at the external wall of the building on Ma Tau Kok Road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was declared dead in hospital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department said it issued suspension notices to the contractors involved and stopped all scaffolding work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The contractors cannot resume the work until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," it wrote in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department added that it will try to find out what caused the incident and who might be responsible, and take legal actions if there is any violation of work safety legislation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union expressed regret over the tragedy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It urged employers to provide workers with safety equipment such as full-body safety harness and lifelines to prevent similar cases.

    'Oct saw most non-mainland visitors to HK this year'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Tuesday that Hong Kong recorded nearly a million arrivals of non-mainland visitors last month, the most so far this year for a single month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said total visitor arrivals in October topped 4 million, with non-mainland tourists exceeding 950,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first 10 months of the year, tourist arrivals reached 36.6 million, a 37 percent jump from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco panel meeting, lawmakers discussed the idea of promoting horse-racing tourism, which was included by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Third Side councillor Tik Chi-yuen expressed concerns that the move could encourage gambling, especially among the younger generation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said the aim is not to encourage people to gamble.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our target is the tourists... Horse-racing is an attractive event in their eyes," the secretary for culture, sports and tourism said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He described the SAR as the only place in the region that can host world-class, distinguished races.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the Kai Tak Sports Park which is set to come into use in the first quarter of 2025, Election Committee councillor Chan Siu-hung asked whether officials can ensure that shops and facilities near the park will enjoy a high usage rate during days when mega events are not being held.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan noted the nearby cruise terminal could go very quiet at times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said you can't compare the two. He said the sports park is a public facility, and individuals and groups can book and use the facilities there on non-game days.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Election Day voting began in the United States on Tuesday after an extraordinary, and for many unnerving, presidential race that will either make Kamala Harris the first woman president in the country's history or hand Donald Trump a comeback that sends shockwaves around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the first polling stations opened, Democratic vice president Harris, 60, and Republican former president Trump, 78, were dead-even in the tightest and most volatile White House contest of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bitter rivals spent their final day of the campaign frenetically working to get their supporters out to the polls and trying to win over any last undecided voters in the swing states expected to decide the outcome.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite a series of head-spinning twists in the campaign – from Harris's dramatic entrance when President Joe Biden dropped out in July, to Trump riding out two assassination attempts and a criminal conviction – nothing has broken the deadlock in the opinion polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Polling stations opened from 6.00am in states including Virginia, North Carolina and New York. Tens of millions of voters are expected to cast their ballots, on top of the more than 82 million people who have already voted early in the preceding weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A final outcome may not be known for several days if the results are as close as the polls suggest, adding to the tension in a deeply divided nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And there are fears of turmoil and even violence if Trump loses, and then contests the result as he did in 2020, with barriers erected around the White House and businesses boarded up in Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world is anxiously watching, as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East, for Russia's war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change which Trump calls a hoax.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris and Trump are effectively tied in the seven main swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the eve of the vote, Harris went all-in on the must-win state of Pennsylvania, rallying on the Philadelphia steps made famous in the "Rocky" movie and declaring: "momentum is on our side."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However "this could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," cautioned Harris, who was joined by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump, who would become the first convicted felon and oldest person to win the presidency, cast himself as the only solution to an apocalyptic vision of the country in terminal decline and overrun by "savage" migrants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," Trump told his closing rally in Grand Rapids in the key swing state of Michigan, after touring North Carolina and Pennsylvania. (AFP)

    'Preserve collective memory of Choi Hung Estate'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   District councillors have urged officials to think of ways to keep alive the heritage and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate, which is set to be redeveloped in three phases over about two decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first phase of the facelift for the rainbow-themed housing complex, built in the 1960s and famous for its colourful exterior wall and photogenic basketball court, involves three blocks and two vacant school sites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a Wong Tai Sin district council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the redevelopment plan, councillor Godfrey Ngai said the exterior wall and the basketball court should be preserved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We propose setting up a Choi Hung museum in the new [Choi Hung] estate, which would include the estate's existing iconic signage, retro vending machines and nostalgic items... This would help preserve the unique features and collective memory of Choi Hung Estate,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another councillor, Deannie Yew, said she is worried about the wall effect, after Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho revealed earlier that the blocks at the future estate will be over 50-storey high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If each building is going to be 50 storeys high, it would be like a 'giant' in the district because many buildings in the area aren't that tall. In such a densely populated area, wouldn't this potentially create the wall effect?" she questioned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, chief architect Tim Li from the Housing Department said a study has already taken the wall effect into consideration, and 50-storey designs are not new.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li added that each redevelopment cycle of Choi Hung Estate would take about seven years, which includes moving residents out, tearing down old buildings and building new foundations.

   Local stocks on Tuesday overcame early losses to finish more than 2 percent higher, thanks partly to fresh confidence towards the Chinese economy.

   The Hang Seng Index gained 439 points to 21,006, its highest finish in three weeks.

  <img alt="Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, says recent data on the city's economy and competitiveness show the SAR is full of opportunities.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Tuesday said the territory’s economic development has been recognised internationally and that the SAR has unlimited opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also hailed Chief Executive John Lee’s leadership in supporting the economy, seeking development opportunities and improving people’s livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong's economy has continued to expand. Its external economic and trade relations have also continued to improve. And the capital market is full of vitality," Zhou told the China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “These achievements have also been fully recognised and highly praised by the international community.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citing recent data on the city’s economy and competitiveness, Zhou added that Hong Kong is full of business opportunities and development potential.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said Beijing would continue to work with different departments to roll out measures beneficial to the SAR, while supporting cooperation between the city and Shanghai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong could become a financing platform for mainland enterprises. He said there are more than 2,000 mainland firms in the city with more than 1,400 listed on the city’s bourse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Among them were nearly 200 Shanghai companies that had a market value of more than HK$2 trillion. This fully demonstrates that Hong Kong can become an investment and financing platform serving the development of Shanghai and mainland enterprises," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We welcome more Shanghai and mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to go global and achieve mutual development."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee led a delegation that included Financial Secretary Paul Chan and commerce minister Algernon Yau to attend the seventh edition of the expo, where he toured the Hong Kong exhibition area and reported to Premier Li Qiang on the city's development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance chief, for his part, said Hong Kong is a prime treasury centre with a free flow of capital.

   RTHK has learnt that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong will hold a seminar on Hong Kong’s development in Shenzhen on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources have suggested Chief Executive John Lee, the director of Beijing’s liaison office Zheng Yanxiong, representatives of Hong Kong’s chambers of commerce and some international firms will participate in the seminar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last month, Xia met HSBC group chairman Mark Tucker, and expressed the hope that the bank could actively participate in the nation’s high-quality development, and contribute to Hong Kong’s prosperity and development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xia also met Jardine Matheson’s executive chairman Ben Keswick last week and said he hopes the group could help boost the international community’s understanding of Hong Kong.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made their final case on Monday in the hours before Election Day, when voters will either choose America's first woman president or hand the Republican an unprecedented comeback.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With polls showing a dead heat, Trump promised to lead the United States to "new heights of glory" while Harris said the "momentum is on our side", as the rivals held their last rallies of the 2024 race in crucial battleground states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Democratic Vice President finished on a high note in Philadelphia in the must-win state of Pennsylvania, with a rally on the steps immortalised by the boxing movie "Rocky". "This could be one of the closest races in history – every single vote matters," said Harris, who was joined by celebrities, including Lady Gaga and Oprah Winfrey.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also referenced the film, telling thousands of supporters that "here at these famous steps" she was paying "tribute to those who start as the underdog and climb to victory".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris, 60, has repeatedly said she is the underdog, having only joined the race three months ago after President Joe Biden dropped out. But she insisted she would win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former president Trump brought several family members up on stage at his closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America – indeed, the world – to new heights of glory," he told the crowd, as the clocks ticked over into Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump, 78, also called on people to turn up on election day, saying his supporters can "put ourselves in a position to win, which we can do very easily if we show up".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world is watching as the outcome will have major implications for conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, and for tackling climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And with Trump having narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July and police foiling a second alleged plot, the fears of violence are very real.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Washington, growing numbers of businesses and office buildings are being boarded up in case of unrest. (AFP)

    Labour group hopes for 5.5 percent pay rise next year

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions on Tuesday urged bosses to give their workers a raise of 5.5 percent next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group noted its recent survey of more than 1,100 workers showed that more than six out of ten interviewees got an average pay rise of 4.5 percent this year, while most of the rest saw their salaries frozen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over half of all respondents said they were unhappy with the salary adjustment, and over 70 percent think their pay should be adjusted based on inflation, the group said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The federation’s chairman Lam Chun-sing said the group had scaled back its expectations compared to last year after looking at factors such as inflation, the business situation and economic growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We suggest a salary increase of 5.5 percent, which is a little bit lower than last year because last year we suggested an increase of six percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Because last year the inflation was much higher than this year and also this year some of the sectors also face some challenges because of the economic situation.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam noted while the transportation sector saw bigger salary increases, some employees in industries like construction and catering faced a salary freeze.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think this is because of the economic situation... Also for the construction industry, some private construction projects are also delayed.”

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rank outsider Knight's Choice upset favourite Buckaroo on Tuesday to win the A$8 million (US$5.25 million) Melbourne Cup, earning Irish jockey Robbie Dolan a debut victory in Australia's "race that stops a nation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-year-old Australian-bred gelding came home by a nose in a photo finish ahead of Japanese raider Warp Speed and the Jamie Kah-ridden Okita Soushi in the energy-sapping two-mile handicap at Flemington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pinch me, I'm dreaming," said 28-year-old Dolan, a part-time singer who was riding in the famous race for the first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is incredible. I can't believe it. I don't even know what to say.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like I've ridden it 10 times because I have ridden it in my head 100 times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I can't put it into words. It is the biggest race in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a huge breakthrough for Dolan, who was previously best-known for appearing on The Voice, an Australian singing show.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'll be singing tonight after a few beers," he said, overcome with emotion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Buckaroo, priced as the A$7.00 favourite, finished ninth while the fancied Vauban could only manage 11th on a warm and sunny day, with the track firm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A cultural institution in Australia, the Melbourne Cup has been run since 1861 and is considered so important it is a public holiday in its host state of Victoria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Held in front of a bumper crowd, drinking and socialising took priority over racing for many, with the sound of popping champagne corks accompanying the thundering of hooves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Breaking from barrier six, the John Symons and Sheila Laxon-trained Knight's Choice, an 80-1 shot, settled towards the back of the 23-strong pack behind early leader Just Fine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With 1,000m to go, Just Fine was still ahead but was slowly reeled in down the home straight and finished last, with Knight's Choice surging from 20th at the final turn for a thrilling victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a second win for Laxon, who became the first woman to train a Melbourne Cup winner in 2001 with Ethereal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He did, he did," she said, lavishing praise on Dolan. "We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Symons added: "I was worried. He got further back than we talked about, but great ride. What a thrill. What a thrill."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mark Zahra, who rode the last two Melbourne Cup winners -- Without a Fight and Gold Trip -- was denied a hat-trick aboard Circle of Fire, finishing sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And Kerrin McEvoy's bid for a record-equalling fourth win was also unsuccessful, with his horse Absurde fifth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A record four women jockeys took part with Kah faring best on Okita Soushi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michelle Payne is the only woman rider to win the Melbourne Cup after she steered Prince of Penzance to victory in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was one withdrawal by stewards before the race started with French import Athabascan found to have an irregular heartbeat, reducing the field to 23. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea has fined Facebook-parent Meta more than US$15 million for illegally collecting sensitive user information from nearly a million people without consent and sharing it with advertisers, the country's data watchdog said on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm, which also owns Instagram, ran afoul of laws prohibiting the use of information on political opinions, religious beliefs and people's sex life unless the individual provides explicit consent, Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said that the tech giant collected sensitive information from around 980,000 domestic users in South Korea through their Facebook profiles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This included details about their religious beliefs and whether they are in a same-sex relationship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The watchdog said it had confirmed that such information was provided to advertisers by Meta, with around 4,000 advertisers using it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meta "analysed user behaviour data, including pages liked and ads clicked on Facebook", to create and implement targeted advertising related to "sensitive themes" such as transgender issues, homosexuality and North Korean defectors, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The commission said on Tuesday it had decided to fine Meta 21.6 billion won or US$15.6 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it "also ordered the company to establish legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond diligently to users' requests for access to their personal data". (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Harry Wilson struck twice in stoppage time to give Fulham a dramatic 2-1 victory over west London rivals Brentford on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vitaly Janelt had blasted the Bees in front against the run of play midway through the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fulham were frustrated until added time when substitute Wilson flicked home the equaliser and then head in a winner at the death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was an amazing feeling to come on and get the two goals to win the game. We deserved it, we kept them pinned in throughout," said Wilson.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victory lifts Marco Silva's men up to ninth and just three points off the top four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford had been headed for the top half themselves until the late turnaround, but instead remain in 12th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fulham failed to make the most of a purposeful start as Reiss Nelson was denied by Mark Flekken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford had barely threatened prior to going in front on 24 minutes when Janelt took aim from distance and fired a blistering shot past Bernd Leno.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emile Smith Rowe wasted a big chance to reply immediately and the home side struggled to break through Brentford's mass ranks of defence after half-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took until Fulham's 25th attempt on goal to beat Flekken, as Wilson's inventive effort looped over the Dutch goalkeeper from Adama Traore's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moments later, the Welsh international had a fortuitous second.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wilson's attempted header came off his shoulder to wrong-foot Flekken and flew into the top corner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They both went in, but not how I would have wanted" Wilson added. "The first one I just helped it on to the back post, and the second one was more lucky." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the airport’s three-runway system, which opens on November 28, will strengthen Hong Kong’s status as an aviation hub.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the Super Terminal Expo, Wong said the Hong Kong International Airport would be able to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually after the launch of the third runway, more than double the current figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the airport currently connects the SAR with nearly 200 global destinations, and that he expects airlines to make use of the new runway to introduce new routes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will make Hong Kong an even stronger aviation hub and allow us to serve the region and beyond even better. And for you as key stakeholders in the world's aviation and logistics communities, this means Hong Kong will provide you with a lot of business and profit opportunities," Wong said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The authorities] will proactively engage new and existing aviation partners, and markets in Belt and Road countries, including those in the Middle East and Asean."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Airport Authority said it successfully conducted safety checks at the airport in the past few months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Airport Authority continues to take forward the preparatory work for the commissioning of the three-runway system, including an aircraft crash and rescue exercise on the Centre Runway in the early hours of October 15," it wrote in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that the airport’s expanded Terminal 2 will be put into service in phases from the end of 2025.

  <img alt="Clevand's Darius Garland celebrates in the second half against the Milwaukee Bucks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777618_1_20241105115319.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Darius Garland poured in 39 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers fended off a late Milwaukee surge to beat the Bucks 116-114 on Monday and push their perfect NBA record to 8-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Garland drilled a step-back three-pointer to put Cleveland up 113-111 with 45 seconds to play, then fed Jarrett Allen for a dagger layup as the Cavs, who led by as many as 19 in the second quarter, matched the franchise's best start to a season – also achieved in 1976.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's hard to get one win, so eight is crazy," Garland said. "I'm happy we got eight – we've got to keep this thing going."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bucks, with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out with an adductor strain, dropped their sixth straight game – coming up short again after a one-point home loss to the Cavs on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Milwaukee point guard Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 36 points in the third quarter as the Bucks battled back to lead 91-89 heading into the fourth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They pushed the lead to eight points midway through the fourth, but a three-pointer from Garland ignited a 10-0 scoring run that put the Cavs up by two. Lillard would briefly put Milwaukee back in front but the Cavs had enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Evan Mobley added 17 points and Allen finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and a massive block on Lillard with eight seconds to play that sealed the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We had to fight for 48 minutes," Garland said. "We knew they were going to come out in the second half and try to be more aggressive – it was a great all-around team effort."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a busy night that saw every team in action before a pause for the US presidential election on Tuesday, the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers 115-103 while the reigning champion Boston Celtics romped past the Hawks 123-93 in Atlanta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Golden State Warriors welcomed Stephen Curry back from a three-game injury absence with a 125-112 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 17 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the third triple-double of his career and Jaden Ivey scored 26 points to power the Pistons to their third win of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anthony Davis scored 37 points for the Lakers, but appeared to be troubled by a left foot or ankle injury in the fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James scored 20 points with eight rebounds and 11 assists, but the Pistons seized the lead in the first quarter and remained in control the rest of the way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Warriors led all the way in Washington, with Curry scoring a team-high 24 points in his first game since he tweaked his left ankle on October 27. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

    North Korea stages more missile launches

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbours said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the US presidential election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometres with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including US military bases there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the US mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo-jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the US presidential election to command the attention of Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new US president is elected. (AP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China must combat rising unilateralism by opening up further to trade and investment, Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country will look to upgrade its free trade zones and further explore free trade and investment agreements with other countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In the face of the current impasses of global development, no one can stay unaffected and no one can solve these problems on their own,” Li said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Only by steadfastly embracing openness and cooperation and working together in unity can we harness the immense strength of all humanity to collectively to foster global development and prosperity.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also expressed confidence over the nation's ability to meet its growth target and its economic prospects in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his speech, Li pointed out there have been many positive developments in the nation’s economy indicating a favourable outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities also had fiscal and monetary tools at their disposal, he added. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Nelly Korda has clinched her first LPGA Player of the Year honors, the LPGA confirmed on Monday after it became mathematically impossible for anyone to catch her for the points-based award.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an already historic 2024 campaign America's Korda has six victories and three additional top-10 finishes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her wins included a record-equalling run of five straight capped by her second major title at the Chevron Championship, and she represented the United States at the Paris Olympics and in the Solheim Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Korda skipped two tournaments on the recent Asian swing after a neck injury limited her ability to practice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ayaka Furue of Japan, winner of the Evian Championship in July, would have had to win the rest of the LPGA events this year to catch up, but tied for 10th in the Japan Classic on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Winning the Rolex Player of the Year means so much to me," the 26-year-old Korda said in a statement. "This season has had its highs and challenges, and I'm just really grateful for the people around me who have helped me get here."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Korda is expected to tee it up in two more tournaments this year, including the season-ending Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, from November 21 to 24. (AFP)

    Kowloon City court ramps up security

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Security at Kowloon City court on Tuesday was ramped up a day after a man was arrested for allegedly attempting to attack a magistrate who had earlier convicted him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The judiciary said it will “progressively implement enhanced security measures”, such as bag screenings and deploying extra manpower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An RTHK reporter at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts saw security personnel asking people to open their bags for inspections outside courtrooms. People were asked to empty their water bottles and sharp objects were not allowed in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If these items are discovered, we will call the police,” a notice displayed at the screening area read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a courtroom mainly hearing criminal cases, roughly three security guards were present and about four police officers were in the dock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On floors without courtrooms, security checks were not required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources suggest Edward Wong was the magistrate who was allegedly targeted as court proceedings were underway on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The court diary on the judiciary’s website showed Wong was not presiding over any cases on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts, where national security cases are heard, there are no walk-through metal detectors and people are not asked to empty their pockets at the Kowloon City courthouse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, police have laid a holding charge against a man, 32, suspected of involvement in Monday's attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case will be mentioned at Kowloon City Magistracy on Wednesday morning.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Olympic 100-metre champion Noah Lyles is not one of the two finalists for male track athlete of the year, World Athletics revealed on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lyles won one of the closest Olympic finals in history to take gold in Paris in August by five thousandths of a second from Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lyles misses out as 200-metre Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Norway's 5,000-metre gold medallist Jakob Ingebrigtsen were the two male track athletes to make the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The American was aiming for an Olympic sprint double but had to settle for the 200m bronze medal behind Tebogo and his US teammate Kenny Bednarek.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lyles later revealed he had raced in the 200-metre despite testing positive for Covid-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In contrast, the winner of the Olympic women's 100-metre final, Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, is one of the two women's track finalists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She will be up against Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the American who broke her own world record to win the Olympic 400-metre hurdles title for a second time in a row.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World Athletics said the top two in each category – track, field and out of stadium – were chosen from a first round of voting, which comprised votes from the World Athletics Council, officials and dignitaries connected to the sport known as the "World Athletics Family", and a public vote on social media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a new addition to this year's awards, a final round of votes cast by fans of the sport from Monday until November 10 will decide the overall World Athlete of the Year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the field events, Olympic men's pole vault champion and world record holder Mondo Duplantis will be hot favourite to take the men's award.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Swede is up against Miltiadis Tentoglou of Greece, who won the men's long jump gold in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who broke the 37-year-old women's world record with a clearance of 2.10-metre four weeks before taking Olympic gold, will go head-to-head with three-time Olympic heptathlon champion Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The women's out-of-stadium award pits world marathon record holder Ruth Chepng'etich of Kenya against Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won the Olympic marathon in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the men's category Brian Pintado, the Ecuadorean gold medallist in the 20-kilometre race walk at the Paris Games, will compete against Olympic men's marathon champion Tamirat Tola from Ethiopia. (AFP)

  <img alt="Sabalenka during her group-stage match against Paolini. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777575_1_20241105081016.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aryna Sabalenka has secured qualification for the semi-finals stage of the WTA Finals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Jasmine Paolini, as Zheng Qinwen ended Elena Rybakina's chances of moving on in Riyadh on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two round-robin wins in as many matches this week in Saudi Arabia, Sabalenka guaranteed herself passage to the final four as the winner of the Purple Group.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Belarusian top seed is also just one victory away from locking down the year-end number one ranking, which she is in a direct battle with Iga Swiatek.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka bounced back from 0-2 down in the second set, and saved two set points at 4-5 to overcome Italian fourth seed Paolini and has now won 22 of her last 23 matches on tour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The second set was quite tricky. Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and show her that I'm going to fight for this set no matter what and I'm really happy I was able to win in straight sets," said Sabalenka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Halfway through the second set I was already thinking about the third set," she added. "But I was like, wait, wait, it's not the third set until it's the third set – I'm happy all those shots on set points went in."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chinese Olympic medallist improved her chances of advancing to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number five Rybakina.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The seventh-seeded Zheng rebounded from her opening round-robin defeat to Sabalenka by claiming her first win from three meetings with Rybakina.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rybakina suffered her second defeat of the week in Saudi Arabia, and has no chance of reaching the semi-finals – with one more round-robin clash to go against Sabalenka on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zheng apologised to the crowd during her on-court interview for yelling, 'Don't shout more', at some of her supporters at a crucial moment in the final set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She thanked them for their support and later acknowledged she could have handled the moment better.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I felt today in such an important moment, when they shout so hard my name, my heart rate goes up. So I hold and hold, until one moment I can't hold more," Zheng said during her post-match press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm feeling a bit bad, because if I can control my emotions a bit better, I was supposed not to say that to my crowd."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zheng arrived in Riyadh on the back of an impressive second half of the season that saw her win titles in Palermo and Tokyo, and an Olympic gold medal in singles in Paris. No woman has won more matches than her within that span.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first Chinese player to qualify for the WTA Finals since Li Na in 2013, Zheng amassed a 12-2 win-loss record during the Asian swing last month and is the tour leader in most aces struck and percentage of first-serve points won.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chinese Olympic champion now owns a tour-leading 20 three-set wins in 2024 – the highest tally by a WTA player in a single season since 2016. (AFP)

    New prostate cancer therapy could save lives

  <img alt="Doctor Kenneth Wong (right) said around one in two patients who receive the new treatment will see their tumour shrink or eliminated altogether.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   There may be fresh hope for prostate cancer patients who develop resistance to traditional forms of therapies, as oncologists say a new third-line treatment is showing promising results so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology said the targeted radiotherapy treatment -- lutetium-177-PSMA-617 -- can boost cancer survival rates and improve patients' quality of life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Half of the patients also reported a reduction in tumour size, while others had cancer cells completely eradicated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The treatment is used when the patient no longer reacts to both hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, and presents symptoms such as difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, and even spinal cord pain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Clinical oncologist Kenneth Wong said the treatment is also associated with less side effects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certainly some side effects associated with the use of this drug, including dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, anaemia and so on," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But that was still better than traditional chemotherapy, Wong stressed, in which patients had to deal with suppressed bone marrow function and an increased risk of infection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The theranostic medicine is administered intravenously every six weeks, for up to six sessions. It locates cancer cells in the body and delivers targeted radiation to kill those cells.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said patients are required to drink large amounts of water to purge the remnants of the drug which are not absorbed by the tumour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They should also avoid close contact with people for up to two weeks, especially children and pregnant women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each injection costs HK$100,000 and public hospital patients have to pay out of their own pockets. Charity group St James' Settlement currently provides a subsidy of up to HK$30,000 for each treatment programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer among men in Hong Kong in 2021. More than half of the patients were only diagnosed at an advanced stage.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed slightly lower after a choppy session on Monday, as investors prepared for a crucial week in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve will release a policy statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both scrambled for an edge in the last full day of a race that polls show as extremely close. It could take days to determine the victor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some of the so-called "Trump trades" unwound after a recent poll showed Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading in Iowa, sparking a drop in the US dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin. Trump Media & Technology Group closed up 12.4 percent, bouncing back from early losses of nearly 6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, to 41,794, the S&P 500 lost 16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,712 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,179.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors were largely pricing in a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points at its policy announcement on Thursday, with CME's FedWatch Tool showing markets pricing in a 98 percent chance of a cut, with only a 2 percent chance the central bank keeps rates steady.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors was energy, up 1.9 percent as oil prices climbed after OPEC+ decided to delay plans for an output increase. (Reuters)

    Putin meets North Korean foreign minister

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Putin met North Korea's foreign minister in the Kremlin on Monday amid mounting concern in the West that North Korean soldiers are about to enter the Ukraine war on Moscow's side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Video of the meeting showed the pair shaking hands for a full minute as Putin greeted Choe Son Hui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin noted that they were meeting on Russia's National Unity Day, a public holiday, and Choe conveyed "sincere, warm, comradely greetings" from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States says North Korea has sent some 10,000 troops to Russia, including 8,000 to the western Kursk region where Russia is still battling to expel Ukrainian troops who broke across the border in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin, who signed a treaty with Kim in June that includes a mutual defence clause, has neither confirmed nor denied the North Korean troop presence. He has said that Russia is free to implement the pact as it sees fit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian leader briefly alluded to the military situation in Kursk when he met youth volunteers earlier on Monday, telling them: "When the enemy is cleaned out from the region, there will be lots of work for you to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the "need for decisive action" in response to North Korean involvement in the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said North Korean troops were waging "an aggressive war in Europe against a sovereign European state".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week urged Kyiv's allies to stop just "watching" and start taking action to tackle the presence of the North Koreans. (Reuters)

    EU and South Korea discuss security issues

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The dispatch of North Korean troops to Russia as Moscow wages war in Ukraine highlights the need for security cooperation between the European Union and South Korea, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The deployment "regrettably illustrates the importance of our shared security agenda," he said before talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Seoul. The EU and South Korea are holding their first Strategic Dialogue meeting after Washington and Seoul sounded the alarm about North Korea sending troops to help Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Borrell also met South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun and expressed concern over the development, the South Korean defence ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an existential threat," Borrell said in a post on X and also posted a photo of him shaking hands with Kim. "The Republic of Korea is best positioned to understand it. We are united in our support to Ukraine. I encouraged them to step it up."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Borrell said in a post on X on Sunday that he had visited the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas after arriving in South Korea following a trip to Japan, and described the visit as reminder of the need to invest more in peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said in another post that he was visiting South Korea to take security and defence cooperation between the EU and Seoul to "the next level", but gave no further details. Cho said last week that all possible scenarios were under consideration, when asked about whether Seoul could send weapons to Ukraine in response to North Korea aiding Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine, including mine clearance equipment, but has resisted Kyiv's requests for weapons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul also sees it as likely that the North will be compensated by Moscow with military and civilian technology, as it races to launch a spy satellite and upgrade its missile capabilities. North Korea last week flexed its military muscle with the test of a huge new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile dubbed Hwasong-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington expects North Korean troops in Russia's Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, to enter the fight against Ukraine soon, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At talks in Moscow on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country intended to back Russia until it achieves victory in the Ukraine war. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia will spend A$600 million (US$395 million) on defence reserve recruitment and extending a cash bonus to retain troops as the centre-left Albanese government seeks to overcome workforce shortages, officials are expected to announce on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A review of Australia's defence force last year identified severe workforce pressures as a priority issue, even as the government lifts its defence budget to a record A$51.5 billion annually, revamping its northern military bases and acquiring long range strike capabilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A defence workforce plan expected to be released on Tuesday cites a competitive national labour market and record low levels of unemployment as putting pressure on defence's ability to recruit, according to excerpts viewed by Reuters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bonus scheme introduced last year will be extended until 2028 and expanded through the middle ranks, offering A$40,000 to defence force members who stay to "address hollowness in the force", the plan says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Defence aims to achieve a permanent defence workforce of 69,000 by the early 2030s, with an overall combined defence and civilian workforce of around 100,000 by 2040, the plan says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June, there were around 57,000 permanent defence personnel, falling short of funded positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our ADF personnel are our greatest capability, which is why it is crucial that the Defence workforce has the people it needs to help protect Australia’s strategic interests," Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia is spending up to A$368 billion to acquire nuclear powered submarines under the Aukus partnership with the United States and Britain, and has also allocated A$74 billion for missile systems, as it responds to rising tensions with China in the Indo Pacific region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, Australia cancelled a multibillion-dollar military satellite project with Lockheed Martin, saying it would instead shift its focus to a multi-orbit system to increase resilience for the Australian Defence Force. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Fanling Magistrates' Court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old mainland student to three months in jail for using fake academic credentials to apply for a master's degree programme at a Hong Kong university.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said the man had passed an online interview for the Health and Physical Education programme at Education University, and received a conditional offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was then asked to submit his qualifications, including an English proficiency test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Upon verification the institution realised the actual score attained by the applicant did not match his claim, and reported the case to police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man pleaded guilty to a count of attempting to obtain services by deception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police warned people against using bogus academic qualifications, saying it will adopt a zero-tolerance approach to maintain the reputation of Hong Kong's higher education.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Education officials on Monday said the results of this year’s Territory-wide System Assessment (TSA), which tests students on the subjects of Chinese, English and maths, remained “generally steady”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Primary three students’ scores were all slightly down this year in all the subjects, with an 80.9 percent, 78.7 percent, and 85.3 percent proficiency in Chinese, English and maths respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secondary three pupils did better in Chinese and maths this year, but their English proficiency was down from last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As compared to that of last year, the performance of the primary three and secondary three students participating in the assessment of the three major subjects of Chinese Language, English Language and mathematics this year remains generally steady," the Education Bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it will use different ways to help enhance learning and teaching effectiveness.

  <img alt='Often inhaled through vapes, "space oil" usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that can only be prescribed by a doctor.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A pharmacist on Monday said regulations on short-acting anaesthetics were not strong enough to deter their recreational use.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong has this year recorded at least three deaths caused by the suspected usage of “space oil”, according to the Toxicology Reference Laboratory of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Often inhaled through vapes, “space oil” usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor. The anaesthetic is classified as a Part 1 poison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Hong Kong So Yiu-wah said the long-term use of etomidate could be deadly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The drug will suppress the cortisol level inside our body. Once the cortisol is lowered, then our blood potassium will also be lowered, making muscles, especially the legs, seem very weak," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because the potassium level is low, the heartbeat may become irregular. If those people already have some heart disease, it may be even fatal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said penalties for the illegal use of the drug are not stringent enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The penalty is high not enough, because for those people who violate the [regulation], the maximum penalty is a HK$100,000 [fine] and being kept in jail for two years,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is seeking to list the sedative as a dangerous drug in the first half of 2025, according to security minister Chris Tang, who also said taking “space oil” would be equivalent to taking drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If etomidate is listed as a dangerous drug, those illegally possessing or consuming “space oil” containing the substance would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Monday arrested a man who allegedly attempted to attack a magistrate with a knife inside Kowloon City Magistrates’ Courts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case took place shortly after 10am, when the court was in session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As proceedings were under way, the 32-year-old suspect allegedly emerged from the public gallery and charged towards the magistrate, while pulling out a knife from his bag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A police officer intervened quickly and the man never got to the magistrate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man then tried to flee the scene but was subdued outside the courtroom. Three officers suffered minor injuries in the process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Superintendent Gar Kam-lam told reporters at a briefing that the man was carrying four knives of 27 to 46cm long, as well as flammable liquids and lighters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gar also confirmed the suspect was convicted of indecent assault in 2020, and was awaiting appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He brought along documents and papers which suggested he was upset with the ruling," Gar said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sources suggest Edward Wong was the presiding magistrate for that case. The same magistrate was at the court this morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are currently no security checks at most of the city's Magistrates' Courts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The judiciary said it will "progressively implement enhanced security measures" from Tuesday, including screenings and extra manpower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will also liaise with police on strengthening patrols and ensure the safety of judges, judicial officers, court staff and users.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Justice strongly condemned the case, saying any threat to judicial officers’ personal safety cannot be tolerated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bar Association, for its part, also condemned the case "in the strongest possible terms".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said any threat or violent act made with the intent to frighten or pressure judicial officers, or retaliate against their decisions is a serious assault on judicial independence.
   <br/>

  <img alt="Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic "Thriller" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died on Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing," the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalogue that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for "Roots" and "In the Heat of the Night," organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honours likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The list of his honours and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Centre tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Director of Water Supplies on Monday said officials are investigating what caused a pipe burst that resulted in a water outage in Tung Chung, and apologised to those affected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tung Chung was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours because urgent repairs on a 1.2 metre-diameter pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities said they originally planned to turn the taps back on at 6am on Monday, but fresh water only returned to Tung Chung at 10am.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, Roger Wong apologised to the 120,000 affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the site constraints, and also because of the special failure mode of this incident, we take time to investigate and find out the leakage point,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The leakage point is also at the bottom of the pipe, so it is hard to carry out the repair works. That's why the progress of [repair] works has been slightly delayed."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong added more time was needed to find out the exact cause and a report will be submitted to the Development Bureau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Built in the 1990s, the burst water pipe is the only one servicing the Tung Chung area.

    Exchange Fund sees record income for first nine months

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

    Morales vows to continue his defiance of Bolivian govt

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bolivia's former President Evo Morales insisted on Sunday that he would press on with a hunger strike until the government of his protégé-turned-rival agreed to a political dialogue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales' supporters have blocked roads and caused disruptions around the country in protest against what they say is the government's political persecution of the former Bolivian leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a larger-than-life figure still towering over Bolivian politics five years after his ouster, spoke on his third day without food from Chapare, Bolivia’s rural coca-growing region that serves as his stronghold.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “My fight is to improve the situation in the country and to start a dialogue without conditions on two fronts, one economic and one political,” Morales told reporters from the office of the coca growers’ federation that he long has led.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former president said he began his hunger strike on Friday in the hope that "international organisations or friendly governments" would facilitate talks with his political nemesis, President Luis Arce .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tensions have surged over the past three weeks since pro-Morales supporters set up crippling roadblocks aimed at rebuking Arce — Morales' former economy minister with whom he is now vying to lead Bolivia’s governing socialist party into next year’s elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since mid-October, protesters have choked off major highways in defiance of an attempt by Arce's government to revive a 2016 statutory rape case against Morales, an ethnic Aymara who was the first member of an indigenous community to become the president of Latin America’s only indigenous-majority nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, the disruptions in transport have cost the South American country more than US$1.7 billion, according to Bolivia's government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales has denied any wrongdoing and rejects the charges as politically motivated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “My crime is being indigenous,” he said on Sunday. (AP)

    SAR a hub for legal collaboration: justice chief

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong’s justice secretary on Monday said the SAR is well positioned to be a hub for legal and economic collaboration, with Beijing saying it will give its unwavering support to back the SAR in its role as a super-connector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the opening of Hong Kong Legal Week, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said the SAR serves as a gateway between China, the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the One Country, Two Systems principle, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within China. Our strong legal foundation, coupled with our close ties with and support from the mainland, position us as a critical hub for legal and economic collaboration across the region and beyond," Lam said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also said efforts to set up a training academy for international legal talents are underway, with a ceremony set to take place on Friday to mark the new initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academy – first outlined in last year’s Policy Address – will regularly organise training courses, seminars and international exchange programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also speaking at the event, Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry’s Office in Hong Kong Cui Jianchun, said the central government’s unwavering commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle is the strongest foundation for the territory’s development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He called on the SAR to continue to boost its unique role as a super-connector to facilitate trade and investment between Chinese and foreign enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another role that the territory could play, Cui noted, would be uniting diverse market participants and expanding international connections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe Hong Kong's uniqueness not only serves and links the mainland with the international community, [but also] we believe here, the common law, the unique law system, can pave the way for the development of the international community."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The commissioner added the SAR could act as a bridge for multicultural interactions, facilitating legal assistance and cooperation, as well as the exchange of legal experience.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least six people died after a volcano in eastern Indonesia erupted several times overnight, officials said on Monday, raising the alert level to the highest of a four-tiered system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, located on the popular tourist island of Flores, spewed a tower of ash and lava on nearby villages that were forced to evacuate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to our coordination with the local authorities, six fatalities have been confirmed," Abdul Muhari, spokesman of the country's disaster management agency said on Monday in an interview on Kompas TV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Video clips showed villages near the volcano covered by thick ash, with some areas on fire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's volcanology agency raised the alert level to the highest mark, and told locals and tourists not to carry out activities within a seven-kilometre radius of the crater.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There has been a significant increase in volcanic activity on Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki," it said in a press release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It warned there was a potential for rain-induced lava floods and told locals to wear masks to avoid the effects of volcanic ash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mountain had several major eruptions in January, prompting authorities at the time to raise the alert status to the highest level and evacuate at least 2,000 residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesia, a vast archipelago nation, experiences frequent eruptions due to its position on the Pacific "Ring of Fire", an area of intense volcanic and seismic activity. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A tense battle in Seattle saw the Los Angeles Rams come away with a 26-20 overtime NFL win on Demarcus Robinson's one-handed catch of a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seahawks had scored on a 14-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but could not score on the opening drive of the extra session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the Rams needing only a field goal after stuffing the Seahawks on fourth down on the first possession of overtime, Stafford went for the win by throwing a deep ball to Robinson, who was well covered by cornerback Riq Woolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams, who have now won three straight after losing four of their previous five.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions dominated the Green Bay Packers in a 24-14 victory at rain-lashed Lambeau Field on Sunday, winning the battle for supremacy in the NFC North division.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Detroit's Kerby Joseph returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown to help the Lions take control in the highly anticipated matchup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Green Bay struck for an early field goal, but the Lions took the lead for good when quarterback Jared Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown with a three-yard touchdown pass in the first minute of the second quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added a field goal and a touchdown in the final minute of the first half as Joseph reeled in a pass from an under-pressure Packers quarterback Jordan Love and raced up the sideline to the end zone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Detroit scored 24 points before the Packers produced a second field goal. A late Green Bay touchdown made the score more respectable, but the Lions were in control throughout as they improved to 7-1 – the best record in the NFC – for the first time since 1956.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a fun game," Goff said. "In Green Bay, in Lambeau, we're supposed to be the 'dome team' – we're supposed to be the team that can't play outside – and we came in here and win." (AFP/AP)

    Tung Chung fresh water supply restored

  <img alt="The Water Supplies Department says it ordered water trucks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777463_1_20241104104544.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Authorities on Monday said that water supply to Tung Chung was restored shortly after 10am, after the area was cut off from fresh water for about 12 hours due to urgent overnight repairs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Water Supplies Department had originally planned to restore the supply of water at 6am but was forced to delay it several times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islands District Councillor Lau Chin-pang told RTHK the arrangements were unsatisfactory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think the delay is not good for our residents because 7am to 8am is the most important time for the students and for the workers. So I don't think it's a suitable case. I think they can improve,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Huizaifa, a food delivery worker who lives in Yat Tung Estate in Tung Chung, was one of the affected residents.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Now I go to work [but there was] just a little water only [for] face wash… I feel very bad because when I came home, no water and when I go toilet no [water]” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a wet market, an angry congee shop owner surnamed Fu said no water meant no business.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Of course the water outage has a huge impact, affecting the whole world. It makes things very inconvenient. Everything needs water. Even if you want to eat, there’s nothing to eat. So there’s no business,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department said earlier that it ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the repairs for the 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe were needed following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho, and Discovery Bay.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand captain Tom Latham on Sunday said his team's 3-0 Test sweep in India was one of the "greatest series wins" for the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Black Caps won the third Test by 25 runs on Sunday at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to hand India only their second series whitewash at home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand – cricket's perennial underdogs – turned around their fortunes from a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka in September to make India suffer their first Test series loss at home in 12 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand cricket, probably one of New Zealand cricket's greatest series wins I think," said Latham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Again, all we can do is keep playing cricket and keep playing our brand of cricket," he added. "We've felt a lot of support over the last couple of weeks, which is really special."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand host England for three Tests starting November 28 in Christchurch followed by matches in Wellington and Hamilton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got three more big games back home," said Latham. "We've got sell-out crowds in a couple of the games – which is all you can ask for from a cricketer's point of view."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mumbai-born New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel stood out in the final Test with a match-haul of 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He took five in the first innings and then six to help bowl out India for 121 in their chase of 147 and Latham praised his match-winner as "fantastic". (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Three-time world champion Max Verstappen produced a virtuoso drive in often atrocious conditions to regain control of this year's world championship on Sunday when he charged from 17th on the grid to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Without a win in 10 races since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Red Bull's series leader made light of the chaotic, rain-swept conditions to register a 62nd career triumph and fastest lap while nearest title rival Lando Norris of McLaren went from pole position to sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dutchman's triumph lifted him to 393 points, increasing his advantage over Norris, on 331, to 62 with just three Grands Prix and one sprint race remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen finished 19.477 seconds ahead of Alpine's French duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly with Mercedes' George Russell fourth and Charles Leclerc fifth for Ferrari in a tumultuous contest of accidents, two red-flag stoppages, penalties and planned post-race investigations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Alpine, the reward was a leap from ninth to sixth in the constructors championship, reportedly valued at an estimated US$50 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris, who struggled to find his usual pace, came home sixth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB's Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen's success came on the day he overhauled Michael Schumacher's record of leading the drivers standings for 896 days while many of his rivals faced post-race investigations for various sporting misdemeanours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My emotions have been a rollercoaster today – that unlucky qualifying and starting 17th made it such a tough race, but we stayed out of trouble, made the right calls and it is unbelievable to win here from so far back," said Verstappen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What a day," said a beaming Ocon. "After this difficult season, it's so nice to drive here and the rain levelled out the performance so I am very happy." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I knew I had to play like this to win today," said Zverev, who opened his victory speech by apologising to the crowd at Paris' Bercy Arena.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to congratulate Ugo on an incredible week, he's an incredible player,": he added. "If you continue like this, you'll be able to lift trophies like this. This is not your last chance, Ugo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev's victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the season-ending showpiece.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to congratulate Zverev for the quality of the tennis he has played all this week, and season," said Humbert.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I came as a kid to watch matches at the Paris Masters, and it made me want to do what I do," he added. "So I'm very happy to have reached the final." (AFP)

    Pro-EU Sandu claims victory in Moldova election

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Moldova’s Western-friendly President Maia Sandu won a second term in a presidential runoff against her opponent who was seen as preferring closer ties with Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a race which was overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With nearly 99 percent of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held on Sunday, Sandu had 55 percent of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared with 45 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result will be a major relief to those who backed Sandu’s candidacy and her push for Moldova becoming a member of the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She went on to claim that her country's vote had faced an “unprecedented attack" through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country" and criminal groups.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not clear if he had publicly commented on his electoral defeat. (AP)

    Angry crowds throw mud at Spain's king in Valencia

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Furious locals hurled mud and insults at Spain's king, queen and prime minister on Sunday in a startling show of anger in the worst hit town in the flood disaster that has killed more than 210 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More heavy rain fell on the Valencia region after King Felipe VI, Queen Letizia and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were forced to leave Paiporta where more than 70 people died in floods last Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mud hit the monarchs in the face and clothes as they tried to calm the angry crowd in scenes that underscored the fury over the response to the disaster that has now killed at least 217 people with many more still missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The king and queen went to a crisis centre in Paiporta. But extra security guards soon had to keep the angry crowd away from the royals and prime minister. They put up umbrellas to stop mud hitting the royal couple.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The king said later that Spain had to "understand the anger and frustration" of people affected by the devastation to towns where cars have been left in muddy heaps in streets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a social media video, the king called on the public to give the victims "hope and their guarantee that the state in its entirety is present".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the fury seemed directed at Prime Minister Sanchez and Valencia regional government head Carlos Mazon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I understand the social anger and of course, I'm here to receive it. This is my political and moral obligation," Mazon said in a post on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rear window of Sanchez's car was broken before he and the local politicians quickly left. The socialist leader said that while he empathised with the "anguish and suffering" of the victims, he condemned "all forms of violence".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency services on Sunday listed 213 dead in the Valencia region, one in Andalusia in the south and three in Castilla-La Mancha neighbouring Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have warned the toll could rise as vehicles trapped in tunnels and underground car parks are cleared. (AFP)

    Shenzhou-18 crew returns to Earth

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-18 manned mission returned to Earth early on Monday after more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu are "in good physical condition," after touching down in the return capsule of their Shenzhou spaceship at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After leaving the capsule, the trio thanked the country and the people, saying they hope to continue contributing to the country's space programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Manned Space Agency described the mission as "a complete success".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future," Ye said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Cong, who has just completed his first-ever space adventure, said that the crew was united as one and worked closely with the ground team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Guangsu also returned from his first spaceflight. "We have all enjoyed the unique experience of weightlessness. It is exciting to return to Earth, but we are also unwilling to part the wonders of the space," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trio later arrived in Beijing by plane. They will enter a period of medical quarantine and undergo comprehensive medical examinations and health evaluations, and meet with the press afterwards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The three men had travelled to Tiangong in late April and were met on October 30 by three new astronauts, with whom they conducted a five-day handover before making their return journey.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing earlier said it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A top Slovak mountaineer died on a descent of the 7,234-metre Langtang Lirung peak in Nepal after an historic ascent up its east face, Slovakia's climbers association said on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ondrej Huserka, a member of the Slovak national mountaineering team who had climbed in the Alps, Patagonia, Pamir Mountains and Himalayas, fell into a crevasse on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His Czech climbing partner Marek Holecek said that the pair had just completed the first-ever ascent of the Langtang Lirung peak via the east face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Slovak climbers association SHS James called for rescue action on Facebook but then said on Sunday that the helicopter could not take off because of bad weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holecek confirmed the death in an emotional post on Facebook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said Huserka had "hit an angled surface after an eight-metre drop, then continued down a labyrinth into the depths of the glacier".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holecek added that he had spent hours trying to rescue Huserka but failed as the Slovak was trapped head down and apparently paralysed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I rappelled down to him and stayed with him for four hours until his light faded. There's nothing more to add," Holecek said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SHS James said that the weather in Nepal would prevent rescue action in the days to come.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Following a phone call with Marek Holecek and his status published yesterday, and given the weather conditions under Langtang Lirung, the family and friends will have to cope with the fact that Ondrej is not with us any more," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Slovak daily SME described the 34-year-old Huserka as "one of the best Slovak mountaineers" who focused on rock and ice climbing. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Europe will need to rethink its support of Ukraine if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Sunday, as the continent "will not be able to bear the burdens of the war alone".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Orban opposes military aid to Ukraine and has made clear he thinks Trump shares his views and would negotiate a peace settlement for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He backs former president Trump, the Republican candidate, to beat Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in Tuesday's US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We (in Europe) need to realise that if there will be a pro-peace president in America, which I not only believe in but I also read the numbers that way... if what we expect happens and America becomes pro-peace, then Europe cannot remain pro-war," Orban said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine will be high on the agenda when European leaders meet in Budapest in the coming week, he said, referring to a European Political Community meeting and a more informal meeting of EU leaders due to take place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Europe cannot bear the burden of [the war] alone, and if Americans switch to peace, then we also need to adapt, and this is what we will discuss in Budapest," Orban said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Europe is jittery about how the outcome of the US election will affect the war in Ukraine and the continent's security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Orban has angered Brussels with his close ties to Russia and opposition to aid for Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said in July that the Hungarian government sees Trump as a "chance for peace" in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In July, Orban said his team was assisting Trump's aides with policies on families and migration. On Thursday, he called Trump to wish him good luck ahead of Tuesday's election. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia on Sunday claimed to have captured another Ukrainian village, just a dozen kilometres from the key eastern logistics hub Pokrovsk, as its troops advance rapidly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian defence ministry said it had "liberated the settlement of Vichneve following offensive operations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russia has been making swift advances in the eastern Donetsk region for weeks, taking dozens of towns and villages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, Moscow said its forces had captured the large village of Kurakhivka close to the industrial town of Kurakhove, which Russia is also aiming to capture, and the small village of Pershotravneve in the Kharkiv region close to the eastern Lugansk region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capturing Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub for Ukraine that connects several fortresses in the Donbas, is one of Russia's main objectives in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is also home to a major coke coal mine that is crucial to Ukraine's steel production for its military.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian troops have advanced to just a few kilometres outside the town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Russian army took 478 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory in October, according to an AFP analysis of data from the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That marks a record since the first weeks of the conflict in March 2022. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Urgent repair work is taking place on a pipe that provides fresh water to Tung Chung, after water supplies were suspended to the area at 10pm on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Water Supplies Department says water supply to the area will gradually resume on Monday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department said the repairs were needed to a 1,200-millimetre-diameter fresh-water pipe following an operational incident near the Siu Ho Wan Water Treatment Works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A department document said the works is a key facility to supply water to Tung Chung, Hong Kong International Airport, Tai Ho and Discovery Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials have cordoned off part of Cheung Tung Road to make the repairs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department said it has ordered water trucks and water tanks to the area to provide a temporary supply of fresh water to residents and businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it has contacted the Tung Chung district councillor and care team to offer support to people affected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One Tung Chung resident surnamed Cheung was heading to the market to buy water. He said he had to rush back home to take a shower before the suspension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The water suspension is annoying. I will go to bed earlier. I need to work tomorrow. I have asked my younger sister to boil some water so we have water to drink," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hospital Authority has said the operation of North Lantau Hospital in Tung Chung will not be affected.

   Russia's Diana Shnaider won her fourth WTA title of a breakout season on Sunday as she blew away Katie Boulter in straight sets at the Hong Kong Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top seed dismantled Britain's second-seeded Boulter 6-1, 6-2 in a one-sided final at Victoria Park lasting 71 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 20-year-old Shnaider, who is ranked 14th in the world, added the Hong Kong crown to titles in Budapest, Bad Homburg in Germany and Hua Hin, Thailand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This year I did an amazing job," she said, admitting that she will have a target on her back from now on after such a successful 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next year everyone will be getting ready, knowing my game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added: "Even if there are a lot of losses, I'll be as positive as possible, just keep building my game, my mentality, my physical strength.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are a lot of things I can improve and achieve to be, say, a top-10 player. It's not a rush, I'll have to be patient."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two people on Sunday were hospitalised, and nine others were injured following accidents at the Sha Tin Cycling Festival, with riders reporting that the path was uneven.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 700 people took part in the inaugural event with 11 races held along the Shing Mun River.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The accidents took place in the youth and elite group competitions, involving nine male and two female riders. Most suffered minor injuries, while two needed hospital treatment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In one of the accidents, a cyclist lost control and crashed into a first aid station, causing other bikers to fall as well, while video footage showed a cyclist in a neck brace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   KT Ng from race organisers Hong Kong Flash Exchange Association said there was not enough time to tidy up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are cars that usually drive on this path on a daily basis. I could see some uneven areas on the road before the race. I contacted the Highways Department during the week to pave the road," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The road was closed at four in the morning and races started at 6.30am. There wasn't enough time, so some things might have been overlooked during the clean-up."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Retired cyclist and event ambassador, Wong Kam-po, said the roads met specifications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will be better with more experience, because most of the accidents were caused by collisions. Some cyclists might not have good control when it comes to maintaining their position," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They also might not have sufficient experience or it could be nerves."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong added that he hopes to see more competitions take place in Hong Kong.

    Labour chief: top talent scheme vital for HK

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Welfare and Labour Chris Sun on Sunday said it is vital for Hong Kong to attract well-qualified talents from outside its borders, in view of a shortage of local graduates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK programme, the minister noted there are currently about 50,000 local graduates each year, much lower than when he graduated decades ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said that the combination of lower graduate numbers and there being many more career paths than before has left Hong Kong short on talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted that the Top Talent Pass Scheme – where applicants are not required to have a job offer before applying for a visa – shows that the government is being more flexible in importing skilled workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Over the years, Hong Kong has been attractive to talent, but the actual number of people coming here is quite low because our vetting process has been pretty strict. However, as the economy tries to return to normal after the pandemic and with fewer young people around, we really need more highly qualified talent. So, what can we do? That’s when I thought of asking for specific qualification requirements, leading to the Top Talent Pass Scheme,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, there’s no annual quota, with tens of thousands of people arriving in the city through the scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister added he is not concerned that bringing in too many people might potentially harm the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe Hong Kong is an expensive place to live, and it’s tough to make a living. If someone can thrive here, they’re definitely talented. If they can’t make it, they’ll simply leave. It’s a natural process of elimination. While talent chooses Hong Kong, we also choose them,” Sun said.

   The health chief Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said the government is working on its review of the SAR's healthcare system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo's comments came after the Chief Executive said the government will reform the functions and divisions of work at the Hospital Authority, Department of Health and the newly-established Primary Healthcare Commission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lo explained how the healthcare system could be rearranged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, chest and dermatological services have been provided by the Department of Health. But we would like to redistribute these services to either the Hospital Authority or the Primary Healthcare Commission," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Department of Health, meanwhile, will focus on disease prevention and control, health promotion and take on a monitoring role."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief also urged those with chronic or episodic illnesses, such as the flu, not to immediately seek help from the Hospital Authority.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo said they should first consult their family doctor, and offered assurances that the government would still take care of the underprivileged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For those who cannot afford this, such as people on low incomes and who are receiving the comprehensive social security assistance, the government will be responsible for them. We will take care of them at the general out-patient clinics."

   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said that Hong Kong's deepening cooperation with the Middle East can go beyond finance, innovation and technology, and investment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing in his blog, Chan said the SAR can also promote more people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning between China and the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During meetings and exchanges, many Middle Eastern investment institutions said that Hong Kong is international, diverse, and can respect different cultural values, allowing both parties to deepen cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit," he wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To them, Hong Kong's role as a 'super connector' not only connects the mainland with European, American and Middle Eastern markets, but can also be extended to connecting emerging markets with different backgrounds and cultures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also said his visit to Riyadh the past week was fruitful and that a series of projects were being facilitated as a result, proving that “Brand Hong Kong” not only has unique value, but also great development potential.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also said he is in talks with the Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative to host its second summit in the SAR next year.

   Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she hopes to promote the SAR as a talent hub at the upcoming National People’s Congress Standing Committee meeting in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said the top legislative body will at the meeting review several bills and reports, including on developing world-class universities on the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She expressed the hope that these institutions will boost cooperation with universities in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I want to hear about what policies there will be in terms of the cooperation between the mainland’s ‘double first-class universities’ and Hong Kong’s universities. These are important for building Hong Kong into an international hub for top talents,” Lee told reporters at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day NPC session will be held from Monday to Friday.
