<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City collapsed to their fifth straight defeat on Saturday, hammered 4-0 by Tottenham in another huge blow to their Premier League title hopes as Arsenal got their challenge back on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rout at the Etihad ends City's 52-game unbeaten home run and leaves manager Pep Guardiola scrambling for answers just two days after he signed a contract extension with the club he has guided to four consecutive league titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the start of the match, City staged a spectacular tribute to the injured Rodri, who showcased the Ballon d'Or trophy he won last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the feel-good spirit did not last long as Spurs showed the home team how much they are missing the Spain midfielder, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored twice in the opening 20 minutes and Pedro Porro extended Tottenham's lead early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs completed their crushing win in stoppage time when Timo Werner raced down the left, squaring for Brennan Johnson to slide home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we have to live it and break it winning the next games, especially the next one. Now we see things in one way, maybe in a few weeks we see it differently."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added: "The fire is when you win a lot of games, which is better than when you are losing, but we accept this. We have to move forward and break it and try."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who have lost their past three Premier League matches and their last five in all competitions, remain five points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand against Southampton on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time defending Premier League champions travel to Anfield next weekend, where defeat would leave their title hopes in tatters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are now in sixth spot, said he was proud of his side, admitting said it was possible to become "spooked" against City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They test you in every way - mentally, physically, tactically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal earlier crushed Nottingham Forest 3-0 to pull level on 22 points with third-placed Chelsea, who saw off Leicester in the early kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's Gunners were expected to be contenders for City's crown after finishing second in each of the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they had failed to win in their previous four league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard's return from a long injury lay-off is a major boost for Arsenal and he teed up Bukayo Saka to blast home the opener on 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka turned provider for another special strike, this time by Thomas Partey early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenager Ethan Nwaneri then came off the bench to score his first Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking about Odegaard, who returned to action at Inter Milan earlier this month, Arteta said: "It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea remain ahead of Arsenal on goals scored after a 2-1 win on manager Enzo Maresca's return to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson scored the opener but Chelsea struggled to make their dominance count until Enzo Fernandez headed home, before a late consolation goal from the penalty spot for Jordan Ayew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa are now winless in six games in all competition and had to twice come from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's incredible start under 31-year-old boss Fabian Hurzeler continued with a 2-1 win at Bournemouth to climb to fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are out of the bottom three thanks to a stunning 4-1 win at Fulham, with Matheus Cunha scoring twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton failed to take advantage of an early red card for Brentford's Christian Norgaard in a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.

    Springboks crush hapless Wales 54-12

<img alt="South Africa's Aphelele Fassi crashes over for the Springboks' fifth try against Wales. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780579_1_20241124073302.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 World champions South Africa hammered Wales 45-12 in Cardiff on Saturday to condemn Warren Gatland's team to a 12th consecutive Test defeat and a winless calendar year for the first time since 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Springboks were dominant throughout at the Principality Stadium, scoring seven tries to two in a relentless display that matched attacking accuracy with defensive brutality and set-piece mastery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result meant the Boks, who wrapped up the Rugby Championship title this year, finish their season with 11 victories from 13 Tests, having used a whopping 52 players and scoring 57 tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first two games we weren't happy, there was so much we could have done better," Springbok captain Siya Kolisi told TNT Sports of opening November victories over Scotland and England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Results are important but it's how you do things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the first time South Africa have won all their matches on their November tour since 2013 and means they will see in 2025 as World Rugby's number one ranked country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boks' sole losses were one-point defeats by Argentina and Ireland, a record of which Gatland and his backroom staff could only dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales' last victory came over pool opponents Georgia in October 2023 at the Rugby World Cup, with Gatland having to blood a raft of inexperienced players after a host of seniors hung up their boots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-match entertainment included choirs singing "Yma O Hyd", the Dafydd Iwan folk song that has become the go-to song for Welsh football's "Red Wall" support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, it translates into English as "Still Here", albeit in reference to Wales and the Welsh language and not Gatland per se.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Welsh Rugby Union has its AGM on Sunday where discussions are expected on the New Zealander's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You don't make a decision straight after a game," said Gatland. "Let's just see what happens over the next few days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales captain Dewi Lake told TNT Sports his side had showed "a lot of heart and character".
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are double world champions, that's not for no reason," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to keep the faith, the second we lose our faith in ourselves then it's pointless us stepping on the field, we can definitely see a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scene was set within the opening eight frantic minutes in the Welsh capital as the visiting lock pair of Franco Mostert and Eben Etzebeth each crossed for a try after deft attacking lead-up play by Kurt-Lee Arendse on both occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kolisi was held up over the line by James Botham, but the Boks fired back to the Welsh line and Arendse got his just rewards for his strong start, stepping inside Blair Murray's attempted tackle with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Hendrikse converted two of the three tries to make it 19-0 after the opening quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray did well to hold up Aphelele Fassi over the line and Kolisi had a try disallowed, but the toll on Wales was beginning to show.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long could their defence hold out? Not long as the Boks promptly pushed Wales off their own ball at scrum time and flanker Elrigh Louw barged over for the visitors' fourth five-pointer after a quick tap penalty by Jasper Wiese.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rare Welsh incursion into the opposition half saw the home side, wearing white to avoid a colour-blindness clash with the green of South Africa, go for an attacking line-out, but the Boks repelled two 12-man mauls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was eventually moved wide and Welsh winger Rio Dyer showed a brilliant flash of raw pace to scorch the defence for a fine individual try. Sam Costelow missed the conversion to leave the score 26-5 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fassi crossed for South Africa's fifth try after the outstanding Arendse split the Welsh line early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A raft of replacements for both sides gave Wales a degree of respite, but it was not long before Gerhard Steenkamp was driven over from short range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things turned scrappy and the 67,236-strong crowd turned attention away from the action and Welsh hymns to foot-stomping Mexican waves, always a sure sign the game was well and over as a contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrikse crossed for the Boks' seventh try and converted for a personal game tally of 15 points before a Botham consolation try converted by Ben Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other Test action, New Zealand saw off Italy 29-11 in their final match of the year as Sam Cane was given a winning farewell to international rugby in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Roigard, Will Jordan, Mark Tele'a and Beauden Barrett scored the tries as the All Blacks beat Italy for the 18th consecutive time, with fly-half Barrett kicking the rest visitors' points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cane closed out his Test career with 104 caps, and T-J Perenara also played his final All Blacks match as a second half substitute. (AFP)

    Sudan army says recaptures key state capital

<img alt="Since April 2023, the war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780565_1_20241123223549.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sudanese army said on Saturday it had retaken a key state capital south of Khartoum from rival paramilitaries who had held it for the past five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sennar state capital of Sinja is a strategic prize in the 19-month-old war between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said that Sinja had been "liberated... from the terrorist militia."
  <br>
  <br>
  It posted footage on social media that it said had been filmed inside the main base in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sinja has returned to the embrace of the nation," the information minister of the army-backed government, Khaled al-Aiser, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiser's office said armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had travelled to the city of Sennar, 60 kilometres to the north, on Saturday to "inspect the operation and celebrate the liberation of Sinja."
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF had taken the two cities in a lightning offensive in June that saw nearly 726,000 civilians flee, according to UN figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights groups have said that those who were unwilling or unable to leave have faced months of arbitrary violence by RSF fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinja teacher Abdullah al-Hassan spoke of his "indescribable joy" at seeing the army enter the city after "months of terror."
  <br>
  <br>
  "At any moment, you were waiting for militia fighters to barge in and beat you or loot you," the 53-year-old said by telephone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides in the Sudanese conflict have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminately shelling homes, markets and hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF has also been accused of summary executions, systematic sexual violence and rampant looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The paramilitaries control nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur as well as large swathes of Kordofan in the south. They also hold much of the capital Khartoum and the key farming state of Al-Jazira to its south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million – creating what the UN says is the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the eastern state of Gedaref – where more than 1.1 million displaced people have sought refuge – Asia Khedr, 46, said she hoped her family's ordeal might soon be at an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll finally go home and say goodbye to this life of displacement and suffering," she said. (AFP)

<img alt="People running errands in Edinburgh before the heavy snow arrives. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780562_1_20241123214307.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and Ireland faced travel chaos on Saturday as a winter storm battered northwest Europe with strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties in Ireland without power and closed roads and some ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between England and Scotland, advised customers not to attempt travel beyond the northern English city of Preston, as it cancelled numerous trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Highways also issued a "severe weather alert," warning of "blizzard conditions" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England, with a number of road closures announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday -- the majority in southwest England – with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."
  <br>

    Lebanon says 11 killed in Israeli strike on Beirut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut, while Hezbollah has yet to mention it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building, and a fire truck and civil defence rescuers stationed nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 11 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said, adding it had also left behind "a large amount of body parts that are being identified."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state-run National News Agency said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lebanese security source said on condition of anonymity that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure," though it was unclear if they were killed. The official did not name the figure. (AFP)

 South Korea has decided not to attend a memorial ceremony set to take place in Japan to honour wartime forced labour victims, including many Koreans, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Asian neighbours have long been at odds over historical issues linked to Japan's brutal colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including sexual slavery and forced labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register, after South Korea voiced objections to its listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul had dropped its initial objections "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo had agreed to host a memorial event every year – its first edition set to be held on Sado Island on Sunday – to honour the forced labour victims, as a condition for South Korea's consent to the Unesco listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday, Seoul said the country would "not attend the Sado mine memorial ceremony, scheduled for November 24, taking into account various circumstances surrounding the event."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was insufficient time to reconcile differing positions between the diplomatic authorities of both countries, making it unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the ceremony," it added, without elaborating further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo said earlier this week that Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister at Japan's foreign ministry, will attend the ceremony as the government's representative, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was met with criticism from some local media outlets in Seoul, as she has visited the Yasukuni Shrine – a site considered highly sensitive in South Korea due to the enshrinement of some of Japan's war criminals there. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was an historic day for American Patrick Reed at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling on Saturday, as he shot a rare round of 59 to catapult himself into a three-stroke lead at the end of day three.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 2018 winner at Augusta carded 11 birdies in his sizzling 11-under-par third round to go 18-under overall on the prestigious Asian Tour event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old's milestone is the lowest score ever in the tournament and overtakes a 60 scored by Britain's Ian Poulter in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had probably one of my worst warm-ups ever," Reed, 34, who is among a number of big-name players to have jumped ship to the Saudi-backed Liv Golf circuit, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked at my caddie and he said, 'Hey, a warm-up's a warm-up. Let's go out and just play golf. Some of your best rounds have come from a poor warm-up.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  The American started with a blistering five birdies in a row and rattled off four more on the trot to finish with a flurry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I honestly felt it could have been lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going into the final round in Fanling, Reed holds a three-shot lead over India's Rashid Khan and Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand as he chases a first win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand is a further shot back at 14-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong golfing sensation Taichi Kho shot a four-under-par 66 for round three to go 12-under overall, as the tournament gears up for its final round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho, along with six other players, ended the afternoon strong to hold on to a tie for sixth place – after a dominant display that saw him grouped with Japan's Kazuki Higa and Kevin Yuan of Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting off with a birdie was great," Kho told reporters. "I capitalised on a good second shot on the sixth [hole], and got away with a good break on thirteenth being behind a tree – but I had a big gap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So being able to hit it on and two from there, and two putting from birdie, definitely helped boost my round quite a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the 24-year-old bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open crown, he also noted the challenges he overcame throughout the afternoon under rainier conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A bit of fortune there," Kho said. "There were times where I found myself in the trees, but I managed to find an opening without much concern, which gave me the focus I needed to hit a good shot."
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the 63rd edition of the Hong Kong Open. (AFP/RTHK)

    Mixed reactions to third stress test in Kai Tak

<img alt="The third stress test involving 5,000 people at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground was held on Saturday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780542_1_20241123180323.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Saturday evening said a test event at Kai Tak had gone smoothly, and the results were satisfactory. They added that they think the venue they used is ready to host more events.
 <br>
  <br>
  But there were mixed responses to the third stress test at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground, which was aiming to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test involved 4,500 civil servants and 500 members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike previous trials, designated seating was adopted this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test kicked off at 3.30 pm and was expected to run until 8:45 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong attending the event, said the trial would finish too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They said it will end at around 8:45 pm, but restaurants will already be closing by then. Many places will have called last orders already, so you can't really go out and enjoy dinner. You can only head home directly after the test," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong revealed that he was only told on Monday that he had to attend the event, and he had to reschedule his birthday celebration for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another participant surnamed Cheung headed to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there are some canopies along the way, but said that it would be better if there were more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also told RTHK that he appreciated the signage from the MTR station to the venue, adding that the walk took less than 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of signs and staff. Everything is very clear. We definitely didn't take an unnecessarily long route."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a man surnamed Au said his journey from the Sung Wong Toi area had many zig zag routes, which may take time for the public to familiarise with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police chief Raymond Siu revealed that officers from the tactical unit were deployed to the stress test.

 At least 32 people were killed and 47 wounded in sectarian clashes in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Saturday, two days after attacks on Shi'ite passenger convoys killed 43.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporadic fighting between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has killed around 150 over the past months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni communities continues at multiple locations. According to the latest reports, 32 people have been killed which include 14 Sunnis and 18 Shi'ites," a senior administrative official said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling with a police escort in Kurram, killing 43 while 11 wounded are still in "critical condition", officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, Shi'ite Muslims on Friday evening attacked several Sunni locations in the Kurram district, once a semi-autonomous region, where sectarian violence has resulted in the deaths of hundreds over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around 7 pm (1400 GMT), a group of enraged Shi'ite individuals attacked the Sunni-dominated Bagan Bazaar," said a senior police officer stationed in Kurram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After firing, they set the entire market ablaze and entered nearby homes, pouring petrol and setting them on fire. Initial reports suggest over 300 shops and more than 100 houses have been burned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local Sunnis "also fired back at the attackers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Javedullah Mehsud, a senior official in Kurram said there were "efforts to restore peace ... (through) the deployment of security forces" and with the help of "local elders." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers can start moving into new offices on Saturday, with the renovation works for the first phase of the expansion project at the Legislative Council Complex completed ahead of schedule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his social media, the council's president, Andrew Leung, said that the early move is a testament to the unity and cooperation of all members and staff involved in the project, adding that lawmakers can finally "get to the next level under one roof".
  <br>
  <br>
  The renovation included the addition of four storeys to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said that the relocation will allow all members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as a temporary office to return to the complex, while also moving members already in the building to higher levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that some finishing touches are still needed, such as waterproofing the exterior walls, clean up, and interior design, adding that the Secretariat, together with the Architectural Services Department and contractor, would follow up with the matter. He encouraged lawmakers to share their suggestions for improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Leung said that the second phase of the expansion project would start as soon as possible, including the construction of a new conference room and public education facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes that all expansion projects will be completed before October of next year.

    Rich nations raise climate pledge offer to US$300bn

<img alt="The previous offer of US$250bn a year had been panned by developing countries as insultingly low. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780526_1_20241123153155.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to US$300 billion per year by 2035, sources said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The summit had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries – who must adopt the deal by consensus – tried to reach agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shift in position came after a US$250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. (Reuters)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown drains a three-pointer on his way to top-scoring for the Boston Celtics. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780523_1_20241123151736.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown top-scored with 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics struggled to a 108-96 win at Washington in the NBA Cup on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics moved to 13-8 on the season but still have some work to do in the NBA Cup, where they are in second place at 2-1 in Eastern Conference Group C behind the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their celebratory trip to the White House on Thursday, the Celtics trailed by two at half-time, having been 11 points behind at one stage, and it wasn't until late in the fourth quarter that they were able to pull away from the Wizards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown delivered down the stretch, his superb turnaround jumper giving Boston a 99-92 lead and ending Washington's resistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a vintage Celtics performance though.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum, who scored 16 points, was 0-for-10 from three-point range and Boston shot 42.4 percent from the floor and 23.9 percent from three-point range, equalling their lowest scoring output of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla picked up a technical foul in the second half for remonstrating with the referee but said his emotions had an impact on the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It changed the energy in the arena. Did you feel that? It wasn't really about energising the guys, it was more about manipulating the environment. It was just what the environment needed at the time," said Mazzulla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, without the injured Luka Doncic, survived a strong comeback from the Denver Nuggets to emerge with a 123-120 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naji Marshall top-scored for the Mavs, off the bench, with 26 points, while PJ Washington put up 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic had a triple-double, top-scoring for Denver with 33 points along with 17 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas had a 24-point lead early in the third but Denver battled back and DeAndre Jordan's alley oop dunk shot made it a two-point game with 8:47 left in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Gafford's two-point shot levelled the game 108-108 with 5:13 remaining and it was nip and tuck all the way down the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Denver down a point and just four seconds left on the clock, Jamal Murray tried to hit the rim with his second free throw but inadvertently found the basket and two free throws from Washington sealed the win for Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all stepped up at the right time and we gutted out this win," said Mavs point guard Kyrie Irving, who said the team had shown the right attitude without Doncic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is next-man-up mentality and we've got to do our best to find that rhythm. Consistently feed each other that confidence, especially in tough environments like this. We had to will ourselves to this win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philadelphia 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 113-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared McCain scored 30 points and Tyrese Maxey 26 as the 76ers coped without the injured Joel Embiid and Paul George.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Johnson top-scored for the Nets with 37 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 30 points for the Golden State Warriors as they won 112-108 at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of free throws from Draymond Green saw the Warriors over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State's win moves them to 12-3 in the regular season and put them into the quarter-finals of the NBA Cup as they sit on a 3-0 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo produced his second triple-double in four games putting up 37 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Indiana Pacers 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard helped out with 24 points and 12 assists as the Bucks claimed their third straight win and went 2-0 in the NBA Cup.

  Gary Trent Jr, off the bench, added 18 points for Milwaukee with his 6-of-10 three-point shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's playing with confidence, walks with confidence, works hard," Antetokounmpo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are the shots he makes in practice and we knew that sooner or later he would make them in games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am happy for him and need him to keep playing with confidence." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers were out bright and early on Saturday to celebrate the twin panda cubs' 100 days at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many donned panda headbands and costumes, while others carried panda toys as they waited to glimpse a broadcast of the cubs on giant LED screens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The older club, weighing 5.3 kilogrammes, was seen lying peacefully in bed, while her little brother, weighing 5.5 kilogrammes, was more lively, patting his sister from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy because Ying Ying and Le Le have been in Hong Kong for a while now and they finally have children, so its a joyous occasion," said a woman surnamed Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Law, who carried a large stuffed panda, said she's been looking forward to today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughters and I love pandas because they're so pure and well-behaved. That's why I take this stuffed panda with me everywhere I go. I even bring it to dim sum. I love taking photos of pandas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People were also excited by the reopening of the Giant Panda Adventure facility after two months, which houses the cubs' father, Le Le.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said a lot of publicity has been done in the SAR to promote the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new pandas will be Hong Kong's new tourism ambassadors...in hopes that they will attract more tourists to come," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors also received red eggs and pork knuckle ginger stew with vinegar at the event - dishes served to celebrate the birth of a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park also said that people can look forward to meeting the two new giant pandas gifted by the Central Government next month.

    Police plan to use test strips to detect 'space oil'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force made over 90 arrests for offenses related to "space oil" in the first 10 months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Space oil is an emerging drug that is usually inhaled through vapes. It often contains etomidate - a part 1 poison that has to be prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters after a passing-out parade that the force is looking to use test strips for detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, when patrolling officers find someone who's suspicious, let's say the person is suspected of taking space oil, we could immediately use test strips to check. We hope that this could have a deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief pointed out that in an operation carried out in Kwai Tsing district related to space oil, all but four of the 17 arrestees were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the police will step up education by inviting people who used to take the drug, as well as medical workers, to share the hazards of space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is aiming to list space oil as a dangerous drug next year.

    'Two years suitable to comply with new standards'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780509_1_20241123114216.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok said that a two-year time frame is suitable for sports bodies to comply with new standards, adding that the National Sports Associations responded positively to the review report and governance code.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China had earlier reviewed the operations and governance of 77 member associations across six key areas - board governance, integrity management, selection of athletes, management of coaches and umpires, administration of membership, and general administration - totalling 243 governance items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, Fok, who is also vice-president of SF&OC, noted that nearly 60 percent of these items have been fully or partially implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that when it comes to selecting athletes, the criteria must be fair, just and open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think past performance or potential should account for the vast majority of the selection process for all athletes. The responsibility of the National Sports Associations is to write down clear requirements. For each competition, what goals do I hope to achieve and what athletes do I hope to select? Performance may account for 60 percent, and there may be other indicators that account for the rest of the percentage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important principle is that the athlete's performance cannot be buried and cannot be prevented by other factors or institutional factors from being able to perform to the best of their abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said that the code of governance recommends that sports bodies implement a maximum tenure and length of term of office an individual may serve on the Board of Directors, adding that the age should not exceed 70 or 75 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each sports association faces different situations. Their initial establishment or stage of development and the level of talent participation in their industry or sports field are different. If there's a hard-and-fast age set, it may not necessarily be the best for the development of the sport so it's important to leave room for flexibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC initiated a review of its governance and operations following a 2020 audit report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body had said that member associations failing to meet the new governance and operational standards in the two-year time frame may face penalties, including reductions in subsidies.

    'Senior staff held more accountable increases morale'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hospital Authority emphasised that its plan to hold senior staff more accountable when medical blunders occur will not demoralise workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The HA announced earlier that it will set up a high-level reform committee to review the responsibility of staff of all ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after a review committee, which was set up months ago after a series of incidents, found that the duties of staff are not clearly defined.
  <br>
  <br>
  HA chairman Henry Fan told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that he believes the move will not dispirit senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're trying to do is to actually build up a more proper governance system and management structure, which will in fact assist our colleagues in performing better for the well-being of our patients, which is what the HA is about. We want to provide the best service and have the confidence of the people of Hong Kong. So, I don't think it will be demoralising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we would do it properly in a sense that we will have consultation before we reach any decision. I think it will, in fact, increase morale."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reform, the HA officially plans to roll out a reward-and-penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan has more ideas that he believes could be beneficial, such as giving staff a warning letter for a minor medical blunder. If they are involved in two or more incidents, then they would not get a pay rise for a year - but he stressed that these are just his personal views and have not been discussed by the committee yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is one way to hold colleagues accountable. Because we cannot say any time you make a mistake, you're suspended. Nor can we say every time you make a mistake, you only get a letter or a warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan added that the HA is also considering setting up channels for staff to voice their opinions confidentially.

    Fears for Gaza hospitals as fuel and aid run low

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the United Nations warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warning came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza medics said an overnight Israeli raid on the cities of Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, told reporters all hospitals in the Palestinian territory "will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry".
  <br>
  <br>
  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of 80 patients, including 8 in the intensive care unit" at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of just two partly operating in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said, "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that for more than six weeks, Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has hit aid convoys. (AFP)

<img alt="France's Gabin Villiere scores a second try for the hosts at Stade de France. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780493_1_20241123073337.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France eased to a 37-23 victory over an ill-disciplined Argentina at a bitterly cold Paris in their final game of the November internationals on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus claimed four tries including a superb solo effort from in-form winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey, following on from victories over Japan and New Zealand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three from three during the series makes us happy, it was the objective," Bielle-Biarrey told TF1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan was a little warm-up, then against the All Blacks we fought until the end. We end with three wins and I feel we improved game on game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Pumas had two players shown yellow cards in the first half, captain Julian Montoya and Juan Martin Gonzalez, which led to the hosts leading 30-9 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't start the way we wanted, our discipline wasn't good," Montoya told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What made me proud was we went again until the 80th minute, there's things to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  France coach Fabien Galthie made four changes from last Saturday's nerve-wracking one-point win over New Zealand as Charles Ollivon came in for the dropped Gregory Alldritt at No 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina boss Felipe Contepomi switched his scrum-half giving Gonzalo Garcia a start instead of Gonzalo Bertranou after last Friday's loss to Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the All Blacks, Les Bleus lost prop Tevita Tatafu to an early injury and loose-head Jean-Baptiste Gros suffered a similar fate after four minutes on Friday with a leg problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gros's injury was caused by Montoya's dangerous clean at a ruck and the hooker was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie's side made the extra man count to open the scoring as Antoine Dupont fed lock Thibaud Flament to crash over from short range after a powerful rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Ramos slotted the easy conversion to make it 7-0 after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the half hour mark the hosts lead 13-9 as Ramos traded penalty goals with Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz.
  <br>
  <br>
  France stretched their advantage to 20-9 as winger Gabin Villiere dived over following some dominant forward carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos added the conversion to overtake Dimitri Yachvili in third place on France's scoring charts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things worsened for Contepomi's outfit as they conceded a penalty try with four minutes of the first half to play and had a second player sent to the bin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flanker Gonzalez was shown a yellow card for palming a loose ball into touch after Dupont and Ramos showed their class with delicate chip kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France went into the break 30-9 ahead as Ramos slotted his third penalty of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the interval Galthie brought 20-year-old back-rower Marko Gazzotti on for his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flanker's main intervention was to scramble onto a loose ball three metres from his own line before Les Bleus cleared with Argentina working their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 24 minutes to play they were rewarded as prop Thomas Gallo benefitted from a rolling maul and Albornoz brought the score to 30-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas' comeback hopes were shortlived as Bielle-Biarrey scored his fourth try in three games, showing lightning speed to gather his own grubber kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos converted to make it 37-16 leaving the south Americans, fourth at last year's World Cup, with a mountain to climb in the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deficit was cut once again as Perpignan hooker Ignacio Ruiz, one of 10 French-based players in Argentina's matchday squad, barrelled over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz took the score to 37-23 with his two-pointer with nine minutes to play but it wasn't enough to claim a first win over France in Paris since 2014. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week on a positive note, continuing earlier gains on optimism about the Trump Administration. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780490_1_20241123065830.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to a fresh record on Friday, extending a post-election US equity rally while the euro retreated against the US dollar following weak eurozone data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blue-chip index piled on one percent to end the day at 44,296.51, narrowly overtaking a record set earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose one percent to close at 44,296.51, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,969.34 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to 19,003.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major American indices have been at or near record territory since the US election, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump's programme of tax cuts and regulatory scale-back would more than offset the impact of expected tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trading most of this week has been influenced by the growth agenda," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have been cheered this week by a broadening of the rally beyond the tech names that dominated earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar also continued to strengthen, reflecting less certainty about additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the US currency's status as a haven asset amid escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro was also battered by a closely watched survey showing contractions in November business activity in the eurozone.

  The HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) published by S&P Global dropped to 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October, the most marked rate of contraction in 10 months. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things could hardly have turned out much worse," said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone's manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the euro fell both Paris and Frankfurt stocks managed to recover their losses and advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone data has increased the chance of more rate cuts from the ECB next year," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as well a cut of 50 basis points next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have been jolted into recalibrating interest rate expectations on the back of this bleak economic news," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  London managed to gain 1.4 percent despite data showing that retail sales figures for October undershot forecasts, as the pound fell against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin set a new record high above US$99,500 on Friday, before easing slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leading digital currency is expected to push through US$100,000 as investors grow increasingly hopeful that Trump will pass measures to deregulate the crypto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared more than 40 percent since the Republican's election victory this month and has more than doubled since the turn of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent surge has also been "driven by news that Trump could set up an official crypto department that would sit in the heart of US government," said XTB's Brooks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Armed robbers snatched jewels worth millions from a work by famed Parisian goldsmith Joseph Chaumet and classed a national treasure in a brazen heist at a French museum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron Museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a three-metre work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as "Via Vitae", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros (US$7.3 million), mayor Nesme said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage", mayor Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been "traumatised" by the violent intrusion, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad daylight robbery saw thieves break into a display case with axes and baseball bats in full view of visitors and staff at the Cognacq-Jay museum. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Holding senior managers at public hospitals accountable for blunders means they have the responsibility to try to prevent them from happening, medical sector lawmaker David Lam said on Friday, after the Hospital Authority vowed to improve its governance and accountability.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review committee put forward more than 30 recommendations to the Hospital Authority, including enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as defining the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, a member of the review committee, said strengthening accountability at a higher level meant it won't just be frontline staff taking the blame whenever a medical incident happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That puts a responsibility on the senior management that they have to maintain a low complication rate or a low incident rate in their department. And a way to do so is to make sure the staff are adequately trained and adequately staffed," Lam told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker added it's important to build up a "good portal of communication" among all levels of hospital staff, with the review noting junior employees not always willing to speak up even when they spotted problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The senior staff should start the ball rolling, and encourage the frontline staff or the junior staff to talk to them whenever necessary," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men died in separate industrial accidents in Central and Tung Chung on Friday, sparking fresh calls to protect workers' safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, an 18-year-old apprentice fell into an escalator shaft during repairs at the Euro Trade Centre on Des Voeux Road Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued by firefighters and rushed to Ruttonjee Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fatal work accident occurred at a public housing construction site in Tung Chung, where a 57-year-old painter was believed to be trapped on a spider lift platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead at North Lantau Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it's investigating both tragedies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A workers' rights representative said the occurrence of more industrial accidents serves as a warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said both government and industry need to do more to prevent future incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are heartbroken to hear that workers have passed away. It has only been a little over a week since three workers died from work accidents in five days. This is a huge wake-up call," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People from the industry and government departments need to help think of ways to solve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it is an equipment problem, please improve it immediately. If it involves insufficient training, please strengthen mandatory training as soon as possible."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have approved HK$33.5 billion in funding to help with the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) offsetting mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mechanism will be scrapped from May 1 next year, and a 25-year subsidy scheme will provide for employers as they adapt to the policy change by sharing the costs associated with severance and long service payments during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers endorsed the funding request at a Legco Finance Committee meeting on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the government plans to engage a processing agent to assist in the implementation of the subsidy scheme, by facilitating, vetting and approving applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Bill Tang, for his part, said he's concerned that some people may not understand the arrangements well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be some cases in future because we know that maybe some employers or even some employees do not understand the arrangement of the cancelling offsetting mechanism... We can foresee some disputes between employees and employers, so the FTU is very concerned about it," Tang said.

    Vegas disaster for Verstappen as team bring wrong wing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen's hopes of clinching a fourth consecutive drivers' world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend took a dent on Friday when Red Bull revealed they had brought the wrong rear wing.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Auto Motor und Sport, the team's senior advisor Helmut Marko said Red Bull were losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight, the Las Vegas Boulevard leading to Caesars Palace, after a packing blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have another rear wing, a smaller rear wing, as we see on our competitors," said Marko. "It would be more helpful, for sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it was too late for the team to arrange for a more appropriate trimmed rear wing to be flown out to Las Vegas before the race on Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen leads McLaren's Lando Norris by 62 points with three races remaining and simply needs to finish ahead of him in Las Vegas to become the sixth man to win four world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, however, struggled in second practice on Thursday night, finishing 17th in slippery conditions on the cold, dry and dusty circuit around the streets of 'Sin City' where the three-time champion won last year's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen tried to make light of the team's error, in packing the wrong rear wing, and blamed his struggle on the slippery conditions and difficulty with tyre temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The issue for us is definitely tyre-related as we have no grip and it feels like driving on ice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We struggled to make the tyres work, especially over one lap and we were quite far off with the pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team-mate Sergio Perez was 19th in the session topped by Mercedes' seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of Norris of McLaren, who said on Wednesday it is "probably too late" to stop Verstappen from taking the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were flashes of speed," said Marko. "We just have to get consistency into it. On the single lap we can improve but on the long run, the tyre wear is a problem at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that conditions may change in favour of Red Bull before the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow is a different day," he said. "You see it a lot of times. People will be fastest on Friday, or Thursday, but it doesn't mean that they are fast in the race. We will, for sure, make a reasonable step." (AFP)

    COP29 draft proposes rich nations pay US$250bn a year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)

 New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell on Friday shot a five-under 65 to surge to the top of the leaderboard at the Hong Kong Open, putting the defending champion one shot ahead of Thailand's Nitithorn Thippong as the competition entered the halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a dominant display for Campbell, 33, who took advantage of his familiarity with the course in Fanling to outperform his group comprising South Korean phenom Tom Kim and American Peter Uihlein under sunny and bright conditions, a far-cry from Thursday's wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell had a two-day total of 12-under 128, overtaking opening round leader Nitithorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – Australian Kevin Yuan, Kazuki Higa of Japan and Yongjun Bae of South Korea, who had the day's best score of 62 – were tied for third at 9-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho moved up the leaderboard in his bid to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China star had another solid outing with a round of five-under 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho and four others were tied for sixth at eight under at the end of round two, four shots behind Campbell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim and Uihlein, meanwhile, were among those missing the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today gave me a lot of confidence and proved what I was doing was working," Campbell told reporters after his strong performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think being out on LIV as a reserve this year really helped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being around some of the best players in the world, seeing what they do, allowed me to back up the things I've learned from the team around me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell also spoke about what it meant to be competing in the SAR again, as he looks to defend his title and add a second Asian Tour title to his resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've found a swing that my body seems to like a lot more," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning here last year was massive. It's always nice to come back to a golf course you really like and feel comfortable on, so it's definitely great to be back here again."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's hospital bosses have vowed to clarify the responsibility of staff of all ranks and strengthen accountability of senior management when it comes to medical incidents, after a review committee found the roles of workers are not clearly established.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instructed by the administration following a string of medial blunders, the Hospital Authority (HA) set up a review committee a few months ago to look into the operations and management of public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among 31 recommendations put forward to the authority, the review committee suggested public hospitals enhance top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as define the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it would look into introducing a reward-and-penalty system when assessing staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important to more clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each of the staff at different levels," said HA chief executive Tony Ko on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee also recommend that in terms of the performance assessment of individual staff, we have to put into elements of quality and safety. So we'll be more explicit in terms of the performance assessment of the individual staff to see how they can reflect in part of the performance and obviously subsequently will be related to the accountability issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  The review committee noted that junior hospital staff often have a strong sense of hierarchy, stopping them from speaking up even when they spotted problems before incidents eventually happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Younger and less experienced staff members lacked enough training and were not too familiar with safety culture, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A high-level reform committee, to be led by HA chairman Henry Fan, will be formed. The permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the group will focus solely on improving governance and accountability, while other issues would be worked on as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, having said that, there are some issues, for example the recommendation that we should change the culture of HA, which would probably take some time," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Culture, by definition, is deep-rooted, and we can't expect to change that overnight. So we will do our best. But what we want is to try to make changes as quickly as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include strengthening clinical mentorship and supervision, and encouraging staff to report incidents.

    Bus fare increase requests opposed by lawmakers

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780399_1_20241122154054.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some lawmakers attending a Legco transport panel meeting on Friday voiced their opposition to fare increase applications made by franchised bus operators.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New Lantao Bus want to put fares up by 6.5 percent, while Citybus is seeking 9.5 percent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB told lawmakers it needs to charge more because the expansion of the MTR network is having an "irreversible" impact on its finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's finance director, Joseph Leung, said average daily passenger numbers are down nine percent compared to 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is due to changes in economic cycle, ageing population, as well as a change in people's commuting patterns, and people are going out less during weekends and at night," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing an expansion of the railway system, including the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line. We see a loss of 130,000 passengers every day. The further expansion of the railway system will hit the bus operators and these conditions are irreversible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang was among those criticising the fare increase applications. But he backed a Citybus plan to roll out a loyalty programme for customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes it will cover journeys between Tin Shui Wai and Hong Kong Island as bus fares are more expensive than the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for journeys from Tin Shui Wai North to Hong Kong Island, actually Citybus has the advantage. Because compared to the railway, Citybus routes are faster and more convenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the problem is that these routes are too expensive even when passengers interchange to trains. Therefore, if there are such loyalty programmes, I believe it will encourage commuters to choose to take buses."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said China is ready to engage in dialogue and manage differences with the United States to promote steady and sustained development of bilateral economic ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's also the China International Trade Representative, told a press conference on Friday that the world's two-largest economies are highly complementary as he emphasised the importance of their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to a reporter's question about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose 60 percent tariffs on imports from China, he said that would "not solve the country’s own trade deficit problem”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it leads to higher prices for imported products and inflation, with the burden ultimately falling on consumers," Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that China's total foreign trade including imports and exports reached 36 trillion yuan in January-October, up about 5 percent from the same period of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Friday's press conference, Wang and other officials outlined ways that China is promoting expanding trade and support for coping with climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such measures include streamlining customs and visa requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  China allows visa-free travel for citizens of 29 countries, including France and Germany, and the number of foreign visitors, which plunged during the pandemic, has jumped this year. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country's biggest internet forum concluded its four-day session in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Friday, with more than 1,800 guests from over 130 countries taking part.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech representatives and government ministers meet annually in the town for the World Internet Conference, which focused this year on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the conference, the World Internet Development report 2024 was issued, reviewing China’s internet development over the past three decades and projecting future directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the evolution of global cyberspace governance and stressed the need for international consensus on AI and data issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some attendees about what they hoped the summit will achieve.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the participants, City University’s deputy president Ray Cheung, said he wants more teaching collaboration within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “City University already established our Dongguan campus and 80 percent of the faculty that are teaching courses in Dongguan is actually coming from Hong Kong. So what we are seeing is a lot of synergies actually developing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we see Hong Kong as the global international education hub is taking a very important role for the GBA as well as the global education development.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Stanford neuroscientist and researcher Walter Greenleaf, said he hope to see some agreements to address looming healthcare crises after the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned from the pandemic that what happens in one spot can impact another spot. So I think as healthcare providers, as developers of healthcare technology, we need to transcend borders and just make sure that we realise that as people, as part of the world, we are in a great position to help each other."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said global investors have confidence in Hong Kong, dismissing reports of capital moving out of the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum on wealth management, Chan highlighted Hong Kong's status as a well-established international financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fundamentals as an international financial centre have remained as strong as ever. Recently, Hong Kong returned to the top three global financial centres, along with New York and London," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet from time to time, we come across reports about Hong Kong, such as those on the outflow of funds. A few important facts will illustrate that international investors remain highly confident in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said Hong Kong's stock market has continued to grow, raising about HK$70 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that asset and wealth management companies have been expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, increasing office space rentals and relocating senior executives to the city.

 The Hospital Authority (HA) is to set up a committee to reform its governance and structure after the government ordered a review of its management following a spate of medical blunders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said on Friday that the committee, to be formed under the HA's board, will be chaired by the authority's chairman, Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had been vetting a review report submitted over "systemic management issues" at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health chief Lo Chung-mau said his bureau agreed with the directions set out in 31 recommendations for enhancing the HA's governance and structure to provide better and safer healthcare services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Henry Fan, being the reform committee chairman, is to steer the implementation of recommendations made in the review report regarding governance, accountability and distribution of responsibilities, and relevant reform work," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that the HA will have to submit regular progress reports to the government to ensure that enhancement measures are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

 Residents and tourists gathered at China Merchant Wharf  in Western on Friday to get a view of the People's Liberation Army Navy's assault ship the Hainan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vessel, along with the Changsha destroyer which was docked at Stonecutters Island, arrived in the city on Thursday morning for a five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the spectators told RTHK he was stunned by the Hainan's size.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve got time, and the ships are here, so I just came to see the country’s strengths. I think the country being strong can help balance the world,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangdong said she decided to visit the city after hearing news about the two vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These ships are great. They don’t come here often, and this time it is staying for five days, so I came to Hong Kong just to see the ship. Just looking at the ship is enough,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of activities will be held during the ships’ stay, including tours, cultural exchanges and talks on national defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier that people will be able to understand the nation’s achievements in defence and military modernisation if they join the activities.

    Cyberport ready for low-altitude flying tests: CEO

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyberport CEO Rocky Cheng said on Thursday that the park was well-positioned for low-altitude flying trials with its ample space and a pier, adding that there were plans to set up a landing port for test flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  As a venue partner for sandbox pilot projects for developing low-altitude economy, Cyberport will provide suitable locations and supporting facilities for drones and other aerial technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheng said the park had what it takes for low-altitude flight tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Cyberport's geographical environment is very suitable for conducting low-altitude economy trials. The new Phase 5 building, set to open in the third quarter of next year, offers a stunning sea view. There is also a 150-metre-long pier adjacent to the ocean, and ample space within Cyberport,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng outlined plans to set up a landing port at the pier and organise exhibitions on drones to educate the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the AI supercomputing centre due to start operation at the end of this year, Cheng said it was progressing well with some computing power already available for use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the centre hoped to start off by providing 1,300 petaflops of computing power, before bringing it up to 1,700 by next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government wants to develop and promote AI to help various industries in Hong Kong surpass other advanced economies, so this computing power serves as crucial infrastructure. We should see gradual increases in computing capacity in the future. I believe it will quickly exceed 10,000 petaflops,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrick Sin, who chairs the committee on a HK$3 billion subsidy scheme to help AI researchers and companies make the best use of Cyberport's computing power, said the project marked the start of a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I personally believe this is the opening of the AI era… So I think if more investment and more initiatives are provided by the government, I think that will give Hong Kong a further push to give more experts, professionals, to have more chance to exercise what they want to show to innovate and to benefit Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin added that the scheme, which opened for application in October, will favour firms that have expertise in research and development, and present innovative ideas that benefit the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation said on Friday that normal services are resuming on the East Rail line after an equipment fault on a train near University Station caused delays.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the train had been moved and services were returning to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The problem caused delays of up to fifteen minutes on the East Rail line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau.

    Ohtani, Judge win 2024 MLB MVP awards

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honour on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, 30, was a unanimous MVP for the third time, receiving all 30 first-place votes and 420 points in voting by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points, and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVP's here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me – which I think he’ll do.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani was unanimously voted the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting. He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record US$700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first player to twice become an unanimous MVP. He combined with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023 for the first year both MVP's were unanimous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He helped the Dodgers to the World Series title, playing the final three games with a torn labrum in his left shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter to win an MVP. He joined Frank Robinson for Cincinnati in 1961 and Baltimore in 1966 as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds with seven and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout with three each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Balloting was conducted before the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. (AP)

 Red Bull Italy SailGP Team was on Thursday unveiled as the 12th and final entry for the 2025 SailGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Jimmy Spithill, who serves as the team's CEO and founder, the team will make its debut this weekend at the Emirates Dubai Sail Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian lineup includes double Olympic gold medallist Ruggero Tita as driver and twice world bronze medallist Giulia Fava as strategist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the team are three-time SailGP champion Kyle Langford, who made a surprise move from Australia, and grinders Matteo Celon and Enrico Voltolini, both veterans of America’s Cup racing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s debut comes after Spithill announced plans to form an Italian team following his departure from the US SailGP Team last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is one of two new entries in the global league this season, alongside the Mubadala Brazil SailGP Team.
  <br>
  <br>
  SailGP is an international sailing competition featuring high-speed races in identical F50 foiling catamarans, capable of reaching speeds exceeding 100 km/h.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league pits national teams against each other in a series of regattas held across iconic locations worldwide. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Jannik Sinner triumphed in singles and doubles to help Davis Cup holders Italy beat Argentina 2-1 on Thursday to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italy will face Australia after they earlier defeated record 32-time winners the United States with a tense 2-1 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first two Grand Slams this season, as well as triumphing at the ATP Finals last week without dropping a set, and blew Sebastian Baez away 6-2, 6-1 after Francisco Cerundolo comfortably beat Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 in the opening rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decisive doubles battle, Sinner and Matteo Berrettini shaded Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez 6-4, 7-5 to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they put me on the court in doubles I try my best," said Sinner. "Matteo played unbelievable today, he carried me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy booked a third consecutive return to the semi-finals and are favourites to win the Davis Cup for a second year running, in no small part because of Sinner's presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old is still waiting for the outcome of the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner beat Novak Djokovic in singles and doubles in last year's semi-finals on the way to helping Italy end a 47-year wait to lift the trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't have time to adapt to this court after the ATP Finals, so I'm very happy with how I handled the situation today," Sinner told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very good doubles pairing, he played unbelievable," he added. "I tried to stay there with Berrettini, he also gave me a lot of confidence to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  The doubles teams were tied until the ninth game of the first set when Sinner won three points and then Molteni clipped his passing shot which was heading wide to hand Italy the decisive solitary break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set was even tighter with Italy breaking for a 6-5 lead and sealing their victory with a Sinner smash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini more than held his own alongside Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're playing with Jannik the pressure is off a little bit, he's going to play great," said the world number 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's captain Guillermo Coria said he was pleased with his team taking Italy to the wire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It speaks of the respect Italy have for us, and my doubles pairing, that they put the world number one out there," he said. "We were close to taking out a powerful team like Italy." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian teenager died on Thursday after drinking alcohol contaminated with methanol in Laos, Thai police and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, the fourth foreign national now suspected to have died in the incident.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bianca Jones, 19, fell ill last week in Vang Vieng, a town in the Southeast Asian nation popular with foreign backpackers that is about two hours north of the capital Vientiane by road.
  <br>
  <br>
  She died on Thursday after being taken to a hospital in neighbouring Thailand on November 13, police in the city of Udon Thani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The physician who examined her said the cause of death was a methanol poisoning, from fake liquor," Phattanawong Chanphon, a police official in the Thai city, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of methanol in her body was high, leading to swelling of the brain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian media said Jones was the fourth foreign tourist to die after consuming the contaminated alcohol, following two Danes and an American.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure," Albanese told parliament on Thursday. "All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones' friend Holly Bowles, also 19, is in critical condition and on life support, her father Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurious liquor is a problem in Laos, with the governments of Australia and Britain warning citizens to be cautious when taking drinks there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowles and Jones stayed at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng last week and drank at the hostel’s bar before they went out for the evening, Australian media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  They failed to check out on November 13, when hostel staff rushed the pair to the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vietnamese manager of the hostel has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No charges have been made, however, as police are still "investigating," an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. (Agencies)

    Duct-taped banana sells for US$6.2m at auction

<div class="itemFullText">
 A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for US$6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Comedian," by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on art collectors. At one point, performance artist David Datuna took the banana off the wall and ate it, saying he felt "hungry" while inspecting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between US$120,000 and US$150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted  attention at the auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana, which was bought from a Bangladeshi fruit seller on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The New York Times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bidding started at US$800,000 and within minutes shot up to US$2 million, then US$3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked "Don't let it slip away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Don’t miss this opportunity," Barker said. "These are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana."
  <br>
  <br>
  The final hammer price announced in the room was US$5.2 million, which did not include the about US$1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sun said the piece "represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community". But he said the latest version of "Comedian" will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sotheby’s calls Cattelan "among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways," the auction house said in a description of "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for other works such as a golden toilet called "America", Cattelan has explained the banana work as a critical commentary on the art market, which he has criticised in the past for being speculative and failing to help artists. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The major US  indexes closed higher after choppy trading on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 hitting one-week high.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dow Jones Industrial Average gains were aided by cloud company Salesforce's advances after three brokerages lifted their price targets on the stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Wall Street's biggest company, Nvidia, were up after initially choppy trading following its earnings release on Wednesday. The chip company surpassed expectations for quarterly results, and projected fourth-quarter revenue above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Nvidia's] earnings report was really, really good. Some of the whisper numbers were higher and they disappointed there, but the fundamentals of AI and Nvidia continue to fire on all cylinders and the outlook for next year is positive," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 percent to 43,870.35, the S&P 500 gained 0.53 percent to 5,948.49 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up fractionally to end barely changed at 18,972.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alphabet slid to touch a four-week low after the Justice Department argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its monopoly on online search.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock's losses weighed on the communication services sector, which was a drag on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com fell after a report said it will likely face an EU investigation next year into whether it favours its own brand products on its online marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the data front, a weekly report on jobless claims showed they fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from Federal Reserve officials before the mid-December FOMC meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Money-market bets point to a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ve moved on from the election a bit, we got the Nvidia report, so the next thing markets will look for is the Fed meeting, and some policy speak from Fed officials this week have pointed to maybe a pause in the making for December," Saglimbene said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said the United States is more vulnerable to inflationary shocks than in the past, according to a media report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he supports further interest rate cuts and is open to doing them more slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders also monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia that sent crude prices higher and aided a gain in the energy sector.
  <br>

  Shares of machinery manufacturer Deere gained after reporting an upbeat fourth-quarter profit, while AI company Snowflake jumped after raising its annual product revenue forecast. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has extended a warm welcome to two of the country’s navy vessels - a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship - that are making a port visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday, the arrival of The Changsha and The Hainan was greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, Lee said a slew of activities have been arranged during their five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes Hongkongers can take the opportunity to experience the country’s achievements in national defence and military modernisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Crew members will take part in activities with local people and the SAR garrison. I believe this will raise awareness here of the nation's achievements in naval construction and development, while strengthening a sense of national identity and pride, especially among the younger generation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of mainland officials were also present at the welcoming ceremony, including Vice Admiral Wei Wenhui, deputy commander of the Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as director of the liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong.

<img alt="The move comes after the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan (pictured) announced on May 20, that he was seeking arrest warrants.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In their decision to grant the warrants, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant for Al-Masri lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, including rape and the taking of hostages. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Israel has said it killed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were a "mark of shame" for the court. Israel's main opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the court's move, calling it "a reward for terrorism".
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu or Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its member states for that. ICC members include all European Union countries, Britain, Japan, Brazil, Australia and Canada, and in the Middle East region the Palestinian territories and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos under its global anti-corruption sanctions regime, the British government said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos, whose father Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years until 2017, has faced corruption accusations in Angola and elsewhere for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Africa's first female billionaire denies the allegations and says she is the target of a long-running political vendetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said dos Santos misappropriated more than 50 million pounds (US$63.19 million) for her own financial benefit while she run Angolan state oil firm Sonangol.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said she misappropriated more than 300 million pounds while she was director of telecoms company Unitel .
  <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos lost an appeal to overturn an order freezing up to 580 million pounds of her assets in September as part a lawsuit at London's High Court brought by Unitel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global police agency Interpol confirmed in 2022 it had issued a red notice for dos Santos, who says she lives in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British government has added seven other designations targeting other individuals under the same global anti-corruption case. (Reuters)

<img alt="Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780282_1_20241121191829.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Texas authorities have offered the incoming Trump administration land on the border with Mexico to build "deportation facilities" in support of the president-elect's plan for the mass removal of undocumented migrants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out the mass deportation of undocumented migrants after taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Texas General Land Office announced that commissioner Dawn Buckingham has offered him more than 1,400 acres (570 hectares) of public land on the US southern border "to aid his administration in carrying out their deportation plans".
  <br>
  <br>
  The plot of land is a ranch along the Rio Grande river -- serving as a border between the United States and Mexico -- in Starr county. It was acquired by the office in late October, the statement from the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter dated Tuesday, Buckingham said she had authorized a 1.5-mile easement on the ranch to allow "the Texas Border Wall to be built" after the land was acquired.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her office was "fully prepared" to work with US federal agencies to "allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump has repeatedly railed against undocumented migrants during the election campaign, blaming them for "poisoning the blood" of the country and highlighting violent crimes perpetrated by members of the migrant community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before his first term as president, he had pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but the project was never completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said he would "marshal every lever of power to secure the border", according to US broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities estimate that about 11 million people are living in the United States illegally -- many fleeing violence or economic troubles in their countries and looking for a better life in America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's deportation plan is expected to impact around 20 million families. (AFP)

    Taichi Kho 'solid' as Thai star leads HK Open

<img alt="Taichi Kho says he got off to a slow start before playing better on day one of the Hong Kong Open. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780280_1_20241121190146.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local golfing sensation Taichi Kho said he had a "solid day" at the office as he shot a three-under 67 in the opening round of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  That put the Hong Kong, China star tied for 20th place, five shots off the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand led the pack at the end of day one with a sizzling round of eight-under 62.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appearing in his second Hong Kong Open, the 24-year-old Kho braved the rainy and windy conditions and teed off in a group comprising 2015 champion Justin Rose and American Patrick Reed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was a solid day overall," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Got off to a bit of a slow start, but I feel like Patrick [Reed] and Justin [Rose] were very encouraging of me to play well out there today, which allowed me to feed off of their energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learned a lot from how they played, which helped me get my momentum going midway through the round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the putts didn't quite drop, I still felt like I played well towards the end and did a lot of good things out there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho is bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open after his historic victory at the World City Championship last year made him the first Hong Kong player to win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand, along with Australian Kevin Yuan and Kazuki Higa of Japan, were a shot behind Nitithorn at seven under 63, tied for second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the other top finishers from the SAR, Jason Hak had a round of 66 and Michael Wong, like Kho, shot a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kho, the Hong Kong Open serves as a test match for the 2025 National Games, where he is set to compete in the event co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely want to represent Hong Kong, China," Kho said, as he weighed in on the opportunity to compete for the SAR on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This course has stood the test of time. It's one of the best ones we play out on tour, making it a great venue for the upcoming Games."

 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

  Officers said they believe a syndicate arranged for sex workers to come to the SAR from countries including Japan, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Tang Hoi-tung said the 65 were arrested on suspicion of living on earnings of prostitution, controlling prostitution, money laundering, keeping a vice establishment and breaching conditions of stay in Hong Kong.

    MTR to reduce platform gaps at three stations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said its has finished installing platform screen doors at nine stations along the East Rail Line.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator said it expects to finish putting doors in at three more stations, Lo Wu, Mong Kok East and University Station, next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief engineering manager for system integration Maggie Chan said the gap between trains and the platform is relatively wide at these three stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the rail operator will reduce the gap when the automatic platform gates (APG) are installed, to ensure passenger safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the platform edge, there are the platform gap fillers. We will also widen the platform gap fillers to reduce the platform gap," Chan told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also have extra, additional broadcasting, so as to remind the passengers they have to pay attention to the platform gap after the APG opens."

    Enterprises improving defences against cyber attacks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An index measuring local enterprises' ability to respond to cybersecurity attacks has recorded the biggest jump to date, up by 5.8 points from last year to 52.8.
 <br>
  <br>
  442 companies were measured under the "Hong Kong Enterprise Cyber Security Readiness Index" compiled by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the four areas covered in the index, "Human Awareness Building" has the most urgent need for improvement, the bodies said. The category refers to how aware and cautious employees are regarding potential cyber attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said this awareness has remained relatively low over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage enterprises to conduct training regularly, and this will include for example cyber security drill exercises as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said many hackers have been using AI to carry out their attacks, and deepfake videos used to fake identities can be made in under 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, General Manager of Digital Transformation at the HKPC, said enterprises are encouraged to adopt AI for defence, such as detecting the voice prints of videos to check if they show a real person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will always say that AI is a double-edged sword. So that means attackers or bad actors are using AI to do attack, at the same time we should also use AI to uplift our defence," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help enterprises better equip themselves against cyber attacks, the PCPD and the HKPC will be introducing a series of training packages, including a "data security training series for Small-and-Medium Enterprises" in 2025 and one on "Phishing Defence Services".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation by the city's Ombudsman has found it is common for rental bike service operators to leave their bicycles where they block paths, saying the situation "invites doubts" as to whether the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) has taken action against offenders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday said business permits issued by the department to the operators explicitly forbid them from allowing rental bicycles to take up space outside designated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Operators placing their bicycles outside the permit area in violation of regulations not only causes an obstruction to passageways and affects members of the public to access and use recreational facilities, but may also pose safety hazards," said Ombudsman Jack Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our multiple site inspections found that it seems to be a common practice for operators to leave bicycles lying around in contravention of the regulations, and this has invited doubts as to whether the LCSD had reminded the operators of the irregularities or has taken enforcement action against them in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that LCSD staff issue reminders or warning letters depending on the severity of a situation, and can consider suspending an operator's business or terminating the contract if there's no evident improvement after a third warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  But guidelines do not clearly stipulate the number of verbal and written reminders to warrant a warning, the office said, or whether the notices have any validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said the department should take "decisive enforcement action" if any operator violates the contract terms, and look into enhancing the current enforcement regime and guidelines, among other suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ombudsman added that the LCSD has accepted all of its recommendations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 John Prescott, deputy prime minister to Britain's Tony Blair during his 10 years in government, has died aged 86 after a battle with Alzheimer's, his family said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prescott, who served under Blair from 1997 to 2007, was known as a plain-speaking politician who bridged the divide between the traditional left-wing and the modernisers in the Labour Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dubbed an old-school political "bruiser", he famously punched a member of the public during an election campaign in 2001, after he had been hit by an egg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, it would have all been better if it hadn't happened," Blair said at the time. But added: "John is John".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott was born on May 31, 1938, in a seaside house in Wales. His father was a railway signalman, his mother a maid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 17, he went to sea as a steward on a luxury cruise ship where boxing bouts were organised among the crew to entertain the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into politics after coming ashore and he attended Oxford's Ruskin College, which offered courses for mature students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott entered parliament in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming a key player in the Labour Party's historic three election victories from 1997 to 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acted as a peace broker in the often fraught relationship between Blair and his future successor, Gordon Brown, and was later called "Two Jags" after he used his ministerial car for a 200 yard journey, which he said was needed to prevent his wife's hair from being blown about in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair said he was devastated by the news.

 Two of the nation's navy battleships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship,  arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday for a five-day visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public can board the vessels for a look around.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Changsha and the Hainan were greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department, with the Hainan moored at China Merchants Wharf in Western.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers on board raised the national flag and waved to people on shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Defence said the visit was approved by the Central Military Commission and is part of an annual plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the visit is aimed at demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's determination and ability to defend the country's sovereignty and safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The visit also] further enhances the national identity and pride for compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, and for them to learn more about national defence and the achievements of the army's modernisation," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the vessels will be open to the public and soldiers based in the two SARs, and there will be seminars on national defence as well as cultural exchange activities.

 A senior Beijing official has stressed that Hong Kong is playing a larger part in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the city's dispute resolution mechanism and an abundance of legal professionals provide services under the country's infrastructure development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guangyuan, a deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, on Thursday said the SAR is "standing at the forefront" of the nation's opening up as an important functional platform for the initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Belt and Road conference in Hong Kong, the official said the One Country, Two Systems principle makes the territory a bridge connecting the mainland with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the only jurisdiction in the world with a bilingual common law system, and has a bigger role to play in facilitating Belt and Road cooperation," Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a complete dispute resolution mechanism, and serves as a preferred seat for resolving disputes among countries along the Belt and Road... The abundant legal talent reservoir in the city may be further tapped into to provide legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability is a "prerequisite" for prosperity in Hong Kong and a safeguard for the city's role in the development initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, for his part, said at the same conference that Hong Kong has a special role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is renowned for having a sound and mature legal system, supported by the independent exercise of judicial power by our courts and a strong rule of law tradition. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps between different jurisdictions along the Belt and Road," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a super-connector and a super value-adder, Hong Kong provides world-class legal services that facilitate business between China and the rest of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has a lot of legal professionals "with a strong Chinese legal and business background" as well as expertise in international law and practice, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will proactively integrate into the nation's development, maintain a free and open business environment, and serve as a springboard to attract and support enterprises.
