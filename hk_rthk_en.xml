<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the first time since the depths of the 2020 pandemic, saying progress had been made on inflation though it was still cautious about the outlook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.10 percent, ending more than a year of steady policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It offered little guidance on whether it would ease again at the next board meeting in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had wagered heavily on a quarter-point cut after core inflation surprised on the downside in the fourth quarter at 3.2 percent and looked certain to re-enter the RBA's 2-3 percent target band this quarter. (Reuters)

<img alt="John Lee says the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will be a historic moment for sports and culture. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792084_1_20250218122036.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park will mark a significant milestone in Hong Kong's sporting and cultural landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  An opening ceremony will begin at 6.30pm on March 1, with a joint broadcast at 9.30pm across four free TV channels, rather than being shown live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the broadcast arrangements, Lee said he believes the production company has tried its best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to make sure that members of the public will be able to view the event for free through the TV channels so that we can share the happiness with everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The production company will seek partners to help deal with all the challenges that they are going to face. In this regard I believe the production company has been working very hard. They're going to find the best solution within such a short period of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The park's opening is part of what is being billed as Hong Kong's "Super March", alongside Art Basel, ComplexCon, and the World Grand Prix snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the mega events scheduled for the first half of this year are expected to attract 840,000 tourists and generate HK$3.3 billion in spending.

 Hong Kong stocks soared past 23,000 in Tuesday morning trade, as investors cheered a meeting between President Xi Jinping and business leaders in Beijing the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index had opened higher, rising 0.21 percent at 22,664, before eclipsing the 23,000-mark for the first time in more than four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  By midday, the index put on 464 points, or more than 2 percent, at 23,080.

<img alt="John Lee says a taxi strike would not be good for society. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792076_1_20250218112557.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday urged the taxi industry to avoid "drastic action" such as strikes, warning such moves would harm the public interest and could be hijacked by people with bad motives.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association threatened a five-day strike from March 5 unless officials take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said strikes would not be good for society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any drastic action is not going to solve the problem. Drastic action may also hurt the interests of normal citizens in the course of their daily going about of their lives. It is not going to receive public support," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that many taxi drivers have said they wouldn't support strike action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Advisory Committee will meet representatives from both the taxi industry and ride-hailing platforms on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<img alt="John Lee thanks Xia Baolong for laying out the directions for Hong Kong's development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792074_1_20250218112237.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that he's all for his ministers reaching out to the community and explaining their work, including to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the office, Xia Baolong, made a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area earlier this month and met with some of the SAR's ministers, when Lee was in Harbin attending the Asian Winter Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said Xia is a busy leader, and that he and the top mainland official maintain good communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also support my ministers in doing their work in their own right... I support them in explaining issues to different people and reporting their work to the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, especially in explaining their specific portfolio to Director Xia personally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This precisely reflects my demands for different ministers to do their own part, taking charge of their responsibilities in resolving problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And at the same time, there's synergy among the team, united as one, complementing each other in handling problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he wanted to once again thank Xia for pointing the way forward for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said Xia exchanged views with a number of SAR government officials on how Hong Kong will speed up reform and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area's development. During his trip, he visited the Hetao Innovation and Technology Cooperation Zone, as well as Qianhai and Yantian.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Protesters against US President Donald Trump and his policies braved frigid temperatures in parts of  America on Monday, shouting “No kings on Presidents Day” in East Coast cities and attempting to enter the Arizona Statehouse to oppose a bill that would bolster fast-changing federal immigration enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Florida and California, local media outlets reported on hundreds of protesters carrying out “Not my Presidents Day” protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The “No Kings" theme was orchestrated by the 50501 Movement, and marked the second set of protests criss-crossing the nation in less than two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar nationwide event on February 5 drew participants in dozens of cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sets of rallies denounced Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the leader of Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, an outside-government organisation designed to slash federal spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 1,000 people marched in the snow from the Statehouse in Boston to City Hall, chanting “Elon Musk has got to go” and other slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The temperature was below freezing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston protesters, some dressed in Revolutionary War-style clothing, carried signs saying such things as “This is a Coup” and “Cowards Bow to Trump, Patriots Stand Up.” One sign had a depiction of Uncle Sam saying “I Want You to Resist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it was important to be here on Presidents Day to demonstrate for what America stands for,” said Emily Manning, 55, a Boston engineer who came to the rally with her two teenage sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  “American values are not the values of the plutocracy or the limited few rich people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of Monday’s protests, which were focused on state capitals and major cities including Washington, DC; Orlando, Florida; and Seattle, said they were targeting “anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies.”
  <br>
  <br>
  One sign at the rally that attracted hundreds in the nation's capital said, “Deport Musk Dethrone Trump.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rallies followed a series of Trump executive orders and came just days after layoffs across federal agencies as part of an effort to reduce the government workforce. (AP)

    Argentina's president denies role in 'cryptogate' scam

<img alt="Authorities are investigating Argentina's President Javier Milei for his promotion of a cryptocurrency which crashed within hours of its launch last week. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792070_1_20250218105528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I acted in good faith," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it strongly condemns unfounded malicious attacks online, after a court issued an order to confiscate the alleged crime proceeds of self-exiled national security suspect, Ted Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of First Instance issued the confiscation order on Monday upon application by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement overnight, a government spokesman accused Hui of committing numerous crimes, including conspiring with foreign politicians in 2020 to forge documents and deceive the court, in order to jump bail and abscond overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before and after Hui Chi-fung absconded from Hong Kong, he transferred nearly $2.5 million Hong Kong dollars in personal assets as gifts to his mother and wife," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government spokesman said such a gift made within six years from the date of prosecution may be regarded as the defendant's property, and confiscated under the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said it was common practice to confiscate crime proceeds, and denied that private property could be 'confiscated at any time' or 'arbitrarily', as such orders must comply with strict conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include that the court must be satisfied the absconded defendant could have been convicted of the offence and whether they benefited from the offence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic has urged tennis authorities to overhaul the sport's anti-doping system, pointing to "inconsistencies" in cases involving top stars Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek and those of lower-ranked players.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner agreed to a three-month ban on Saturday, admitting "partial responsibility" for mistakes by his team which led to him twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was facing a potential ban of two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his initial exoneration by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprising move, WADA withdrew its appeal and came to an agreement with Sinner to accept a three-month ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-profile case last year, five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a majority of the players that I've talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It seems like, it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the recently retired Simona Halep, a former world number one, was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug roxadustat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She argued it was the result of a tainted supplement and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which reduced her suspension to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have gotten the ban for years," said Djokovic. "There is so much inconsistencies between the cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who is returning to action this week at the Qatar Open for the first time since retiring injured from last month's Australian Open semi-finals, believes a change is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work for anti-doping, it's obvious," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes," he added. "It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what's happening, then there's no consistency, then there is no transparency, and some cases are transparent, some are not," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and ITIA, and the whole process." (AFP)

    Plane flips upside down in Toronto crash, 18 injured

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Delta Air Lines jet with 80 people onboard crash-landed on Monday at Toronto's main airport, officials said, flipping upside down and leaving at least 18 people injured but causing no deaths.
 <br>
  <br>
  Endeavor Air Flight 4819 with 76 passengers and four crew was landing in the afternoon in Canada's largest metropolis, having flown from Minneapolis in the US state of Minnesota, the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No explanation of the cause of the accident, or how the plane ended up flipped with its wings clipped, has been provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very early on. It's really important that we do not speculate. What we can say is the runway was dry and there were no crosswind conditions," said Todd Aitken, the airport's fire chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  He confirmed that 18 people had been injured in the accident, with no fatalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the wounded, including those with minor injuries, were taken to area hospitals either by ambulance or helicopter, said the paramedic services' Lawrence Saindon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dramatic images on local broadcasts and shared on social media showed people stumbling away from the upside down CRJ-900 plane, shielding their faces from strong gusts of wind and blowing snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire crews appeared to douse the aircraft with water as smoke wafted from the fuselage and as passengers were still exiting the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's North America correspondent Simon Marks said it had been snowing at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The images in which through the snow that was enveloping the airport, you could just make out the visual of a CRJ-900 regional jet that had crash at the airport and somehow ended up…literally upside down on the runway."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto airport authority chief executive Deborah Flint told a news conference the incident did not involve any other planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews were "heroic" in their response, she said, "reaching the site within minutes and quickly evacuating the passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them "have already been reunited with their friends and their families," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport suspended all flights after the incident, before resuming them at around 5:00pm EST, more than two hours later. It said passengers should expect long delays.

    Govt announces second phase of light public flats

<img alt="Housing minister Winnie Ho, second left, says she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792012_1_20250217212430.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Bureau on Monday announced a new phase of light public flats, and people can begin moving in from the fourth quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase covers four projects in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun and Sheung Shui, generating 5,060 units with monthly rents between HK$860 and HK$3,270.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can submit their applications from February 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, housing minister Winnie Ho said she expects the projects to receive an overwhelming response, especially the one in Kai Tak adjacent to the MTR station
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing projects can effectively help residents in need. The locations of the second phase projects are very appealing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have about 5,000 units this time, and together with the 4,400 units announced in the first phase, we have introduced almost 10,000 flats. That is one-third of the total number."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who's the deputy chairman of the Legco housing panel, said while the projects would help reduce the waiting time for public housing, the focus should still be building more public flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing is not for the long term. Some of the residents also have to move again after they [are allocated with] a public housing flat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, even though the waiting time will be shortened, we hope that the government can keep providing more public housing in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government aims to build a total of about 30,000 light public flats by 2028 under the scheme aimed at filling the short-term gap of public housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the projects announced in the first phase last year, Ho said people would start moving into the units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok from March and June respectively.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The so-called "update" to the Taiwan fact sheet displayed on the US State Department website is another example of Washington using the Taiwan question to contain China, and China urges the US to immediately correct its mistakes, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department removed a line on its website stating that it does not support "Taiwan independence".
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo reiterated that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the whole of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it is a prevailing international consensus and basic norm governing international relations, and also a solemn commitment the US has made in the three China-US joint communiqués.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo stressed that the revision made by the US State Department gravely backpedalled on its position on Taiwan-related issues, and has sent a severely wrong signal to "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to immediately correct its wrongdoings, abide by the one-China principle and three China-US joint communiqués," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, urged the US to handle the Taiwan question with the "greatest prudence" and stop sending any wrong signals that condone or abet "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revision was a "severe regression" regarding the US stance on the Taiwan question, she added. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Europe's security is at a turning point, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday, as she arrived in Paris for an emergency meeting to address Washington's shock policy shift on the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Europe's security is at a turning point. Yes, it is about Ukraine - but it is also about us. We need an urgency mindset. We need a surge in defence. And we need both of them now," she said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leaders from key European powers gathered in France to strategise after US President Donald Trump blindsided allies by launching efforts with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris talks come as Washington said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would on Tuesday meet with a Russian delegation including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Riyadh ahead of a future meeting between Trump and Putin in the Saudi capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Council chief Antonio Costa, who was also participating, said the meeting was "the beginning of a process, that will continue with the involvement of all the partners committed to peace and security in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European Union and its Member States will play a central role in this process," he wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe is scrambling to come up with plans to ensure any peace deal in Ukraine is lasting, with Britain saying it would be willing to deploy peacekeepers if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris meeting was to bring together the heads of government of Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain, as well as the heads of the European Council, the European Commission and Nato. (AFP)

 Hong Kong universities have seen a surge in non-local students, after the government doubled the enrolment ceiling for them to 40 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  So, how are these students adjusting to life here? And what efforts are being made to help them feel at home?
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to the warden and some students at St. John's College -- University of Hong Kong’s oldest residential hall -- to find out more.

    Baby's heart thrives after cross-boundary transplant

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities said the heart of a baby who received a successful cross-boundary organ donation is functioning well, with little post-operative bleeding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight month-old Whitney underwent a heart transplant on Sunday and is now in intensive care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have at least a dozen of these monitoring lines attached to Whitney. We have minute-by-minute monitoring for at least a dozen of these parameters, and this is coupled with another list of interval monitoring like echocardiograms to look at the heart function, and radiographers to look at the chest conditions," said Dr Nicholson Yam, the head surgeon of the operation from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a team of dedicated nurses to look at the surgical wound condition, the bleeding conditions from the tubes that we place after surgery, and this will continue at least for the coming weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yam said this was the baby's third open-heart surgery, presenting challenges such as removing the previously implanted biventricular assist device and minimising ischemia time -- the period during which tissue, such as a heart, is deprived of blood supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of work has been done before to make sure the logistics [are] as smooth as possible, all the transportation, all the cross-boundary action, and then the transport to the Children's Hospital is as fast as possible, as smooth as possible," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Whitney's surgery, the main challenge was it was the third time the chest was opened, so she had two previous chest openings for heart surgery. We have expected quite a bit of scarring tissue inside the chest and that will make the heart removal procedure technically more challenging."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Tang, director of cluster services at the Hospital Authority, said close communication with mainland authorities -- specifically strengthened collaboration with the centre for the China Organ Transplant Response System -- was essential for ensuring a smooth cross-boundary organ transplant.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the first successful cross-boundary organ donation was in 2022 with a then four-month-old baby girl.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We established the communication channels and we also established the essential pathway. So in case if we have suitable grafts in mainland China, but there is no suitable recipients in mainland China, then this graft, we will see if it can be matched to a potential recipient in Hong Kong," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key step is we need good preparations and so in these two years we have already set up various guidelines and protocols, so that we can ensure ... things can go smooth."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Cheung, Whitney's father, expressed his gratitude to the medical team, relevant departments and the donor's family for saving his daughter's life, calling the procedure a miracle.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP & agencies)

    'Improve transparency for bring your own cup schemes'

<img alt="The council found that tea shops tend to provide more information about BYOC schemes than other types of beverage stores. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791983_1_20250217171151.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has urged beverage shops to enhance their training for staff on bring-your-own-cup (BYOC) policies, adding there was a lack of transparency about such schemes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, it also saw cases where paper cups were used to make drinks even when customers brought their own cups, which failed to reduce waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog on Monday said it had sent staff undercover to conduct BYOC trials at 20 beverage shops.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYOC refers to schemes by drink shops, ranging from coffee shops to hand-shaken beverage shops, which encourage customers to bring their own cups instead of using plastic or paper ones in order to save waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often, this is accompanied by incentives such as a five dollar discount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer Council CEO Gilly Wong said one problem was shops' inability to properly provide relevant information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you just simply say small, tall, may be standard, normal or similar words to describe the size of your drinks, but unfortunately you haven't provided exact size... then it's very hard for people to follow," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that often customers do not know such a scheme exists since it is not consistently displayed, appearing in small letters at the bottom of the poster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, problems also arise when staff are not be properly trained, leading to misunderstandings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings, there are a couple of times that the shop staff didn't know such offer [existed] and said they didn't have the offer, or missed the discount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong suggested that merchants look into the details of their workflow to ensure the minimisation of waste and to better display their schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called for efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of China's private sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks when attending a symposium on private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said the private sector enjoys broad prospects and great potential on the new journey in the new era, and it is a prime time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to give full play to their capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for efforts to reach consensus and firming up confidence, to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all private enterprises and private entrepreneurs will have the ambition to serve the country, strive for development, operate in accordance with the law and promote common prosperity, so as to make new and greater contributions to promoting Chinese-style modernisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that policies regarding the private sector would not change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president delivered the speech after listening to representatives of private companies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang were among those attending the symposium, which was presided over by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Huning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment, a meeting which would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. (Xinhua & agencies)

    S'pore opposition leader guilty of lying to parliament

<img alt="Singapore's Workers' Party Chief Pritam Singh walks outside the State Courts in Singapore. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791965_1_20250217140348.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Singapore's opposition leader was fined on Monday for lying to parliament while helping a fellow party member cover up a false witness account, but narrowly avoided being barred from contesting upcoming national elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pritam Singh, 48, secretary-general of the Workers' Party, was found guilty on two counts of lying to a parliamentary committee probing a fellow MP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conviction comes as the Southeast Asian nation's political opposition seeks to challenge the dominance of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in elections expected within months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PAP has ruled Singapore since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  District court judge Luke Tan said that contrary to what he told the committee, Singh had not done enough to get rookie MP Raeesah Khan to admit to her lie in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also gave credence to Khan's testimony that Singh had told her during a meeting to "take the lie to the grave."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh told reporters outside court that based on "advice I have and that I've been given, I will be running for the general elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been advised that the law is quite clear," he said, adding he understood the elections department would release a statement later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not going to be an easy election... we'll have to fight hard, and that's what we will do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who said he would appeal the court's decision, was fined Sg$7,000 for each charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The path of choosing opposition politics is not for the faint hearted," Singh said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, a person fined a minimum of Sg$10,000 (US$7,400) or jailed for at least one year, is disqualified from running for election or holding a parliamentary seat for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will not be disqualified as the threshold of $10,000 fine per charge is not crossed. You can't stack up the fines," Eugene Tan, who teaches constitutional law at Singapore Management University, told reporters. (AFP)

    Many nappy creams contain allergens: Consumer Council
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said around 75 percent of nappy cream samples it tested contained fragrances or chemicals that can cause irritation or allergic reactions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 16 nappy creams priced from HK$52 to HK$218.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them claimed to be suitable for use on infants, with three types also suitable for adults or the elderly who need to wear adult diapers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven samples contained fragrances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of them had one or two types of fragrant substances, but Weleda baby's sample had six types.
  <br>
  <br>
  Essential oils or plant extracts were found in four samples, including the aromatic compound terpenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European medicines regulatory body has warned that terpenes can cause adverse neurologic effects such as twitches in babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two samples, a diaper rash cream from Baby Sebamed, and QV baby’s nappy cream, contain preservatives restricted in the United States and France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said those ingredients may worsen diaper rashes or cause allergenic reactions like dermatitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If nappy creams contain ingredients of concern, they are more likely to irritate the skin, pose allergy risks or may even cause adverse neurologic effects,” said chairman of the council’s committee on research and testing Chung Chi-yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Infants, having thinner skin and a higher body surface area-to-body weight ratio, are particularly susceptible to allergic reactions,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to improve their labelling by listing all ingredients clearly, including their concentrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also pay attention to the latest international regulations to improve product formulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also hoped local regulatory bodies would establish regulations on the safety and labelling of nappy creams.

    Over 5,000 people flock to Ocean Park for panda twins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 5,000 people flocked to Ocean Park for the panda twins' debut, its chairman revealed on Monday, saying the figures fell within expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong said that dozens of people arrived at the park gates at 6am, four hours before the start of public viewings.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted entry to facility was smooth as several drills had been conducted earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turnout marked a daily record high at the Giant Panda Adventure exhibition zone, Pong said, with a majority of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included annual pass holders, who are devoted fans of pandas. There were also visitors from around the world and the mainland, including Chengdu. Many people from foreign countries, like Southeast Asia, or even Europe and America, came to see the pandas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the tourists actually didn't know about the twins when they arrived at Ocean Park, but when they heard they could visit the cubs, they also queued to meet them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewing of the twins, whom Ying Ying gave birth to last August, is for five hours daily – from 10am to 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pong said visiting hours could be extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they're more adapted to meeting the public, or even when they can be in the same exhibition zone with Ying Ying, then we can gradually extend the duration."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Ocean Park received hundreds of applications for the HK$1,500 VIP session to meet the cubs for 30 minutes before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first session will be held on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong emphasised that income generated from the special tour would be used for its conservation fund after deducting expenses.

    Team Shaq wins NBA All-Star revamp as James sits out

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shaq's OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament in NBA history, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry to beat Chuck's Global Stars 41-25 in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was over early, as the Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victor Wembanyama – the first-time All-Star who vowed that he would play hard, and did – led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format – four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league went to the tournament format of untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game, with Nikola Jokic missing both shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Shaq's win came on the heels of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James' annoucement of his withdrawal from the game prior to tip-off, citing a nagging ankle and foot injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will not see anything from me tonight," James, 40, said. "Unfortunately I will not be in uniform tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately," he added. "You know I hate that. But I'm looking forward to seeing the format." (AP/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ready to send UK troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force as he tried to show the US that European nations should have a role in the talks on ending the conflict.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said he had not taken the decision to consider putting British servicemen and women "in harm's way" lightly, but securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to deter further aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday said Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end Moscow's war, signalling that US talks with Russia this week were a chance to see how serious Putin is about peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again," Starmer wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's comments were the first time he has explicitly said he is considering deploying British peacekeepers to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously said that Britain was willing to help play a part in any peace deal that is negotiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Starmer said he was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is expected to join German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other European leaders in Paris on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron convened talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump stunned European allies in Nato and Ukraine last week when he announced he had held a call with Putin without consulting them and would start a peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, then suggested Ukraine and other European leaders would have no place at peace negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials are expected to meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Russia's nearly three-year war in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    'Conclave' and 'Brutalist' share Bafta honours

<img alt='The cast and crew of "Conclave" pose for a picture after the movie won the Best Film award at the 2025 Bafta awards. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791943_1_20250217110853.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Papal thriller "Conclave" and immigrant epic "The Brutalist" on Sunday tied for top honours at Britain's Bafta awards with each film picking up four coveted gongs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Conclave", directed by German-born Edward Berger, won the Bafta for the best film with its tale of the intrigue and horse-trading behind the scenes during the election of a new pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accepting the award, Berger recalled the journey to make the film took seven years, paying tribute to British screenplay writer Peter Straughan's "wonderful script" and lead actor Ralph Fiennes.
  <br>
  <br>
  US filmmaker Brady Corbet took the Bafta for best director for "The Brutalist", while leading man Adrien Brody scooped up the best actor gong for his portrayal of a Hungarian Holocaust survivor and architect who emigrates to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brody told a winners press conference that the film was "an opportunity for me to honour my own ancestral struggles".
  <br>
  <br>
  In "a film that speaks to tremendous cruelty and despicable behaviour in our past... we see elements existing today that can guide us and remind us of that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran British actor Fiennes, who played a cardinal in "Conclave", once again saw his hopes of winning a Bafta gong dashed, losing out to Brody in the race for the honour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scandal-hit "Emilia Perez", a surreal musical about a Mexican druglord who transitions to a woman, had been heavily favoured at the beginning of the year. But it ended the evening with just two Baftas, including one for Zoe Saldana for best supporting actress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until last month, French director Jacques Audiard's movie had been expected to be a frontrunner having won 11 nominations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But old racist and Islamophobic tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon surfaced at the end of January, shaking up the race just before the London ceremony and the Oscars on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise of the night was the Bafta for best actress which went to 25-year-old Mikey Madison for her portrayal of a sex worker in the black comedy "Anora" about an erotic dancer's whirlwind romance gone wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madison, who beat out frontrunner Demi Moore, told reporters she wanted to dedicate the award to "the sex worker community, I see you, you deserve respect and human dignity". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 India's capital New Delhi was jolted awake on Monday by powerful tremors from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake, with its epicentre on the edge of the sprawling megacity an hour before dawn.
 <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of major damage, but terrified residents rushed outside as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey said the quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow "safety precautions" and stay alert to "possible aftershocks".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tremors were felt in Delhi and nearby areas. Urging everyone to stay calm and follow safety precautions, staying alert for possible aftershocks. Authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation," Modi said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police issued an emergency number to call for help, saying: "We hope you all are safe, Delhi."
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern India lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. (AFP)

<img alt="Honourees of the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared gala say the event comes at a crucial time, as US President Donald Trump aggressively moves to stamp out diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791931_1_20250217101545.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 13 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Hers is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

    Trump expects to meet Putin 'very soon'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he could meet "very soon" with Vladimir Putin, adding he believes his Russian counterpart genuinely wants to stop fighting in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No time set, but it could be very soon," Trump told reporters, hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to play down expectations of upcoming high-level talks in Riyadh on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Rubio set to lead a high-level American delegation at the discussions with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia's capital in the coming days, a flurry of diplomacy was taking place as the Ukraine war nears its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, addressing reporters after a flight on Air Force One, said his team had been speaking "long and hard" with Russian officials, including his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff whom the president said met with Putin for about three hours recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to stop fighting," Trump said of Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he believes Putin wants to seize the entirety of Ukraine, Trump said: "That was my question to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If he's going to go on... that would have caused me a big problem," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he wants to end it, and they want to end it fast. Both of them," he said, adding "Zelensky wants to end it too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said Sunday he believed Russia was preparing to "wage war" against a weakened NATO should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appeared to dismiss Zelensky's remarks, telling reporters he was "not even a little bit" concerned about the Ukrainian leader's messaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn't even sure who Moscow was sending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front on Sunday against their common enemies, threatening to "open the gates of hell" on Hamas and "finish the job" against Iran.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pledges came during a joint address to reporters in Jerusalem, where Rubio began his first Middle East trip as Secretary of State in President Donald Trump's new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas cannot continue as a military or a government force... they must be eliminated," Rubio said of the Palestinian Islamist group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comment came a day after Hamas freed three Israeli hostages in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners, the sixth such swap under the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of ceasefire violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding to strain on the deal, Trump has made a widely-condemned proposal to take control of Gaza and relocate its more than two million residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking Rubio for "unequivocal backing" for Israel's policy in Gaza, Netanyahu added that Israel and the United States are determined to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions and its "aggression" in the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agreed that the ayatollahs must not have nuclear weapons and also agreed that Iran's aggression in the region must be rolled back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli-Iranian enmity stretches back decades through a history of clandestine wars and attacks by land, sea, air and cyberspace.
  <br>

    18-year-old Fonseca captures Argentina Open crown

<img alt="Brazil's Joao Fonseca celebrates with the trophy after winning the ATP 250 Argentina Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791911_1_20250217070810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca became the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history when he swept past home hope Francisco Cerundolo in the final of the Argentina Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old, ranked 99 in the world and playing in his first tour-level final, came through 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) against his 28th-ranked opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca twice unsuccessfully served for the match but regrouped to claim victory in the tie-break in a frenzied atmosphere in Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 ATP NextGen champion is the youngest male player from South America to win a tour title while his victory will also see him rise to 68 when the new rankings are released on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable week, even in Argentina there are some Brazilians cheering for me," Fonseca said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's just amazing. Every Brazilian, everyone from their country wants this support from your own country. For me, this moment that I'm living is just unbelievable," he added. "Of course I want to be number one, of course I want to win Slams, titles, but my dream is just to play tennis, and I'm living it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, seeking his fourth career title, was broken in the seventh game of the first set and fought off Fonseca when the teenager served for the trophy at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Brazilian impressively held his nerve in the tie-break and celebrated his triumph by collapsing in joy on the dusty, clay surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca made his maiden final the hard way – in Friday's quarter-finals he saved two match points to defeat Mariano Navone in a match six minutes shy of three hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, he defeated four Argentinian players on the road to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had already announced himself on the scene in January when he came through qualifying at the Australian Open and defeated top 10 player Andrey Rublev in the first round. (AFP)

 Health authorities said on Monday that thanks to a cross-border organ donation, an eight-month-old girl underwent a successful heart transplant on Sunday night.

  In a statement, Secretary for Health, Lo Chung-mau, noted that it was the second such case of cross-boundary organ donation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a then four-month-old baby girl, Tsz-hei, successfully received a heart donation from the mainland in December 2022 to extend her life, Hong Kong and the mainland established a close communication channel and procedures for cross-boundary organ transplant co-operation based on that successful experience," said Professor Lo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more than 100 personnel from 18 mainland authorities worked together and raced against time to ensure the safe and smooth transportation of the organ across multiple locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau and the Hospital Authority said the heart transplant was successfully completed for baby, Whitney, at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant in-charge of the Cardiothoracic Surgery of HKCH, Dr Nicholson Yam - who was in charge of the transplant - said the operation lasted approximately 6.5 hours. The statement said Whitney was now under close monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit and the following 24 hours would be a critical period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whitney's parents expressed their gratitude to the medical teams and to the different regional authorities in finding a suitable heart, as well as thanking the donor's family for their difficult and selfless decision, giving Whitney the chance for a new life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director of Cluster Services of the HA, Dr Simon Tang, said all efforts had been made through different networks to identify a suitable heart for Whitney amid the difficulties involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since there was no suitable recipient in the mainland, the mainland decided to send the donor heart to Hong Kong for transplanting to Whitney upon confirmation by experts from the two places that the heart was suitable for Whitney's transplantation," Dr Tang added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Luis Díaz ended his goal drought to spark a tense 2-1 win against struggling Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side got back on track after an unexpectedly poor week thanks to Díaz's first goal in 2025 and yet another Mohamed Salah strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz opened the scoring early in the first half at Anfield as the Colombian forward finally scored for the 13th time this term after 10 games without a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Díaz has struggled to find the net, Salah is in red-hot form and his penalty before the interval took the Egypt star to 28 goals in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha netted in the second half for fourth-bottom Wolves, but although Liverpool looked tired in a disjointed, nervous, climax, they held on for a valuable victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had gone two games without a win – an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round loss at second tier Plymouth last weekend and the stormy 2-2 draw at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester on Saturday had applied a little more pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds responded to Arsenal's challenge as they moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, who last won the Premier League in 2020, will be within touching distance of the crown if they take maximum points from trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle over the course of the next 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool boss Slot was in the dug-out despite being charged with abusive behaviour after angrily approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the Merseyside derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was furious that James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser was not disallowed because of a possible push by Toffees striker Beto on Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had urged Liverpool to use their "anger" from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  They didn't have to wait long to light the fuse as Díaz bagged his first league goal at Anfield since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham won the battle of the Premier League's underachievers 1-0 to inflict another dismal result on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored the only goal on 13 minutes as Spurs moved above United in the table into 12th thanks to a third win over the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory eased the pressure on under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou after exiting both domestic cup competitions this month to go with their lowly league position.
  <br>
  <br>
  United now find themselves down in 15th, but do enjoy a 12-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me," said Amorim, who has won just four of 14 Premier League games since taking charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about," he added. "I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's first home league win since November came amid a spirit of revolt among their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off and after the match Spurs fans again vented their frustration towards owners ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner read "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy – time for change" as a sizeable contingent of the home crowd joined a protest calling for Levy to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the mood for Postecoglou was lifted even before kick-off as he was able to welcome back a host of first-team regulars who have been sidelined by injury. (AFP)

 Over 50,000 civil servants and members of the public took part in a stress test at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aim was to assess the park's readiness ahead of its official opening at the beginning of next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exercise also looked into the performance of the Easy Leave platform. It uses artificial intelligence to analyse real-time data on crowd density and the time needed for people to follow an exit route.

    Doctors tell Pope Francis to preserve strength

<img alt="Pope Francis was admitted on Friday to Rome's Gemelli hospital with bronchitis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791876_1_20250216200957.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis sat out mass and his traditional Angelus prayer from hospital on Sunday, with a Vatican health official saying the 88-year-old pontiff needed to preserve his strength for the Church's busy Jubilee year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis was admitted on Friday to Rome's Gemelli hospital with bronchitis, one of several bouts of flu or bronchitis he has caught in recent winters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said Saturday that doctors prescribed "absolute rest", although they said tests had indicated some improvements in his condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to attend Sunday mass at St Peter's Basilica, the pope sent a written address to a group of artists and other cultural figures in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would have liked to be among you but, as you know, I am here at the Gemelli Hospital because I still need some treatment for my bronchitis," Francis wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the mass -- which is usually presided over by the pope -- Cardinal Jose Tolentino de Mendonca read Francis's homily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We live in a time when new walls are being erected, when differences become a pretext for division rather than an opportunity for mutual enrichment," the cardinal read. "But you, men and women of the world of culture, are called to build bridges."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the health office for the Italian Bishops' Conference, Massimo Angelelli, told AFPTV it was "absolutely necessary for him to recover his strength" as "the Jubilee is still long."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catholic Church has designated 2025 a "Jubilee Year" that is expected to draw more than 30 million visitors to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Occurring every 25 years, the Jubilee is intended as a period of reflection and penance, and marked by a long list of cultural and religious events -- many of them presided over by the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his health issues -- which include knee pain and his reliance on a wheelchair -- the pope keeps a very busy schedule and has said he has no current plans to slow down.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the days ahead of his hospitalisation, Francis -- who had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man -- several times asked aides to read his public speeches aloud on his behalf.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the Vatican said in a statement that tests had confirmed the pope was suffering from a "respiratory tract infection" but was not exhibiting signs of fever, and showed "improvement in some values". (AFP)

    Make good use of Hetao to boost biotech sector: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Sunday said Hong Kong should make good use of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to boost the country’s biotech development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion is among dozens of others the party is planning to propose during the annual sessions of the nation's legislature and top political advisory body in Beijing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong’s sole member of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said for one, authorities should allow blood samples taken from the mainland to be processed in Hetao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that [Hong Kong] Red Cross receive blood donation from the general public because we cannot have the samples from [mainland] China. We [also] have to export the blood samples to overseas countries to manufacture blood-related products for medical use,” she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our suggestion is to make use of Hetao for a trial so that all these samples can move to Hong Kong for further development and innovation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her party hopes to see more cross-border exchanges in areas like medicine and healthcare equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the party quoted some private enterprises as saying they would like more support from the central government to help them ride out the economic downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, you know, all the enterprises who are operating on the mainland have to pay the social security payment. And because of the tight economic environment, some say some sort of flexibility should be incorporated during this special period,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also said drivers under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme should be allowed to return to the SAR via more borders besides the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Mauritius arrested the island's former prime minister Pravind Jugnauth in a money-laundering probe and seized stacks of cash from a business linked to him, they said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the 63-year-old along with his wife Kobita Jugnauth in the early hours of Sunday and questioned him for several hours, police sources who asked not to be named told AFP. Kobita Jugnauth was later released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pravind Jugnauth was due to appear before a judge later in the morning, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police incident report seen by AFP detailed a search by officers at the home of another suspect, in which documents were found bearing the names of the Jugnauths, as well as luxury watches and stacks of various currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The island's Financial Crimes Commission had asked police to detain the Jugnauths and two other suspects if they tried to leave the country, in a notice issued on Saturday, citing investigations into "a case of money-laundering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime minister from 2017 to 2024, Pravind Jugnauth is a member of one of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius since it became independent from Britain in 1968.
  <br>
  <br>
  He oversaw a historic deal with Britain for Mauritius to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his Militant Socialist Movement suffered a crushing defeat in tense elections in November. He ceded office to centre-left rival Navin Ramgoolam, who became prime minister for the third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the campaign, both camps promised to improve the lives of ordinary Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Chagos deal, Britain will retain a lease for a joint US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Mauritius and Britain have said US President Donald Trump's administration will have a say on the final terms of the agreement. (AFP)

    Americans and Canadians in ice hockey punch fest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded line-ups of the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing into US borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came three fights in nine seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," USA coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred – I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not pre-arranged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' - none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight in the mayhem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top NHL players from the USA and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the USA went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period. (AFP)

 Customs officers have arrested a 28-year-old woman on suspicion of carrying the space oil drug in a vape stick.
 <br>
  <br>
  The woman was taken into custody at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Sheung Wan after she arrived from Macau on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestee, who claimed to be unemployed, has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the department’s first arrest since etomidate - a key ingredient of space oil drug - was included in the Dangerous Drug Ordinance last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trafficking or illegal import of such a substance is punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that issuing government bonds to fund the mega Northern Metropolis project is one way to ensure its development won’t be affected by Hong Kong’s economic situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said bonds are commonly used around the world to finance infrastructure projects, adding that international investors have traditionally been very receptive to the SAR’s debt securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  These investors, the minister said, include central banks, sovereignty funds, global organisations and banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has the conditions and ability to issue more bonds, and use market forces flexibly for implementing strategic infrastructure [projects]," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief cited research from international groups and local universities as saying that the SAR's debt level remains comparatively low, and bond issuance would be a smart solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan went on to say that in some developed economies, government debt is actually higher than its total GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said as Hong Kong's debt is just over nine percent of its total GDP, there is room to lift this percentage.

    Govt mulls longer grace period for basic housing units

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government is considering extending a grace period for landlords to convert subdivided flats, after new laws are introduced to regulate the compact homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had initially proposed a transitional period of up to two years for the registration of such flats, known as "basic housing units", which will need to meet a number of requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing public views received during a consultation exercise which concluded earlier, Ho said some respondents expressed the need for more time to make the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said extending the grace period to three years could be an option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Time-wise, it is helpful to the market - so tenants can move out and renovation work can take place and people have better options on where to live," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will help the situation. So I think a three-year grace period is something that can be considered."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the government is analysing the public’s views and will make adjustments to the legal proposals accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the housing chief said officials will soon put in place a pilot scheme at two public housing estates by installing sensors at the doors of flats occupied by elderly residents, in order to better ensure their safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme comes after a recent spate of cases involving elderly people who died alone in their homes for some time before being discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said dozens of households at Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin and Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong have signed up for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sensor records movements. The elderly person can decide who to send such information - it's not to the estate's management, it can be his or her son, daughter or other family members. It's up to the tenant," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the sensors don't have cameras and won't detect what's inside the flat.

    Crowds flock to Ocean Park to meet panda cubs

<img alt="Hundreds of people waited in line to meet the panda twins. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791839_2_20250216115418.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park's panda twin cubs made their highly-anticipated public debut on Sunday in front of hundreds of delighted locals and tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many visitors arrived extra early to make sure they could meet the baby pandas as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local panda enthusiast, surnamed Chan, told RTHK that he arrived at Ocean Park two hours before it opened - and he's also taking part in a contest to pick a name for the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I arrived here at 8am. I want to see them as soon as I can. I will join the [naming] contest, but I am still thinking [about what names to propose]. The theme will probably be related to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists were equally thrilled to meet the locally-born cubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Indonesian student who’s currently studying in Shenzhen said he doesn’t get to see pandas in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We don’t really have access to pandas [in Indonesia]. So looking at pandas, especially the cubs, is quite special to us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park says visitors are allowed to stay for up to five minutes inside the venue to give more people a chance to view the panda babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some said they wish they could spend more time with the cubs, Christa from San Francisco said the arrangement is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They [panda cubs] are just doing their own thing, just hanging out. They don’t need to do anything special, they’re just special the way they are,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think if you can take what you can get so others could enjoy them too I think it’s better to have more people enjoy them and want to conserve and protect them. So I think it’s better to have more people see them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewings of the panda cubs are from 10am to 3pm daily, and the facility is expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman sunamed Ho said she may sign up for the session so that she can spend more time with the twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the pandas climbing up and down. I like both of them. I think seeing the cubs grow up is like seeing my grandchildren. I am interested in the HK$1,500 session, at least I'll have half an hour to see the cubs. I think it's worth it because I feel happy after seeing them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another woman surnamed Leung said the VIP slot is just too costly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not consider [registering] at all. It is not necessary. I still have to see the pandas with another 50 people even after paying HK$1,500," she said.

<img alt='British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says London "will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791827_1_20250216082626.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders on Saturday mobilised to force their way to the table at any talks on the Ukraine war, as Washington announced a team of senior US officials was planning to meet in Saudi Arabia with counterparts from Moscow and Kiev.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump upended the status quo this week when he announced he was likely to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin soon to start talks to end the conflict, leaving US allies in Europe reeling from concerns that their interests would be sidelined in any deal on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head to Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, US officials said on Saturday, without giving details on when the meeting would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had already been due to visit Saudi Arabia as part his first tour of the Middle East, which began on Saturday when he arrived in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top US diplomat also had a call on Saturday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, in which he "reaffirmed President Trump's commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine," spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Munich, Nato chief Mark Rutte said Europe had to come up with "good proposals" for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant," Rutte told journalists at a gathering of top policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rutte also said he would head to Paris on Monday to take part in a meeting of European leaders convened by French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gathering would focus on defence spending and planning so that "when a deal is reached in Ukraine, that we have absolute clarity what Europe can contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Europe "must take on a greater role in Nato" and work with the United States to "secure Ukraine's future".
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Starmer said: "This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russi
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of any eventual "security guarantees" for Ukraine, talks have begun in Europe over a potential deployment of peacekeepers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those discussions are at an embryonic stage -- and others argue the focus needs to be on building up Ukraine's own forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created."
  <br>
  <br>
  The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelensky's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement," Zelensky said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, gave Europeans reasons to doubt they would be heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe would not be directly involved in talks but would still have an "input", Kellogg said in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have sought to assure Ukraine that it will not be left in the cold after three years of battling Russia's invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said after his sit-down with Zelensky that the United States was looking for a "durable, lasting peace" that would not lead to further bloodshed in coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has sent mixed messages to Kyiv, with Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth appearing to rule out Ukraine joining Nato or having all of its territoroy restoreD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also pushed for access to Ukraine's stocks of rare earth minerals as compensation for the military aid provided by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said ON Saturday he blocked a deal that would have given the US access to vast amounts of Ukrainian natural resources as it lacked "security guarantees" for Kyiv. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 14-year-old boy died, and five other people were injured in a knife attack in southern Austria on Saturday, police said, adding they have arrested a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A man randomly attacked passersby with a knife," police spokesman Rainer Dionisio told AFP of the incident in the city of Villach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One victim, a 14-year-old boy, died," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other men suffered serious injuries, while another two men were lightly injured, Dionisio added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Saturday just before 4pm local time (2300 HKT) in the centre of the city, the capital of Carinthia Province.
  <br>
  <br>
  A food delivery rider saw the attack and rammed his vehicle into the attacker, who was lightly injured and was arrested "right after the attack," according to Dionisio.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man under arrest is a Syrian asylum seeker with a valid residence permit and without a criminal record, according to preliminary information, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was the 14-year-old, while the oldest is 32 years old, he said. (AFP)

 US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a US lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who met with US Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy "to finally bring peace and end this conflict."
  <br>
  <br>
  A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the planned talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskiy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. They agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Putin and Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelenskiy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with US or Russian officials during those visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for US funding for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Ukraine are currently negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to US investment. Three sources said the US proposed taking ownership of 50 percent of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.

<img alt="A textbook header from Mikel Merino set the Gunners on their way. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791802_1_20250215223425.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal brushed off their shortage of specialist strikers on Saturday as midfielder Mikel Merino scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Leicester City that kept the north London club's Premier League title challenge on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merino's brace allowed second-placed Arsenal to cut Liverpool's advantage to four points although the leaders will be confident of replying against Wolverhampton Wanderers ,later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champions Manchester City's title hopes may have long since vanished but they looked much more recognisable as recent signing Omar Marmoush bagged a hat-trick in 13 first-half minutes in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win allowed City to climb into fourth place with 44 points, three points behind Nottingham Forest whose top-four ambitions suffered a dent in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth's challenge for the top four shows no sign of petering out as they won 3-1 at bottom club Southampton to move above Chelsea and Newcastle into fifth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  When German forward Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season this week, joining Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Sako on the injured list, Arsenal fans must have feared the worst.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta gave Raheem Sterling a place in his starting line-up at Leicester but the former Chelsea man had a torrid afternoon and was replaced by Merino after 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard's impact was decisive as he broke the deadlock in the 81st minute from an assist by impressive teenager Ethan Nwaneri and he wrapped up the points in the 87th minute after good work by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the game started to suit (Merino) more because they started to defend much deeper, and we had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. "We believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Arsenal stayed on Liverpool's heels, Leicester's plight is precarious. They are 19th with 17 points after losing nine of their last 10 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Marmoush had not scored for City since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt last month but he opened his account in explosive fashion against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Marmoush gave City the lead in the 19th minute with a lob after Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier misjudged goalkeeper Ederson's long delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five minutes later he latched on to a pass from Ilkay Gundogan to fire home and then completed his hat-trick with a thumping shot after good work by Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew sooner or later he would score goals, he is a good finisher. Of course he has to improve, but now we see how he handles the compliments," manager Pep Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only blemish for City was Erling Haaland being forced off with an injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have not spoken to the doctor, but I was scared when he went down. Maybe it's not as bad as it could be," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood scored his 18th league goal of the season for Forest but it could not prevent his side slipping to defeat at Fulham for whom Emile Smith Rowe opened the scoring and Calvin Bassey headed the winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth moved to fifth with 43 points, just one behind Manchester City, as goals by Dango Ouattara, Ryan Christie and Marcus Tavernier sealed the points in the south coast derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation battlers Ipswich Town secured a well-earned point in a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Axel Tuanzebe was dismissed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich still went ahead after the break when Liam Delap steered in Omari Hutchinson's low cross but Ollie Watkins equalised for Villa who dropped to ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich are in 18th place with 17 points, two behind 17th placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleventh-placed Brentford beat West Ham United 1-0 away thanks to an early goal by Kevin Schade. They have now won three successive away games in the top flight for the first time ever. (Reuters)

<img alt="Craig and Lindsay Foreman are being held on unspecified security charges. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791801_1_20250215220928.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government on Saturday named two Britons detained in Iran as Craig and Lindsay Foreman, with their family saying they are determined to ensure the pair's "safe return."
 <br>
  <br>
  The two are currently being held in the city of Kerman, the family said in a statement issued by the British foreign ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family added that it was "united in our determination to secure their safe return."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal," said the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple are in their early 50s and were on a motorbike tour around the world when they were detained in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Friday that it was "providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran" and was in contact with Iranian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Thursday that two British nationals were being held in central Kerman province for unspecified security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government advises against all travel to Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are "at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention."
  <br>
  <br>
  Several other Europeans are held in custody in Iran, which has conducted multiple prisoner exchanges with Western governments in recent years. (AFP)

    Scholz rejects 'outsiders intervening' in dig at Vance

<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pushed back against US Vice President JD Vance's broadside against Germany and the EU on Friday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791795_1_20250215201949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday said that Germany rejects "outsiders intervening in our democracy," a day after US Vice President JD Vance in a blistering speech told Europe to open the door to far-right parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz, who faces elections on February 23, spoke in Munich where Vance on Friday launched his broadside against Germany and the EU on immigration, free speech and other topics in a speech later praised by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance also met Alice Weidel, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also received strong backing from technology billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Scholz pushed back against Vance's speech and defended Germany's taboo against cooperating with extremist parties, often dubbed a "firewall."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections," Scholz said. "That is not appropriate – especially not among friends and allies."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also defended European policies after Vance's speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Europe," Barrot said on X, after Vance alleged it was "in retreat." "Nobody is obliged to adopt our model, but nobody can impose theirs on us," the French minister added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz started his speech by mentioning Vance's earlier visit to the Nazis' Dachau concentration camp near Munich, and the US vice president's commitment to "never again" allow such crimes to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Holocaust was the reason "the vast majority of Germans are firmly opposed to those who glorify or justify" the Nazis, Scholz said, recalling that AfD senior figures have trivialised Nazi crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A commitment to 'never again' cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later stressed that "we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should stay outside the political decision-making process and that there would be no cooperation with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance had criticised Germany for excluding parties that voice strong concerns over immigration and argued that "democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no room for firewalls," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash between the traditional allies comes just over a week before German national elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats are currently third in the polls at around 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is being led by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, whose support stands at around 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD is expected to score its best-ever national result, now polling in second place at around 20 percent. (AFP)

    Zelensky calls for creation of European army

<img alt="Ukraine's president tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe needs its own army. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791790_1_20250215191907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deal reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement – an implicit message to US President Donald Trump as he strives to end the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech to the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky also called on Europe to create its own armed forces, urging the continent's leaders to decide their own future and saying Ukraine's armed forces alone were not enough for their security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky spoke after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, the first between US and Russian leaders since Russia's February 2022 full-scale assault on Ukraine, and said he and Putin expected to meet in the future, probably in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration so far has left the impression among some European allies that it was making concessions to Putin at Ukraine's expense before any negotiations begin, though remarks by some top US officials have raised confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky predicted that the Kremlin would try to persuade Trump to attend Russia's May 9 commemorations in Moscow, when it marks the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade through Red Square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky told the conference that he believed it would be "dangerous" if Trump met Putin before he and Trump meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  To Europe's leaders, he issued warnings, asking rhetorically whether their armies would be ready if Moscow launched an open or "false-flag" attack. The latter is designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone other than the group responsible for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this (Ukraine-Russia) war ends the wrong way, he (Putin) will have a surplus of battle-tested soldiers who know nothing but killing and looting," he said, citing intelligence reports saying Russia will dispatch its troops to Belarus this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe." (Reuters)

    Tennis world number one Sinner gets 3-month doping ban

<img alt="Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner says he accepts responsibility for his team's mistakes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791789_1_20250215183106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis after the world number one admitted team mistakes led to him twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The February 9 to May 4 suspension means Sinner will be free to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sinner said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accepted that he "had no intent and did not derive any competitive advantage from the two positive tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Open champion Sinner has always said that clostebol entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis, I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wada said separately that "Sinner did not intend to cheat" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement between Sinner and Wada means that Sinner will be able to play in front of his home fans at the Rome Open which kicks off just after the end of his suspension and is the last big clay court tournament before Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

 The EU said on Saturday it was "urgently" considering all options in response to a widening rebel offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, after Rwandan-backed forces seized a second major city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having captured the key provincial capital of Goma last month, M23 fighters pushed south and took a vital airport before marching virtually unchecked into another key city, Bukavu, on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Alarmed by news of Rwandan backed M23 forces seizing Kavumu airport and entering Bukavu, ignoring international appeals for ceasefire," European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU urgently considers all the means at its disposal. The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning comes as the conflict is set to dominate an African Union summit that opened on Saturday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying a regional escalation "must be avoided at all costs".
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows an appeal from the European Parliament, which this week urged the EU to suspend a minerals deal with Rwanda in response to Kigali's involvement in the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers in Strasbourg on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution which also called for the bloc's 27 member states to freeze all direct budget support as well as military and security assistance to Rwanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rwanda denies giving military support to the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in DR Congo of threatening its security.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by UN experts said last year Kigali maintained around 4,000 troops in DR Congo and had de facto control of the rebel group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. (AFP)

    Real-name ticketing deters scalpers: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on the government to implement real-name registration for tickets to prevent scalping.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV program on Saturday, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said real-name ticketing can deter scalpers and allow people who are truly interested in attending to buy tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When more mega events are taking place, there will be more ticket scalping. Recently, it was reported in the news that a ticket had been marked-up to an astronomical price of more than HK$100,000,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the market can be regulated and stabilized. We believe that real-name ticketing is a good way to achieve that,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council received over 40,000 complaints last year, a 20 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said over 7,000 complaints were related to Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match last February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  She urged organisers to provide clearer clauses for future events, and to inform consumers earlier if they are any changes.

    Govt working with privacy watchdog on data interchange

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A data interchange system among departments has not been set up due to privacy and technical issues, according Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, but the government is in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to overcome challenges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers had called on the authorities to provide more assistance to hidden elders, after a 78-year-old man was found dead inside his Tuen Mun flat earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event on Saturday, Sun said the government should make use of data from departments like the Hospital Authority and the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities are currently in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to discuss ways allowing data interchange, while complying with the Personal Data Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can intervene before any incident occurs. We can identify some high-risk cases and contact them to provide services. We hope to avoid tragedies as much as possible," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive's Policy Address last year mentioned that officials would make use of identification tools designed by universities for detection of high-risk cases.

    3 Israeli hostages released, 369 Palestinians freed

<img alt="Red Cross vehicles wait at the spot where Hamas handed over Israeli hostages in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791774_1_20250215165327.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli hostages Iair Horn, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha (Alexander) Troufanov arrived at a release site in Gaza on Saturday after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters led the three onto a stage at the site in Gaza's Khan Younis, live footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three have been returned in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a swap which eases fears that the agreement could collapse before the end of a 42-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas had earlier threatened not to release more hostages after it accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by blocking aid from entering Gaza, drawing counter-threats of a resumption of fighting from Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emaciated appearance of three hostages released last week and accounts of abuse by other hostages released since January 19 when the ceasefire took effect has set off Israeli protests demanding that the government stick to the ceasefire and proceed with the next stage of the deal to bring all the hostages home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prospects for the ceasefire surviving have also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved permanently out of Gaza, and for the enclave to be turned over to the United States to be redeveloped. That call was strongly rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce was intended to open the way for a second phase of negotiations to return remaining hostages and complete the withdrawal of Israeli forces before a final end to the war and the rebuilding of Gaza, which now lies largely in ruins, facing shortages of food, running water and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas threat to hold off from releasing more hostages followed its accusation that Israel had blocked tents and temporary shelter materials from entering into Gaza, leaving tens of thousands exposed to the winter cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel rejected the accusation, saying it had allowed thousands of aid trucks in. Hamas on Saturday said it expects Israel to meet its aid obligations for the ceasefire to stay on track. (Reuters)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<img alt="OpenAI's board said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to purchase the company. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791762_1_20250215151723.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

    CE invites public to name panda twins

<div class="itemFullText">
 People are invited to suggest names for Ocean Park's panda twin cubs as they turn six months old on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the greeting ceremony for the panda babies, Chief Executive John Lee said people can submit their ideas, based on the twins' appearance and personality, from noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will announce their names in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Sunday will be a big day, as the cubs will finally meet the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that pandas have been born in the SAR, and there's a sense of elation among Hong Kong people. The pair only weighed about 120 grammes each when they were born, and they've shown extraordinary resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After six months, their weight has increased to over ten kilogrammes each. They were a bit shaky at first, but now, they've become experts at tree climbing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park said people can suggest a Chinese name for each of the cubs, along with an explainer of the meaning of the Chinese names.
  <br>
  <br>
  The submission deadline is March 7, and the judging panel will comprise representatives from the park, the SAR government, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park's chairman Paulo Pong said with the support of the whole community, the SAR has successfully promoted the concept of "panda is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With promotions through social media, on transportation and various creative activities across Hong Kong involving panda-themed products, we connected Hong Kong and global panda lovers. This further promotes Hong Kong's tourism and culture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the park will use top-tier animal care, veterinary and scientific research to help with the breeding of giant pandas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said efforts to educate the elderly have led to a significant drop in the number of so-called “Guess Who” phone scams – in which fraudsters pose as an old friend or relative of the victim.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of “Guess Who” phone scams, which mainly targets victims aged 65 or above, were down by 48 percent last year, police commissioner Raymond Siu said on Saturday after attending a Commercial Radio program.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s why last year, we particularly focused our effort to deliver these anti-scam messages to the elderly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said police are working with The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) to combat other types of telephone scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes following reports of suspected scam text messages carrying the hashtag prefix, to trick victims into thinking that they were sent by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, the authority launched a short message service (SMS) sender registration scheme, in which companies and organizations participating send text messages under their registered IDs with the prefix “#”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to tackle other telephone scams, we need to find out the reasons as well as the victimised group, so as to work with all stakeholders, in particular the telecommunications industry and also the OFCA,” Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We set up a specific working group back in September 2022. We continue to hold regular meetings with them, in order to come up with different measures to tackle this sort of telephone scam,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu reminded residents to remain alert to potential scam messages, especially those with hyperlinks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand said they arrested 10 Chinese nationals in connection with the case involving Chinese actor Wang Xing and have handed them over to the immigration department for repatriation to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement released by the Thai police, investigations found that the 10 arrested belonged to a criminal gang that had long been conducting telecommunications fraud targeting Chinese citizens in Myawaddy, Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were accused of pretending to be employees of an entertainment company in Thailand to defraud Wang Xing. After Wang's rescue, they attempted to flee to Cambodia via Thailand, but were arrested in various locations near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thatchai Pitaneelaboot, senior inspector general of the Thai police, said he's instructed for the 10 suspects to be handed over to the Thai Immigration Bureau for repatriation to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Xing, a Chinese actor, entered Thailand on January 3 but lost contact near the Thailand-Myanmar border. Thai police tracked his movements and successfully carried out a rescue operation, identifying Wang as a victim of human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand said Wang has since returned to China following joint efforts from both countries. (Xinhua)

 The construction industry should look into limiting the use of bamboo scaffolding if the situation calls for it, according to Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a Kai Tak construction site last month injured 11 workers, sparking discussions about replacing bamboo altogether with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Siu said the industry should explore the possibility to limit the use of bamboo and find the most suitable material for each construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bamboo is very special material and it's widely used in Hong Kong, but in other places, they don't use bamboo. That means there may be some shortcomings of this material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we need to do more research on why some Hong Kong construction companies like to use metal material instead of bamboo."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, Chau Sze-kit, told the same programme that it is impossible to completely scrap the use of bamboo scaffold immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the industry should instead look into ways of implementing safety mechanisms when using either bamboo or metal scaffold.
