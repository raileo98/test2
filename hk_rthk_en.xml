<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 33-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

 Runners and organisers of the Hong Kong Oxfam Trailwalker on Friday braced for a rainy start and a mischievous troop of monkeys.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video showed that dozens of monkeys were raiding a supply station set up along the route, ransacking for food and delving into a torn blue-and-white striped nylon bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, Oxfam Hong Kong’s director of fundraising and communications, said it is hard to prevent the animals from enjoying what he called a "once-a-year, all-you-can-eat buffet" at the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said volunteers could only replenish food and supplies at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oxfam Trailwalker is one of the city's largest fundraising events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Participants are given 48 hours to complete the 100-kilometre run, kicking off at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and finishing at Harrow International School Hong Kong in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also a shorter 40-kilometre race.

    'Some fan heaters not energy efficient'

<img alt="Gilly Wong, left, says the devices tested by the Consumer Council have different airflow rates and energy-efficiency levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council said on Friday bladeless fans with heating functions may not be as energy efficient as some other products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found 11 models it tested took longer to heat up the room than traditional fan heaters it tested previously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The models were also found to have different airflow rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average is 16.1 cubic metres per minute, three of them had an airflow rate of 10 cubic metres or less per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are talking about the airflow rate for different bladeless fans, we found it quite diverse. The energy efficiency, as well, is also quite diverse. Don't assume the fact that this kind of fans are very similar in terms of energy consumption. In actual fact, there are more energy-saving ones for you to select," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more you use energy-efficient appliances, the more you save for your expenses, but furthermore, you help to save the environment as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said by contrast, reverse-cycle air conditioners, which offers both heating and cooling in one system, may be more energy efficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said it's ultimately up to consumers to choose what they want to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are pros and cons. If you are talking about the reverse-cycle air conditioner, its heating capacity is much better and energy efficiency is much better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when you are talking about the installation, the cost by itself obviously is higher, and also the mobility of it is not there because it's fixed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department could consider including different types of electric fans in the Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, so consumers can compare products.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities on Friday kicked off their first cybersecurity drill in a bid to enhance their defence capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event involves a number of government departments and public bodies handling cyberattacks carried out by some members of the IT industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innovation and technology minister Sun Dong said cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the digital economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maintaining online security is an important part of promoting high-quality economic development and building smart cities. This long-term task is always ongoing, and never finished," Sun said in a speech marking the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sincerely hope that participating teams, as well as observing departments and organisations, will seize this opportunity to test yourself and improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that eight mainland cybersecurity firms with experience with such drills offered technical support and suggestions for this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drill was organised by the Digital Policy Office and co-hosted by various departments, such as the police cybersecurity and tech crimes unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not reveal which government systems are involved in the drill.

    Scent boosters 'unnecessary add-ons for laundry'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to cross the border at two checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It applies to mainland residents who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<img alt="The consumer watchdog says nearly 70 percent of the 45 attempts to use people's own containers for to-go orders were successful.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    England triumph without star absences to sink Greece

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

    Sinner beats Medvedev for perfect ATP Finals group run

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

    Powell lauds US economy as 'remarkably good'

<img alt="US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says inflation is falling, the labour market is solid and growth is resilient. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779227_1_20241115061843.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The recent performance of the US economy has been "the best of any major economy in the world," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, a week after the bank cut interest rates for a second consecutive meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank recently started cutting back its key lending rates from a two-decade high, turning attention from tackling inflation to supporting the labor market as the rate of price increases has moderated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been widespread anger about the cumulative impact of years of inflation, which has pushed up consumer prices by more than 20 percent since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the economic facts today are clear, Powell said during an event in Dallas, Texas, noting that inflation was falling toward the Fed's long-term two percent target, the labor market was "solid," and economic growth remained resilient.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell noted that inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was "running much closer" to the bank's target, but had not reached it just yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting," he said, referring to the level of interest rates over the long run that keep both inflation and unemployment in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the path for getting there is not preset," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures traders currently place a probability of close to 60 percent that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dampened investor hopes for another interest rate cut this year by saying the US central bank need not rush to ease monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Powell said at a Dallas Fed event that with the economy still growing, the job market solid and inflation still above the 2 percent target, the Fed can deliberate carefully on rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  While traders were still betting on a 25-basis point reduction at the Fed's December meeting, the probability sank to 55.5 percent from 76 percent earlier in the afternoon and from 82.5 percent on Wednesday, the CME Fed Watch tool showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The comments from Powell put more cold water on what used to be a very optimistic outlook on the path for rate cuts," said Adam Hetts, global head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we can't take for granted that inflation and labor are in balance so this is an encouraging message on the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell almost 0.47 percent, to 43,752. The S&P lost 0.61 percent, to end at 5,949, while the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 19,107.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday data showed the producer price index for final demand rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in October, in line with forecasts, though the annual rise of 2.4 percent was a touch higher than expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobless claims dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, lower than forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more evidence that inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2 percent target," said Melissa Brown, managing director for Investment Decision Research at SimCorp in New York. "The numbers were roughly in line with expectations but sometimes investors step back and say, 'What does this really mean?' It leads to more uncertainty about what the Fed does after the December meeting." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory cancelled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 1.20am on Friday as Typhoon Toraji weakened and the threat to Hong Kong receded. .
 <br>
  <br>
  However, the Observatory said it's still monitoring another tropical cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Usagi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Tropical Cyclone Usagi is currently forecast to cross the Luzon Strait on Friday morning and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it's expected to stay more than 500 kilometres from Hong Kong, posing little direct threat to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will then move northeastward toward the Ryukyu Islands and to gradually weaken.

    World's largest coral found near Solomon Islands

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing on Thursday a major discovery "pulsing with life and colour".
 <br>
  <br>
  The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they had stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and colour," marine ecologist Enric Sala said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The standalone structure had been growing for some 300 years, the researchers said, formed from a "complex network" of tiny coral polyps.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was distinct from a coral reef, which is made from many distinct coral colonies, they explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measuring 34 metres wide and 32 metres long, the team said the "mega coral" was three times bigger than the previous record holder – a coral dubbed "Big Momma" in American Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor," said lead scientist Molly Timmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was longer than a blue whale and was thought to be "so colossal" that it could "be seen from space".
  <br>
  <br>
  The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands in an area known as the Three Sisters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope," said coral scientist Eric Brown. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    India's toxic smog hides landmarks, delays flights

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toxic smog obscured India's famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, as well as Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, becoming too thick to see through in several places.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city of Lahore in neighbouring Pakistan ranked as the world's most polluted in winter's annual scourge across the region, worsened by dust, emissions, and smoke from fires burnt illegally in India's farming states of Punjab and Haryana.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the city of Agra, the Taj Mahal was barely visible from the gardens in front of the 17th-century monument, while dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab, television images showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi flights also faced delays, with tracking website Flightradar24 showing 88 percent of departures and 54 percent of arrivals were delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials blamed high pollution, combined with humidity, becalmed winds and a drop in temperature for the smog, which cut visibility to 300 metres at the city's international airport, which diverted flights in zero visibility on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More patients flocked to hospitals, particularly children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a sudden increase in children with allergies, cough and cold ... and a rise in acute asthma attacks," Sahab Ram, a paediatrician in Punjab's Fazilka region, told news agency ANI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 16.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday from 17 degrees Celsius the previous day, weather officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its pollution ranked in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day, with a score of 430 on an index of air quality maintained by the top pollution panel that rates a score of zero to 50 as 'good'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pollution in New Delhi is likely to stay in the 'severe' category on Friday, the earth sciences ministry said, before improving to 'very poor', or an index score of 300 to 400.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of farm fires to clear fields in northern India has risen steadily this week to almost 2,300 on Wednesday from 1,200 on Monday, the ministry's website showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, was rated the world's most polluted city on Thursday, in live rankings kept by Swiss group IQAir. Authorities there have also battled hazardous air this month. (Reuters)

    China's Zeekr to take control of sister brand Lynk

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Geely said on Thursday its premium electric vehicle maker Zeekr plans to take control of sister brand Lynk & Co - the first big restructuring move in a planned overhaul for the sprawling automotive group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid," Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Volvo Cars were up 3.5 percent in early trade, among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-listed shares of Zeekr dropped over 7 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeekr will then nudge its stake up to 51 percent with a capital injection while Geely Auto, the group's main listed arm, will continue to own the rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. It should be completed by June next year, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the T3 signal to a T1 at 10.20pm on Thursday as tropical depression Toraji continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10pm, Toraji was estimated to be about 150 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move west slowly across the seas south of the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it will drop all typhoon signals when Toraji no longer poses a threat to the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mastermind of a plot to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019 was on Thursday jailed for more than 23 years while six others were slapped with jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years each.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involving the "Dragon Slaying Brigade" was Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Chi-hung, whom the High Court heard was the mastermind in the case, was given the heaviest sentence of 23 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects and one count of possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chun-keung, described as the leader of the group, was sentenced to 13 years and six months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other defendants received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trial, the High Court heard the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019, one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Li, chief superintendent from the national security police department, told reporters after the ruling that the heavy sentences reflected the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statements and evidence [presented in court] showed that this group had the capability and was very active in trying to carry out the action," he said.

  "If the police hadn't dismantled this group and their plan in time, it's believed that many people would have been impacted, including those participating in protests or innocent bystanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling shows that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the defendants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment demonstrates that any person intending to plan and commit terrorist activities, endanger public security or disrupt society tranquillity can never escape sanctions of the law," it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the Department of Justice will study the reasons for sentencing and consider whether to appeal the sentences.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will face a manpower crunch of 180,000 workers by 2028, compared with the shortage of 50,000 that was recorded last year, according to the government's manpower projection released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shortfall in the service industry was the worst last year, as it saw a shortage of 24,000 staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the situation would change by 2028 as jobs requiring skilled technicians would see a significant shortage of talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the city needs to find at least 60,000 additional staff to fill the shortfall, a six-fold increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun revealed the government already has plans to import 30,000 skilled workers in phases over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to allow qualified technical professionals, who may not have a graduate degree, they may be educated below the bachelor level, to allow them into Hong Kong to fill the gap," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one criteria we have to uphold is these people - they must be young technical professionals. By young, we mean those aged at or under 35."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun revealed the bureau came up with the projection after holding more than 170 consultation sessions with different industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the rapid development of AI and automation, saying that the labour shortfall would be worse without the help of technology.

<img alt="George Tsoi (second left) expects 3,000 spectators to attend the rugby match at the 5,000-seat sports ground in Kai Tak. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779153_1_20241114172819.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    'Professionals need guidance on child abuse reports'
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A child welfare organisation on Thursday urged the government to offer professionals guidance before a mandatory reporting mechanism for suspected child abuse comes into effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Against Child Abuse (ACA) said it handled about 1,000 enquiries between April last year and March this year, of which 185 involved child abuse fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation said more than 15 percent of the enquiries were from professionals, such as teachers, social workers and doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACA director Donna Wong said she expects the number of cases reported by professionals to gradually increase, as awareness has improved since Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said sufficient preparatory work must be carried out before the legislation comes into effect in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that relevant support measures, such as the mandatory reporting guide, trainings for related professionals, the childcare residential placement, emergency placement and publicity education… will be well prepared in the 18-month transition period so that the mechanism will fully play its effectiveness,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, professionals who fail to report abuse cases risk a three-month jail term and a HK$50,000 fine.

    Philippines braces for more storms ahead

<img alt="Rescuers fetch residents during a forced evacuation operation in Buguey town, Cagayan province, north of Manila, ahead of Super Typhoon Usagi's landfall. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779129_1_20241114154252.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippines raised its highest storm alert and evacuated thousands of people on Thursday, as Super Typhoon Usagi barrelled towards its already disaster-ravaged north.
 <br>
  <br>
  Packing sustained winds of up to 185 kilometres an hour, Usagi is set to hit the main island of Luzon later on Thurday -- the fifth storm to threaten the country in just three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brutal wave of weather disturbances has already killed 159 people and prompted the United Nations to request US$32.9 million in aid for the worst-affected regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national weather agency said the winds could cause "almost total damage to structures of light materials, especially in highly exposed coastal areas", and "heavy damage" to buildings otherwise considered "low-risk".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense to torrential rain" and potentially "life-threatening" coastal waves of up to three metres were also forecast over two days, with the storm warning raised to the highest signal on a five-step scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cagayan province, where the storm is expected to make landfall, officials worked in driving rain to remove residents along the coasts and on the banks of already swollen rivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday it was preemptive evacuations. Now we're doing forced evacuations," local disaster official Edward Gaspar said, adding 1,404 residents were sheltering at a municipal gym.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more evacuees in nearby villages but we haven't had time to visit and count them," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cagayan's civil defence chief Rueli Rapsing said he expects local governments to take 40,000 people to shelters, roughly the same number that were preemptively evacuated ahead of Typhoon Yinxing, which struck Cagayan's north coast earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,000 Cagayan residents were still in shelters following the previous storms because the Cagayan River, the country's largest, remained swollen from heavy rain that fell in several provinces upstream.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Usagi, Tropical Storm Man-yi is also forecast to strike the Philippines' population heartland around the capital Manila this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Typhoons are overlapping. As soon as communities attempt to recover from the shock, the next tropical storm is already hitting them again," UN Philippines Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this context, the response capacity gets exhausted and budgets depleted."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people and keeping millions in enduring poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

    HK to sign free trade agreement with Peru: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has confirmed that a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will be signed this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee arrived in Lima on Wednesday evening local time, ahead of the Apec Economic Leaders’ meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook entry, the CE said he was greeted at the airport by Peruvian energy minister Romulo Mucho Mamani and Chinese Ambassador to Peru Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong began negotiating the pact with Peru in January 2023, with the agreement to cover goods and services, as well as investment and a dispute settlement mechanism. Talks concluded in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement with the existing eight covering 20 economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from securing the much-anticipated trade pact, the SAR leader will also attend bilateral meetings with other Apec leaders and meet local business representatives in Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth-largest trading partner in Latin America and 46th globally. Merchandise trade between the two places totalled HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong next Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed to seventh in a survey of economies ranking their global digital competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the city's highest ranking in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's according to the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking compiled by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute said Hong Kong had advanced three places following an improvement in three areas - technology, knowledge and future readiness.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that employee training in the city demonstrated a significant enhancement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said the result recognised Hong Kong's status as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with various sectors of society to further enhance Hong Kong's I&T ecosystem, thereby upholding our competitive edge in the global market and injecting new impetus to economic development," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore claimed top spot in the ranking, followed by Switzerland and Denmark.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several airlines resumed flights to Bali on Thursday, after cancelling trips to and from the Indonesian resort island due to huge eruptions at a nearby volcano.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eighty-three international routes were cancelled on Wednesday, the general manager of Bali's international airport said in a statement, after Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki spewed a nine-kilometre tower of ash into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano has erupted more than a dozen times over the last two weeks, killing at least nine people and forcing the evacuation of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qantas and Jetstar resumed their services to Bali, Australia's Qantas Group said in a statement on Thursday, noting "improved" conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to monitor the changing conditions and volcanic activity," it said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday morning, Bali's airport had recorded another 32 international flight cancellations while 180 international flights were scheduled, the airport's general manager Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that volcanic ash from Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki had been heading away from the airport since Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope affected airline passengers can resume their travel on Thursday," Ahmad said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewotobi erupted again overnight into Thursday morning, and a thick ash column and lava flows could be seen pouring from its crater, according to authorities. (AFP)

    Toraji not as bad as expected, say commuters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toraji left Hong Kong relatively unscathed, with commuters saying the storm was not as bad as they expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  At Admiralty Station many people were making their way to work as the observatory downgraded the T8 signal to T3 at 10.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotel worker Jana said getting to work wasn't a hassle, but she thinks the T3 announcement could have come earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not good. So everybody needs to be fast. We're going to work and [hurrying] to get ready... it's not good," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason, who was waiting for a taxi at Kowloon Tong Station, shared her sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s not really a big issue but there needs to be more transportation options to help people get to work immediately. I think transportation should resume to normality a little before the signal is lowered," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter, a barrister, said taxi drivers were jacking up fares during the storm so he had to take the MTR instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The taxis are playing the usual game. I live in Sheung Wan. I got into a cab, wanted to go to Bank of China Tower. Once I was in, he said, oh, that'll be 100 dollars. Well, it's a scam," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MTR is always operating, unless it's a direct hit when everything shuts down. I've lived in Hong Kong for so long, it's just part of the summer or late summer, isn't it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Maeva, who was getting breakfast before a job interview, said transport was smooth but many shops were still closed because of the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here to do some shopping but everything is closed, because of the storm. It's less [smooth] than usual but still. I think it was rainy and windy but not that bad," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists told RTHK that it didn't feel like a T8 at all and they were eager to explore the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not affected in anyway. I feel relatively safe. I am looking forward to travelling around here," said a US visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a tourist from Russia, Vladislav, said he had to start his activities for the day a little later than planned because most stores were closed in Kowloon Tong.

    T3 replaces T8 as storm moves away from HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the T3 signal in place of T8 at 10.20am on Thursday as Hong Kong gradually returns to normalcy with the departure of Tropical Storm Toraji.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 had been up for more than 11 hours, with the SAR largely unscathed as the storm skirted around 130km south of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the T3 would remain in force for most of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm led to the cancellation of 10 flights, with 20 others delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the airport would operate as normal for the day and should be able to handle more than 1,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other modes of public transport would also gradually get back to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation and bus companies said most services have gradually resumed to normal frequencies as T3 replaced T8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses to the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau would return to full operations from 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, ferry services between Discovery Bay and Central would also resume from 10.40am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Ferry said outlying island ferry services would resume from 11.30am, while Star Ferry said its cross-harbour services between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as well as Wan Chai would resume at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said public out-patient and specialist out-patient clinics as well as day services would gradually resume within two hours after T8 was replaced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said patients whose appointments were affected by the storm, and who made their bookings through the phone or the mobile app, HA Go, could make a new appointment from 11.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time during a T8, the stock market stayed open under a new arrangement introduced in September to keep trading going despite adverse weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourist spots would also reopen gradually. Hong Kong Disneyland said it would provide limited services from 11.30am, while Ocean Park would do the same from noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District would reopen at 1pm, and tickets to M+ and the Hong Kong Palace Museum were extended for 60 days.

 Trading in Hong Kong financial markets opened as usual on Thursday morning despite the T8 typhoon signal - the first time since authorities scrapped trading suspension under severe weather in September.

  <br>
  The Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing said securities and derivatives markets will remain fully operational.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index opened down 197 points, or 0.99 percent, at 19,626 on Thursday.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau is on a mission in Lima as he seeks cooperation and investment opportunities with other economies in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his first full day in the Peruvian capital, Yau held bilateral meetings with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts on the sidelines of the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He first met Thai commerce minister Pichai Naripthaphan. The pair exchanged pleasantries in basic Cantonese, before sitting down for a formal dialogue behind closed doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR commerce chief then held similar exchanges with Budi Santoso, the Indonesian minister of trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau briefed the Southeast Asian delegations about the latest development in Hong Kong, and explored potential cooperation opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed gratitude to both Thailand and Indonesia for their support regarding the SAR’s accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP.

    T8 to be downgraded at 10.20am as Toraji departs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) said it will downgrade the T8 storm signal to T3 at 10.20am – in time for students of afternoon primary and secondary schools to go back to class.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said winds are expected to weaken as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly moves away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Toraji is now closest to the territory,” the HKO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderat gradually during the day today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night. However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at a public hospital during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes will resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning were also adjourned, while afternoon hearings will be held as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies. It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.

 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it would consider downgrading the T8 storm signal between 10am and noon, as Tropical Storm Toraji starts slowly moving away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wind gusts in excess of 80 kilometres per hour were recorded at Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn as the storm inched its way past Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a 6am briefing, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung of the Observatory said Toraji was at that point the closest it would come to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderate gradually during the day today. Depending on the weakening of local winds, the Observatory will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 10am and 12 noon,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night.
  <br>

  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 signal is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning are also adjourned, and afternoon hearings will also be put off if the T8 warning is still up as of 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.

    US stocks finish mixed after inflation uptick

<img alt="The three major indices moved only slightly after new data pointed to a widely expected rise in inflation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779007_1_20241114053049.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks were little-changed on Wednesday, as traders digested fresh data pointing to a small and widely expected rise in inflation last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.1 percent to 43,958, while the S&P 500 rose by less than 0.1 percent to 5,985.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 19,230.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been some concern ahead of Wednesday's CPI report that it could be hotter than expected, said B Riley Wealth Management chief market strategist Art Hogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the end, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.6 percent in the 12 months to October, in line with economists' expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers in large part are the fact that the CPI came in very much in line with expectations, and some buzz in the markets yesterday," he said. "So that coming in line was very much a positive."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Samantha Harvey won the 2024 Booker Prize for her novel 'Orbital', a story about a single day aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Orbital" tracks astronauts from Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain and Italy as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the 49-year-old Harvey's fifth novel, and was the top selling book on the shortlist of six finalists, having sold more copies than the past three Booker Prize winners combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges of the prize, which is now in its 55th year, praised her writing for the "intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world".
  <br>
  <br>
  Past winners of the prestigious Booker, which is open to works of fiction written in English, include Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Yann Martel, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Kazuo Ishiguro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey said she wrote the novel while stuck at home during the pandemic watching the space station's live camera. She likened the experience of her six characters "trapped in a tin can" to that of lockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set over 24 hours, the astronauts and cosmonauts of her story witness sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets as they circle the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself," said Harvey. "What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the novel “is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her acceptance speech, Harvey dedicated the prize to "everybody who does speak for and not against the Earth; for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life; and all the humans who speak for and call for and work for peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, praised the “crystalline” writing and “capaciousness” of Harvey’s succinct novel - at 136 pages in its UK paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a book that repays slow reading,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey walks away with a 50,000 pound prize which she said she would disburse “some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest, I want to go to Japan”. (Agencies)

    China hawk Rubio gets Trump nod for secretary of state

<img alt="Marco Rubio, Trump's pick as secretary of state, has been sanctioned twice by China. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779000_1_20241114045203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he is nominating Republican Senator and noted China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, as he quickly fills out his cabinet ahead of his January 20 inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who clashed bitterly with Rubio for the presidential nomination in 2016, said in a statement nominating him: "Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said in a statement that he will work with Trump "every day to carry out his foreign policy agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the leadership of President Trump, we will deliver peace through strength and always put the interests of Americans and America above all else," Rubio said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants to Miami and vociferous opponent of Latin American communists, China and Iran, would be the first Hispanic as the top US diplomat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, and has in turn been sanctioned by Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was among a flurry of new nominations announced by Trump. He also tabbed Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, and former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also extolled Gaetz, a staunch ally who has defended Trump in his legal battles and impeachment fights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump posted on social media. "Matt will end Weaponized Government... and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  As attorney general, Gaetz would drive all aspects of the work of the US Justice Department, which for years has carried out an investigation into sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations involving him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz, who denies all wrongdoing, was told last year that there would be no charges against him, but he remains the subject of a House ethics investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican and Democratic senators immediately voiced doubts that Gaetz's nomination would survive the confirmation process, which can involve intense questioning during difficult, fraught hearings. (Agencies)

    Republicans complete takeover with House majority

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has won a majority in the US House of Representatives, American media projected on Wednesday, completing their clean sweep of Congress and handing President-elect Donald Trump vast legislative power.
 <br>
  <br>
  After more than a week of vote counting, CNN and NBC projected that the Republicans had reached the 218 seats needed to retain their majority in the 435-seat lower chamber, having already secured control over the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a beautiful morning in Washington. It is a new day in America," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who held a press conference to celebrate victory before the result was official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sun is shining, and that's a reflection about how we all feel. This is a very, very important moment for the country and we do not take it lightly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump triumphed in each of the seven battleground states in the November 5 presidential election and also won the national popular vote, with preliminary figures showing him ahead of Democratic Party challenger Kamala Harris by 3.2 million votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having control of both chambers of Congress will clear the way for him to confirm his nominations for key positions in his administration and will also allow him to push through his radical agenda of mass deportations, tax cuts and slashing regulations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traditional values of family and loyalty are vital for not just many Chinese families, but also overseas Chinese businesses seeking to win the hearts of the people in Peru, the host of this year’s Apec summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation, which is welcoming global leaders to its capital Lima this week, does most of its trade with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is home to around 170 Chinese enterprises, many of which heeded the call by the central government to look for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Chinese presence in Peru dates back to the 19th century. Chinese food is extremely popular in the country, with thousands of Chifas, or restaurants which serve mostly Cantonese dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The term Chifa is believed to have come from the Chinese words “eat rice”, meaning to have a meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from the catering industry, Chinese immigrants also thrive in other sectors, especially manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  That includes Alfredo Chang, who oversees the Calimod group, one of the most recognised footwear brands in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Employing over 600 locals, Chang runs a vast business and knows the production chain inside and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secret to success, he says, is to treat employees like family and gain their loyalty, both of which are traditional Chinese values.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our company culture is that if we treat the workers well, the workers will treat the company well too,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang recalled the difficult times during Covid, when he refused to send workers on no-pay leave even after the government granted employers the right to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had to take out bank loans to tide over the crisis. The bold move has won the hearts of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a result, many employees would turn down offers from other companies, and say, ‘I’m not leaving. This place is like family to me.’ Our company culture is that we are all a family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His son, Thomas, has plans to expand the business to nearby regions such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hopes the Chankay megaport, which is majority owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, can bring down the cost of raw materials imported from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the biggest opportunity for Peru is to really become a hub for South America. Right now with the Chankay port, the lead time from Shanghai to Peru is around 20 days. It's almost half of what is right now, and Chankay is going to be the biggest port on the [South American] Pacific,” he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The freight will be much cheaper, so that will help us probably be more competitive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added South American neighbours such as Brazil should utilise the port and fast-track their shipments to China.

    Xi to hold final talks with Biden in Peru: US official

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping will reportedly be holding talks with his US counterpart Joe Biden on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru, in what’s expected to be their last official talks before Donald Trump takes office.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior Biden administration official briefed reporters about the meeting on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect this will be their last meeting as presidents," the official said. "With that in mind, we expect the president will use the opportunity to take stock of efforts to responsibly manage competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already signaled a confrontational approach with Beijing for his second term, picking a number of outspoken China hawks for key foreign and defense positions in his top team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has also promised to slap 60-percent tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to fears of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration official would not be drawn on whether he would try to advise China on how to deal with Trump – or if he would advise Trump on how to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult, complicated, consequential relationship," the official said. "The president has been pretty clear that he even admits the competitive aspects of the relationship, we need to find ways to manage it responsibly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden heads to Lima on Thursday for the APEC summit on Friday and Saturday for his swansong at the major gathering of Asia-Pacific economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks will be the third meeting between Biden and Xi during Biden's presidency. They met in Woodside, California, last November on the sidelines of the 2023 Apec summit, and the leaders last spoke by phone in April. (Agencies)

    Bitcoin breaches US$90,000 on Trump support

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin broke through the US$90,000 level on Wednesday, as its rally showed no signs of easing on expectations that Donald Trump as US president will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has become one of the most eye-catching movers in the week since the election and on Wednesday touched record highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s value has rocketed up 32 percent since the November 5 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller peer ether has risen 37 percent since election day, while dogecoin, an alternative, volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk was up more than 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear how or when that could happen but the possibility drove a speculative surge in crypto mining and trading stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Key areas to monitor include potential regulatory changes, increased institutional participation, and a rise in M&A activity," said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new political landscape may bring clearer regulations for crypto assets and could prompt strategic developments, such as a national bitcoin reserve and growth in the mining sector." (Reuters)

    Republicans pick John Thune as new US Senate leader

<img alt="Republican senators picked John Thune as their new leader, over Texas Senator John Cornyn and Florida's Rick Scott. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778975_1_20241114012608.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Senate Republicans elected John Thune to lead the chamber next year, opting for a well-regarded insider and shrugging off a public pressure campaign by supporters of Donald Trump to pick a loyalist to the president-elect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Dakota senator's victory in a three-way contest is a sign the Senate could retain some degree of independence from Trump next year, when Republicans will control the White House and possibly both chambers of Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate and are on track to retain their majority in the House of Representatives, where several races have yet to be decided.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thune, 63, is seen as an even-tempered institutionalist and seasoned legislator who has close relationships with many of his fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He currently serves as the chamber's No. 2 Republican and will succeed 82-year-old Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history. He was first elected to the Senate in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thune prevailed over Senator John Cornyn of Texas, another long-serving institutionalist, and Rick Scott of Florida, a close ally of Trump who was backed by influential outsiders like billionaire Elon Musk and conservative commentator Sean Hannity.
  <br>
  <br>
  That made the normally clubby election an early test of Senate independence under Trump, who has not endorsed a candidate but called on the next Republican leader to give him leeway to bypass the normal system of hearings and votes to approve Cabinet nominees.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three contenders quickly signaled their openness to the idea.

  <br>
  Some of Trump's loudest supporters had expressed concern that Thune and Cornyn, who had both worked closely with McConnell, might lack the willingness to deliver on some of Trump's campaign promises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have served for two decades and delivered major legislation and helped elected other Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott, first elected in 2018, is a hardline conservative who previously served two terms as Florida governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without Rick Scott, the entire Trump reform agenda wobbly," Trump adviser Robert F Kennedy Jr. said in a post on X before the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senate Republicans resisted that pressure. The job of majority leader, they said, requires someone who has spent time building trust and support within the caucus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's worth the president using the political capital that he has to weigh in on the race," said Senator Markwayne Mullin, a Thune supporter. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump thanked President Joe Biden for pledging a smooth transfer of power as the victorious Republican made a historic return visit to the White House on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Politics is tough, and in many cases it's not a very nice world. It is a nice world today and I appreciate it very much," Trump said after the two men shook hands in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, added that the transition would be "smooth as you can get."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden greeted Trump in front of a roaring fire, offering him congratulations and saying: "Welcome back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 81-year-old Biden invited his sworn rival to the White House –despite the fact that Trump, who refused to admit his 2020 election loss, never afforded Biden the same courtesy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who dropped out of the election in July but saw his successor Kamala Harris lose to Trump last week, said he was "looking forward to having a smooth transition."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, (have) what you need," he told Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the White House visit, Trump addressed Republicans from the House of Representatives at a Washington hotel near the Capitol, which a mob of his supporters stormed in 2021 to try to reverse his election loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ebullient Trump suggested that he could even be open to a third term in office – which would violate the US constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's good, we got to figure something else,'" he said, drawing some laughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's party looks set to take both chambers of Congress and consolidate his extraordinary comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was accompanied at the meeting with Republicans by the world's richest man Elon Musk, whom he named on Tuesday as head of a new group aimed at slashing government spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has launched a flurry of nominations as he moves swiftly to name his administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest announcement, Trump said he would be bringing four advisers from his presidential campaign into his new White House as deputy chiefs of staff, including two longtime aides and the political director who played a key role in his victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming president said longtime aide Dan Scavino will serve as a deputy without giving a specific portfolio, campaign political director James Blair as deputy for legislative, political and public affairs, and Taylor Budowich as deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  All will have the rank of assistant to the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also formally announced Stephen Miller, an immigration hard-liner, will be deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. That had previously been confirmed by Vice President-elect JD Vance on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair was the political director for Trump’s campaign and, once Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee, the political director for the Republican National Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scavino was a senior adviser on Trump’s campaign and, in his first term in the White House, he worked as a social media director.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began working for Trump as a caddy at one of Trump’s golf courses, and was part of the small group of staffers who traveled with the president across the country for the entirety of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before joining the campaign, Budowich worked for the pro-Trump Super PAC, Maga Inc., and after Trump left office, Budowich served as his spokesman while working for Trump's political action committee, Save America.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Dan, Stephen, James, and Taylor were ‘best in class’ advisors on my winning campaign, and I know they will honorably serve the American people in the White House,” Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They will continue to work hard to Make America Great Again in their respective new roles.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Miller is one of Trump’s longest-serving aides, dating back to his first campaign for the White House. He was a senior adviser in Trump’s first term and has been a central figure in many of his policy decisions, particularly on immigration, including Trump’s move to separate thousands of immigrant families as a deterrence program in 2018.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gale force winds buffeted some areas of Hong Kong early on Thursday morning as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly made its way towards the Pearl River Estuary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 storm signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday and will remain in force until 10am on Thursday at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 3am, Toraji was centred around 140 kilometres south-southeast of Hong Kong, and was not expected to come much closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Observatory said the storm has been taking a more westerly track, and is moving west slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds in excess of 90 kilometres an hour have been recorded on Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn, but the Observatory said it expects the wind to weaken later in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Local winds will moderate gradually during the day on Thursday”, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung said in a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Depending on the movement of Toraji and the weakening trend of local winds, the Observatory will assess the time of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said classes of all morning and whole-day schools, including secondary schools, primary schools, schools for children with physical disability, schools for children with intellectual disability, kindergartens, and kindergartens-cum-child care centres, will be suspended on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services -- albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and Lohas Park, a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities had by 2am received one single report of a fallen tree, while there have been no reports of landslides or flooding.

<img alt="Lawmakers say governments plans to build a university town in Ngau Tam Mei will boost the overall development of the region. Image courtesy of the Development Bureau" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778938_1_20241113212704.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday welcomed the government's plan to develop a university town, including Hong Kong's third medical school, in San Tin in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the Northern Metropolis development project, authorities plan to use more than one-third of a 127-hectare land in Ngau Tam Mei to build an academic town, to bolster the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  The so-called UniTown will house a medical school, where a new hospital will be built next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said he expects the new facilities to offer advanced medical services to the residents there.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we want to develop the region, Northern Metropolis, into a big area with high-end research and a population, they would certainly expect to have good hospitals and state-of-the-art medical services," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With a university hospital in the region, you would expect this university hospital to provide state-of-the-art medical services to the people in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam believes the new hospital, along with the existing Pok Oi and North District hospitals, will be able to cope with an expected increase in the region's population.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the Ngau Tam Mei development plan, which he described as "reasonable", will offer crucial infrastructure to the nearby San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also pointed out that the development of some nearby areas, such as Au Tau located to the south of Ngau Tam Mei, has been lagging behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau called on the government to present plans to develop Au Tau and North Kam Tin as soon as possible.

    'HK plays pivotal role in advancing green finance'

<img alt="A side event forum is held at this year's COP29 China Pavilion in Azerbaijan. Photo courtesy of Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Financial Services Development Council" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778937_1_20241113210609.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a green group said on Wednesday that it is important to further promote Hong Kong's status as a leading green financing hub on the global stage, highlighting the pivotal role of the city's financial expertise in advancing transition finance and fostering investment in sustainable projects throughout the region.
 <br>
  <br>
  Friends of the Earth (HK) and the Financial Services Development Council this week co-hosted a forum titled "Advancing Transition Finance and Cross-Border Green Financing – Engaging the Public to Achieve a Net-Zero Economy" at the COP29 China Pavilion in Azerbaijan where the United Nations Climate Change Conference is being held.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plato Yip, chairman of Friends of the Earth, said more people attended the event this year than in Dubai a year ago, proving that people from other countries are interested in what Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is a lot of interest how Hong Kong has issued like green bonds. We topped Asia. We actually issued one-third of Asia's green bonds and [people are interested in] how we are so successful in doing this. I think it's also because people understand that climate finance is so important for effective climate change mitigation and resilience programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The side event really helped us help Hong Kong and amplify our voice on green finance on the global stage. We do have very strong financial infrastructure, very supportive policies and talented professionals."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there is optimism China and Europe can play leading roles in shaping the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most participants would acknowledge that the global green economy or green transformation is under way, particularly focusing on energy transformation or energy transition. This process is largely supported by China's supply chain. I have to note that Hong Kong has a huge role to play here too because coupled with the technology from China and the edge of Hong Kong's green finance, this is the winning formula," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip also said that a methane fee for major oil and gas producers was finalised by the Biden administration in the United States, but that some people fear the measure could be scrapped with Donald Trump returning to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can expect him to take a more sceptical view on climate change initiatives, which might lead to a rollback of some US policies and measures, and this could create some uncertainty in the market and potentially slow down climate action from the US side. I think it's also important to remember that the global push for sustainability and low-carbon economy is still very strong and unlikely to be completely derailed by any one administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many countries and regions like the EU, China, Canada, Australia, and etc., they are all very committed, [and are] still very committed to their climate goals, regardless of what happens in the US, I think. Plus, there's another important factor is that the private sector is increasingly aware that sustainability is key for their long-term resilience and profitability."

 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will issue a T8 storm signal at 11.10pm on Wednesday, as Tropical Storm Toraji edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said that Toraji has moved on a more northerly track towards the coast of Guangddong in the past few hours, adding that gale winds and squally showers will affect Hong Kong overnight and on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory added that Toraji will be closest to the Pearl River Estuary Thursday morning, skirting around 150 kilometres south of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that the T8 storm signal will remain until at least 10am on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR rail and bus services, along with the local section of high-speed rail link, will remain normal for the rest of the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company added that services on open sections of the railway, Light Rail and bus will be suspended immediately if T9 or above is issued.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to build the city's third medical school in San Tin in Yuen Long, as part of the Northern Metropolis development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a proposal submitted by the Development Bureau to the Legislative Council, officials outlined the allocation of more than one-third of a 127-hectare plot in Ngau Tam Mei to develop a university town, which will house the medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project to build the so-called UniTown will begin in 2027 at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Covering 46 hectares, the plot is larger than the proposed 30 hectares revealed by Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Wednesday, Development Bureau officials said they decided to arrange more land for local institutions to collaborate with mainland and overseas universities to build schools there, to help boost the SAR's status as an international education hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they did not say how many educational institutions will call the UniTown home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Science and Technology has expressed interest in running Hong Kong's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to build a hospital with 3,000 beds near the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital will be used to cope with the potential population growth in Yuen Long and North District thanks to the area's development, and to train doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said the development project in Ngau Tam Mei will create about 13,000 housing units – mainly private homes – with the first batch of residents expected to move in from 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will reveal the cost of the project before construction begins.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey said she will be taking a three- to four-month break from the sport to consider her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" had mentioned before the Paris Olympics of possible retirement, which she said on Wednesday is still on her mind after the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai, Incheon and Singapore during which she won five gold, two silvers and two bronze medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to use this break to think about what my future direction will be. These three stops at the World Cup has made me realise that I am getting old, and that my body recovery is taking more time," the 27-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will be competing at the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest from December 10 to 15 before taking the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is looking forward to spending the Christmas holiday with her family because she spent previous years taking part in competitions around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she hopes to use the break to do things that she usually doesn't get to do because of training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey was speaking to reporters after a ceremony at the South China Athletic Association where the newly completed Water Sports Centre was named after her.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she feels honoured given that she spent a lot of time practising at the association as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she participated in the design for the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this isn't just meaningful to me, but I hope it's meaningful to the community because I'm trying to use what I'm doing to promote swimming and to promote sports," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that the next generation can be here to witness this, and hopefully they find some sort of inspiration through all of this and think this is meaningful too."

    'UK officials, business leaders very interested in HK'

 Executive Council convenor and New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip on Wednesday said her party had fruitful exchanges with British government officials, think tanks and business leaders during a recent visit to the UK.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The key takeaways are that they are very interested in Hong Kong's development – in particular the development of our financial markets, our family offices, our connectivity schemes with mainland China, [and] the Greater Bay Area development," Ip told reporters after leading a delegation to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said in response to questions from some UK media outlets about the national security laws in Hong Kong, her delegation assured them that the provisions are on par with British laws, and that press freedom is alive and well in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We explained to them our two national security laws actually only affected a very small number of people. All the trials were conducted openly in full transparency, and nobody has been able to point any finger at the quality of the judgements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On US president-elect Donald Trump possibly naming Marco Rubio as secretary of state and how this could affect the SAR, Ip said she hopes the Florida senator would visit Hong Kong to clear up "misunderstandings".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, drawing condemnation from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope he will actually visit Hong Kong to see the true situation in Hong Kong, and not just listen to a small minority of Hong Kong people who have a twisted view of One Country, Two Systems," Ip said.

 A man appeared at West Kowloon Court on Wednesday on suspicion of publishing seditious posts on social media.
 <br>

  The 57-year-old suspect is accused by national security police of repeatedly publishing seditious posts on social platforms inciting hatred towards Hong Kong and central authorities, and inciting violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was charged with "knowingly publishing publications that had a seditious intention".
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was not required to enter a plea and was remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been adjourned to December 30.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday that part of the money it earmarked for implementing a waste charging scheme has been used on other green policies, after the programme was shelved in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was responding to a written question from Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, who noted that the scheme's estimated expenditure for the current financial year was more than HK$580 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment chief Tse Chin-wan said in response that the money has been reallocated, to things including strengthening recycling facilities and improving publicity on waste reduction and recycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff have also been redeployed to build up community and food waste recycling networks, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a revised estimate for the Environmental Protection Department for this financial year will be released in next year's budget, for the scrutiny of lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government's contracts with designated garbage bag and label suppliers are still ongoing, but they don't mandate production and storage quantities, and payment is needed only for the actual amount produced.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These contracts are still in effect at present and we will continue to maintain communication with the suppliers and properly handle all issues in accordance with the contract provisions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse added that agreements with major retail chains and wholesalers run through 2027, and officials have collected all unsold bags and labels from them, and are verifying sales figures for making payments.

    Govt, DAB hold jobs fair for ethnic minorities

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is determined to build an inclusive work environment for ethnic minorities (EM), Undersecretary for Labour Ho Kai-ming said as he officiated at the opening ceremony of a jobs fair on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ho told reporters that the Labour Department has been assisting non-Chinese people in landing government jobs, such as relaxing language requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have provided some case management projects to provide some help for them to work. Last year, we have helped about 500 EM employees to take up jobs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, we have adjusted our Chinese proficiency levels to help them enter the government to work, but all of the civil servants need to know some Chinese. Therefore, we will discuss with departments continuously to employ more EM citizens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal Opportunities Commission chairwoman Linda Lam, meanwhile, said job fairs are a way to promote a more racially diverse workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The language barrier is a common hurdle [for EM job-seekers], but other factors such as bias and stereotypes exist too," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have reached out to our racially diverse network of employers to bring in job openings that could be promising for potential employees from diverse races and qualifications, and have their language barrier thoughtfully considered," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobseeker Rizwan who was at the fair said he has been looking for a job for around a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once I went into the job market, [not knowing Chinese] was very tough. They [companies] do require you to either speak Chinese or they want you to have a lot of other experience. But in the CV and experience I show, they say that I don't have that experience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-Chinese students were also taken to the event to learn how to search for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think every non-Chinese students is used to that [discrimination] in Hong Kong, a little racism here and there. But it's not too bad. People just want to judge, and you can't change the way other people think," said Nareena, 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she will maintain her confidence and continue to pursue her dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The job fair, co-organised by the Labour Department and the DAB's ethnic minority committee, is being held in Mong Kok for two days. A total of 50 companies will participate in the fair, offering more than 3,100 job openings.

    EOC talking to catering sector about discrimination

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) on Wednesday said it is actively communicating with the catering industry on ways to enhance awareness among staff about anti-discrimination measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paralympian Ho Yuen-kei, who uses a wheelchair, recently complained that she was denied entry into a restaurant due to limited space. The restaurant apologised to the athlete after the incident, but the matter sparked public concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent discussions have aroused public attention about the need to pay regard to the welfare of persons with disabilities and the importance of not to discriminate against them because of their disability. We treat this as a very positive development," said EOC chairwoman Linda Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will work on what has been discussed in the media, including the general consensus that there is a need to enhance education and awareness of service providers in the catering industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the commission published guidelines last November on how to ensure a barrier-free environment in restaurants, and has held seminars on providing accessible technology for food ordering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the watchdog will continue to have discussions with the industry about exploring training options, especially for frontline workers.

    T3 will be in force until 11pm, higher signal possible

<img alt="The T3 signal was issued at 2.40pm and will last until at least 11pm, with a higher signal possible depending on the intensity of Toraji's winds. Image courtesy of the Hong Kong Observatory" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778862_1_20241113150332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) issued the T3 storm warning signal at 2.40pm, while warning that Tropical Storm Toraji may come closer to Hong Kong than earlier anticipated.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say winds will pick up as Toraji creeps towards Hong Kong. As of 5pm on Wednesday, Toraji was around 210km southeast of the territory but is now expected to come between 150 to 200km of the city either on Wednesday night or Thursday morning -- compared to an earlier estimate of around 200km.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory says the T3 signal will remain in force until at least 11pm on Wednesday night, and a higher signal is possible after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the degree of weakening of Toraji when it edges closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary and the change of local wind conditions”, the Observatory said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKO also said winds in Hong Kong are strengthening gradually due to the approaching storm, combined with the effects of the northeast monsoon. More showers and squalls are also forecast. Gusts of wind in excess of 78 kilometres an hour have been measured at Tate's Cairn in Ma On Shan Country Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  As seas are rough, the Observatory said members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens as well as schools for children with physical disability and intellectual disability were suspended for Wednesday, and that the premises should stay open to accommodate students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The light-and-sound show "A Symphony of Lights" scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said all child care centres, centres providing after school care programmes, elderly services centres and day rehabilitation units will remain open under normal operating hours.
