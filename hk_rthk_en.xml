  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon, triggering widespread flooding and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (59 mph), the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a powerful cyclone is expected to barrel into India's eastern coast early on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dana is expected to cross the coasts of the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal between midnight Thursday and Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The states expect to evacuate around 300,000 people each, and Odisha has already moved 50,000 people to relief shelters. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea "won't sit idle" over the North's deployment of thousands of troops to help Russia fight Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Thursday, slamming it as a "provocation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency has claimed that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia training, likely to deploy to the frontlines against Ukraine soon, with thousands more troops to be sent by December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato and Washington have confirmed that Pyongyang's soldiers are now training in Russia, warning that if they were to join the fight against Kyiv, it could mark a dangerous escalation of the grinding war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "South Korea won't sit idle over this," Yoon said after talks with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding that the two countries agreed North Korea's deployment was "a provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poland's Duda spoke to Yoon on Thursday, after which the two leaders "strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations“.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has previously denied deploying forces to Russia, while Moscow has not confirmed it, but has defended its military cooperation with Pyongyang. (AFP)

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between 10pm on Thursday and 4am on Friday as Tropical Cyclone Trami edges closer to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is expected to gradually move towards the vicinity of Hainan and come within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Thursday night or Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon signal could be possible on Friday or Saturday, depending on the storm's movement and any change in local wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said Trami could linger in the vicinity of Hainan or move eastwards across central and northern parts of the South China Sea early next week.

  <img alt="Ombudsman Jack Chan says the Planning Department and Lands Department need to work together more rather than solely focusing on their own affairs. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776001_1_20241024135514.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two separate government departments that deal with unauthorised land use should start working more closely with each other and share intelligence to put a stop to offenders, the Ombudsman said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jack Chan said he has come up with 16 recommendations for the planning and lands departments on how they can better tackle the hundreds of complaints they get each year about problems such as people filling in ponds without permission or turning green belt land and conservation zones into car parks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said the Planning Department's enforcement action sometimes fails to deter repeat offenders and such people should be given less and less time to comply with enforcement notices for each subsequent breach they make.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lands Department, meanwhile, needs to improve guidelines and training for staff so they can better deal with priority cases in a timely manner, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ombudsman said getting different parts of the government to collaborate more is one of his major goals and to this end, the planning and lands departments "should work together in such cases and to sort it out, instead of one department handling its own matters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also recommended the two departments establish a database for unauthorised development cases "to facilitate interdepartmental intelligence sharing and enforcement, as well as formulate targeted measures for high-risk sites to nip problems in the bud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the two departments vowed to strengthen cooperation with each other, such as by conducting joint enforcement operations against large-scale unauthorised cases through a pilot scheme, and setting up a high-level communication platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Planning Department also said it would continue to tackle illegal developments to meet public expectations and streamline its enforcement workflow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the Lands Department, it said it would review existing guidelines and enhance staff training to follow up on cases in a timely manner.

    Boeing workers reject contract, extend strike: union

  <img alt="The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the Boeing 737 MAX and 777. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776000_1_20241024133808.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing workers in the Seattle region decisively rejected the US aerospace giant's latest contract offer on Wednesday, extending their nearly six-week strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost two-thirds – 64 percent – of the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 rejected the contract, the union said on social media platform X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest Boeing offer had included a 35 percent wage hike, but did not reinstate a pension plan sought by many employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 33,000 hourly workers with the IAM have been on the picket line since September 13, when workers overwhelmingly rejected a Boeing proposal for a new four-year contract to replace the expiring pact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the 737 MAX and 777.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase to make up for years of tepid salary growth that have not kept pace with inflation and that employees complain leave them unable to afford living in one of the most costly regions of the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 years of sacrifices, we still have ground to make up, and we're hopeful to do so by resuming negotiations promptly," Jon Holden, president of the Seattle union, said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is workplace democracy – and also clear evidence that there are consequences when a company mistreats its workers year after year," Holden said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ten years of holding workers back unfortunately cannot be undone quickly or easily, but we will continue to negotiate in good faith until we have made gains that workers feel adequately make up for what the company took from them in the past," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said Wednesday night the company had no comment on the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extension of the strike adds to the troubles facing Boeing and its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who earlier Wednesday expressed measured optimism the latest contract would be ratified. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The development minister on Thursday said that her bureau will consider merging the City Gallery in Central with a new exhibition hall in Wan Chai, which will showcase major development projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Development Bureau said the HK$600 million exhibition will feature projects such as the Northern Metropolis as well as the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Bernadette Linn acknowledged that some people have expressed concerns over the amount of money involved in the project, but stressed that the construction fee is similar to that of other government buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also revealed that the government will take into consideration lawmakers’ suggestion to merge the City Gallery with the new exhibition hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The City Gallery showcases Hong Kong's planning history. It also exhibits part of the Northern Metropolis project because we don't have anywhere else to showcase the project," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lawmakers have suggested the existing exhibits in the City Gallery could be merged together with our proposed facility in a larger gallery hall, so that the City Gallery can be vacated. We think it's a good suggestion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Linn added they hope the new facility in Wan Chai will open in 2027.

   A concern group for construction site safety on Thursday said authorities could consider using Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) records as a more reliable way to verify workers’ employment histories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suggestion came after the anti-graft agency ICAC said it arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences, which involved applicants attending phony courses, and receiving documents claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chair of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner’s Education and Training Committee, Lee Kwong-sing, said people are seeking shortcuts to obtain licences to improve their job prospects because the construction industry is doing well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The expert also pointed out that there is a loophole in the current way work experience is verified, in which only an employer’s letter is required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If authorities required MPF contribution records, it would be much harder to fake qualifications. Applicants would need three to five years of records to qualify, which requires long-term planning," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But that's not the case now. At the moment they can just verify using an employer's letter, which seems a bit casual."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said 100 excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Simon Tang, co-founder of home decoration consultancy Deco Academy, told RTHK that unlicensed electrical work might lead to improper installations and high repair costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the installation part, if the lines are just installed in the concrete directly without passing through the plastic pipe, when there is water leakage, for example, then it may cause high repair costs and it may cause danger for the residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang said an electrician's licence is often needed for those carrying out home renovation work, but the authorities don't always scrutinise these licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The checking is a very selective process. So they do not check every case. And also, they do not scrutinise all details. Basically, they do not scrutinise every submission. And there's no penalty if the submission is not successful," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland tourists joining new tours of Hong Kong shopping malls won't be obliged to go on a spending spree, a retail industry representative said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Travel Industry Council and Retail Management Association have devised 14 different itineraries for "in-depth tours" of five shopping centres in the city, with participants promised the chance to hear some  "urban legends" during their two-hour visits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Association chairwoman Annie Yau Tse said that while participants will be received by a mall representative and will be offered discounts on their spending, they will be free to roam around and can decide for themselves where to make any purchases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With concerns that tourists are spending less in Hong Kong, Tse said it will be down to the shops in the malls to try to get visitors to splash the cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is that there are customers around. Once they come into the malls, we can think of ways to attract them to consume," she said on an RTHK programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there are no customers at all, then really nothing can be done. So when there are more people around, that's already an advantage for us."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first-ever discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong is a "momentous" achievement and could mark the beginning of a series of exciting finds in the wider region, a palaeontologist said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced on Wednesday that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, have been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery of these bones is super exciting because we have rocks of the right age and the right environment but having looked for so many years, different people have not been able to find dinosaur bones, including myself," said Michael Pittman from the School of Life Sciences at Chinese University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From what I hear they seem to be from some larger dinosaurs. I've seen pictures of models that are of long-neck dinosaurs and the hadrosaur dinosaurs, so these are among the biggest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman said the find was also "very lucky" since Hong Kong isn't an ideal location for fossil preservation, given that the territory had a lot of volcanic activity in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that finding dinosaur bones in the SAR is challenging due to the topography and landscape.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There have been Jurassic-age fish, there have been older Devonian fish. Very interesting, but not like large volumes of fossils, and that's partly because there's not much area to look for fossils. Also, the rocks are quite hard and they don't readily erode out fossils," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we look for fossils, we typically go to a place where you can easily access them, and we focus on places where there are lots and lots of fossils, so it's rich in fossils and makes it easier. So because of those various reasons I mentioned, Hong Kong hasn't been a focus point for looking for fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said China is one of four main countries in the world for dinosaur fossils, along with the US, Canada and Argentina, but the Guangdong area is famous only for dinosaur eggs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman also welcomed the signing of an agreement between the Development Bureau and the mainland's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, to deepen exchanges and cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously, finding some fossils in Hong Kong enriches our local palaeontology heritage. But my hope is the agreement would help to further exchanges with the institute, which people like myself have been working for for more than a decade," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dinosaur fossils will be on public display at the Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park from Friday.

    'Civil servants welcome new family-friendly measures'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday revealed that civil servants and unions have welcomed its move to offer more family-friendly measures, with officials expressing the hope that the rest of society would follow suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes after Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his Policy Address last week that civil servants with children under three can get three days of childcare leave annually starting next April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, the Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung was asked if the government is taking the lead by rolling out more family-friendly measures, to which she responded: “We hope the whole society can offer more childcare measures to help parents.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added that the reaction to the new measure has been "really good". "The unions and other civil servant colleagues have welcomed the measure and are looking forward to it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after the show, she said the government will monitor the measure – expected to benefit some 12,000 employees – after it takes effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will review how this works out and see if there is room for improvement, or whether it really affects our work seriously.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also pointed out that a number of factors have led to a 10-percent vacancy rate in the civil service, and that the government needs more time to deal with the manpower crunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past few years, we've seen a high retirement wave. It's simply because of the age of civil servants. And also, the number of graduates is not as many as a decade ago. So we have to really compete for talents,” Yeung said.

    Raphinha scores hat-trick as Barcelona thrash Bayern

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Raphinha hat-trick handed Barcelona a 4-1 win against Bayern Munich in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a clash that pitted five-time winners Barca against six-time champions Bayern, it was the home side that stole the show thanks to a triple from Brazilian attacker Raphinha and a goal from in-form veteran Robert Lewandowski.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harry Kane levelled after Barca's first-minute opener for his fifth goal of the campaign but was helpless as his team collapsed to their second defeat in three Champions League outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In my opinion this game could have been a Champions League final," Raphinha said. "To be able to win it in this way, so well, in front of our fans, is quite special – and I leave here happy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result leaves Bayern in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are 10th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha sent the hosts on their way at the Olympic Stadium inside 60 seconds, tucking home after rounding goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kane levelled in the 18th minute with an acrobatic volley from a Serge Gnabry cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ex-Bayern player Lewandowski then restored Barca's lead in the 36th minute by pouncing on a loose ball after Fermin Lopez had snuck behind the visiting defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha got his second on the stroke of half-time with a curling effort off his right side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brazil international's third on 56 minutes showcased Barca's danger on the counter as he galloped onto a swept pass from Lamine Yamal before arrowing home a left-footed finish with both centre-halves trailing in his wake. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World leaders called for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine at the summit meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he welcomed offers to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin also said the summit's agenda covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, as well as settling regional conflicts and moving to expand the Bric group of countries. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Turkey said it launched strikes on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday after blaming them for an attack that killed five people at a defence firm near Ankara.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A further 22 people were wounded in the attack, which the government said was "very likely" carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, "an air operation was carried out against terrorist targets in the north of Iraq and Syria," the defence ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A total of 32 targets belonging to the terrorists were successfully destroyed," it said, adding that operations were continuing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies, the PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. It has a number of bases in Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the attack that sparked the strikes, a huge explosion rocked the headquarters of state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) some 40 kilometres north of Ankara shortly after 3:30 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It sent clouds of smoke into the air as the sound of gunfire rang out, Turkish media reported, with the incident quickly denounced by Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya as a "terror attack."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry "targeting the survival of our country," in a message on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yerlikaya said three of the injured were in critical condition and that the two attackers, "a woman and a man," had been "neutralised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate claim for the attack but Yerlikaya said: "The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts to identify the perpetrators of the attack were ongoing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defence Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at "PKK villains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As they always do, they tried to disturb our nation's peace through a despicable and dishonourable attack... we will make them suffer for what they have done," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Media reports earlier said the assailants had killed him and taken his taxi to carry out the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up" while other outlets reported exchanges of fire for more than an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haberturk TV said there was a "hostage situation," with another media pundit saying "a number of hostages" had been rescued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkish authorities imposed a blackout of live images from the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabah newspaper published what it said was a CCTV image from the entrance showing a black-clad young man with a moustache carrying a rucksack and what appeared to be an assault rifle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As night fell, dozens of ambulances could be seen waiting in convoy near the site, their blue lights flashing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of Turkey's top defence firms and a major arms producer, TAI employs 15,500 people and has a vast production site covering an area of five million square metres, its website says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack drew condemnation from across Turkey and beyond, with Putin offering Erdogan his "condolences in connection with the terror attack" at the start of their meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Statements of condemnation and condolences to the families of the victims also poured in from Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Tehran and Washington and Nato leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack came as Turkey's political establishment appeared to be leaning towards a political, negotiated solution to the decades-long conflict with the Kurdish militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The timing was not lost on the main pro-Kurdish party, Dem, the third largest force in parliament, which said it was "noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took place a day after the head of the far-right MHP, which belongs to Erdogan's ruling coalition, invited jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to address parliament to announce his movement's dissolution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives, with Ocalan held in solitary confinement on a prison island since 1999. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland's spectacular acrobatic effort lit up Manchester City's 5-0 win over Sparta Prague on Wednesday to move into third place in the Uefa Champions League table.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Norwegian scored twice, including a backheel at shoulder height, as City ran riot against the Czech champions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil Foden, John Stones and Matheus Nunes were also on target for Pep Guardiola's men, who remain unbeaten in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's a freak isn't he," said Foden of Haaland's athleticism. "If I tried to do that I'd pull my groin. I don't know how he did it, I just think it's just his long legs."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sparta had taken four points from their opening two Champions League games against Salzburg and Stuttgart, but City were a step up in class too far for the visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It became painful in the second half after it went to 2-0. It became very difficult and we had difficulty coping with it," said Sparta coach Lars Friis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foden's struggle for form and fitness has compounded City's injury problems with Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had nine efforts on goal in total but was frustrated in the first half as Sparta refused to let the floodgates open before the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Haaland did finally deliver City's second with an effort reminiscent of his strike against old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that won Champions League goal of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was an amazing goal – I was speechless after he shot," said Nunes. "When he scored against Dortmund, I was watching on TV and to see this live was amazing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are now unbeaten from open play in 26 Champions League matches, setting the longest unbeaten streak by any club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victory takes Guardiola's men onto seven points from their opening three Champions League games, behind only Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Villa. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 27th minute tap in from Darwin Núñez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mo Salah hit a perfect header across his body.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nunez jumped high to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're really happy for the win – we played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts, apart from the last few minutes," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I asked for a goal. Darwin gave us one, but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist," he added. "It was a team goal – it's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. (AFP)

  <img alt="Ohtani's 50-50 baseball was sold for the highest price for any ball in any sport at an auction. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775948_1_20241024081610.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ball hit by Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani for his 50th home run of the season sold for a record-breaking US$4.39 million, auction house Goldin said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The home run saw Ohtani become the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit 50 home-runs and steal 50 bases in a single season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Shohei Ohtani made history with this baseball, and now, with the highest sale price for any ball ever sold," Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of the auction house, said in a statement. "This legendary piece of sports memorabilia has made history again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received bids from around the world, a testament to the significance of this iconic collectible and Ohtani's impact on sports," he added. "I'm thrilled for the winning bidder."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The record price for a baseball was previously the US$3.05 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball of 1998.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani's 50th home run of the season came during a spectacular offensive outing for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Marlins in Miami on September 19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had six hits in six at-bats, including two doubles, for a total of five extra-base hits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He drove in 10 runs, scored four himself and stole two bases to help the Dodgers clinch a postseason berth that will mark Ohtani's first trip to the MLB playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani had already stolen two bases in the first two innings to take his tally to 51 for the season when he turned up the power at the plate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He smashed his 49th home run of the season in the sixth inning then established the 50-50 club with a second homer in the seventh – belting a curveball from Mike Baumann into the left field stands at loanDepot Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fan who caught it reportedly turned down the Dodgers' offer to purchase it for US$300,000 and wasted little time in consigning it with Goldin. (AFP)

    LeBron and son Bronny share court in NBA first

  <img alt="LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775904_1_20241023211949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   LeBron and Bronny became the first father and son to play in the NBA together on Tuesday night during the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener, fulfilling a dream set out a few years ago by LeBron, the top scorer in league history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, it’s a moment I’m never going to forget,” LeBron said. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Father and son checked into the game against Minnesota simultaneously with four minutes left in the second quarter, prompting a big ovation from a home crowd aware of the enormity of the milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old LeBron had already started the game and played 13 minutes before he teamed up with his 20-year-old son for about 2 and a half minutes of action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James is a four-time champion and 20-time All-Star, while LeBron James Jr was a second-round pick by the Lakers last summer. They are the first father and son to play in the world's top basketball league at the same time, let alone on the same team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Y’all ready? You see the intensity, right? Just play carefree, though,” father told son on the bench before they checked in, an exchange captured by the TNT cameras and microphones. “Don’t worry about mistakes. Just go out and play hard.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron contributed 16 points in the Lakers' 110-103 win. Meanwhile, Bronny had an early offensive rebound and missed a tip-in, and his first NBA jump shot moments later was a 3-pointer that came up just short.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He – who, like many first-year players, is not expected to see significant floor time this season – checked out one possession later with 1:19 left in the second quarter, getting another ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “(I) tried not to focus on everything that’s going on around me, and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny said. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. The dream became real after Bronny entered the draft as a teenager following one collegiate season, and the Lakers grabbed him with the 55th overall pick. (AP/Reuters)

    Pelicot trial calls for rape law changes in France

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   France may introduce changes to its rape law to include consent for the first time, after a mass rape trial shook the country, challenging the limits of existing legislation and prompting some leading politicians to call for change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging his wife and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious and 50 men are facing trial alongside him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite video evidence against them, at least 35 of the defendants have denied the rape charges, claiming that Dominique Pelicot tricked them into believing they were taking part in a sex game, or that Gisele Pelicot was feigning sleep.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case has prompted deep soul-searching in France, with consent at the heart of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am determined that things change in this society," Gisele Pelicot told the Avignon court on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public, and has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said. "It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators).”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France’s new Justice Minister Didier Migaud recently said he is in favour of updating the law, as has President Emmanuel Macron, after France blocked the inclusion of a consent-based rape definition in a European directive in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe it is beyond understanding for our fellow citizens to refuse to include consent in the definition of rape," Migaud told lawmakers earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 2023 survey by one of France's main polling institutes, IFOP, found that nine out of 10 people polled wanted France to support the EU directive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Consent-based rape law already exists in Sweden, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other European countries, with the rise of the feminist #MeToo movement prompting legislative reform in some jurisdictions since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, French criminal law defines rape as a penetrative act or oral sex act committed on someone using "violence, coercion, threat or surprise." It makes no clear mention of the need for a partner's consent and prosecutors must prove the intention to rape to secure a guilty verdict, five legal experts said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed decidedly lower on Wednesday as investors adjusted their expectations for bold central bank interest rate cuts, while major tech names came under pressure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended 1.0 percent down at 42,514, while the S&P 500 slid 0.9 percent to 5,797.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq plunged 1.6 percent to 18,276.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The losses came as US Treasury yields climbed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The economic reports are such that people are losing faith in the idea that we're going to get aggressive rate cuts," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another possible reason for the increase in yields is the US presidential election outcome next month, he said, noting that "neither candidate is talking about anything resembling fiscal discipline."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There could be "nervousness" that inflation might creep back in, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major firms came under pressure as well, with tech giant Apple's shares down 2.2 percent and Nvidia shares losing 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fast food giant McDonald's slumped 5.1 percent amid a severe E coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Boeing closed 1.8 percent down after reporting a whopping US$6.2 billion quarterly loss as a labour strike bogged down its commercial plane division. (AFP)

   A longer and greener Wine and Dine Festival opened on Wednesday, as locals and tourists flocked to the harbourfront to indulge themselves in culinary treats and fine wines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong kicked off the event and told the crowd, "Do not get drunk. You have one more day to enjoy all the great wines. And I know you will do it judiciously, prudently and soberly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm proud to say that Hong Kong has emerged as a global wine hub, where wine lovers can enjoy ever-growing selections of wines from all over the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival starts on Wednesday night and lasts five days - up from four previously - until Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers are also keen to cut down waste, with disposable plastic cups now prohibited at the venue, in line with the government's ban on single-use plastics. Visitors can encouraged to bring their own glasses, or they can purchase one on-site for HK$50.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hundreds of tourists who arrive on cruises have been invited to join the fest, according to tourism chief Kevin Yeung, while shuttle buses also run between the venue and the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint to facilitate cross-border visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship event by the Tourism Board features over 300 booths, serving foods and drinks from 35 countries and regions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bayley, a tourist from the United States, was impressed by the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] very different from a festival in the States… [In the US] it wouldn't be this organised," she told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having it not only in country, but also they say wine and food, and having all the pictures. That's not a thing in the States."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was German tourist Tanja's first time at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm overwhelmed because there's so much to see, and so much to discover. We enjoy very much. It's very nice. We do not know where to start and where to end…We have to come back again," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Anton, a German expat working in Hong Kong, wine was what attracted him to the fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was surprised to see so many people turn up on opening night, given it's only Wednesday and most still needed to work the next morning.

   President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on member countries to build Brics for peace and act as guardians of common security in an address at their summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also spoke about three principles to help defuse the Ukraine crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his speech, the president urged Brics countries to advocate peaceful co-existence and harmony between civilizations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said Brics members should support sustainable development, and that China is willing to leverage its advantages to expand cooperation with the bloc in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Ukraine, Xi urged Brics nations to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, with an aim towards de-escalating the crisis as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed offers by Brics leaders to mediate in the conflict, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many countries "expressed a desire to contribute more actively" to resolving the conflict, state media cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters on the sidelines of the summit. (Xinhua & agencies)

    Govt mulls ways to crack down on fake accountants

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials on Wednesday said they are looking at ways to crack down on unlicensed accountants in the city by revising auditing standards, with lawmakers saying the measure will help maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said that accountants may be required to provide their practising certificate number when signing audit reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On his blog, he wrote that companies may also be required to provide the practising certificate number of accountants who helped sign the audit report along with their profits tax returns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accounting sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said that currently, it is almost impossible for the government to check if the accountants signing the reports are licensed or not, as most of these documents are submitted in paper form.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They are pretending that they are licensed to sign off audit reports and sign off reports recklessly without any supporting document behind. In such cases, the unlicensed issues have seriously damaged and impacted our profession's reputation in the past years," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the proposed measure would help uphold the SAR's reputation and status as an international financial centre, though he admitted it may take some time for companies to get used to the change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It might be causing some inconvenience and difficulties at the beginning, especially for the first few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But as we all know, by 2030, the profits tax return has to be filed electronically. By that time, all those data, including the practising numbers could easily be collected by the government."

   A 34-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman remain in police detention, after Narcotics Bureau officers on Tuesday discovered 24 litres of suspected liquid cocaine, hidden in red wine bottles.

   Police arrested the mainland man and local woman in an anti-drug operation at a car park on Tat Chee Avenue in Sham Shui Po.

   Officers allegedly found the suspected liquid cocaine hidden in 16 1.5-litre bottles, inside a suitcase belonging to the woman.

    More workers, funding needed for social services

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A council that represents non-governmental social services organisations on Wednesday said most groups they spoke to are facing manpower shortages and money issues, with nearly half of them expecting less funding next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Council of Social Service said it surveyed more than 140 organisations and found that nearly 86 percent of them faced staff shortages and that a lot of experienced social workers have retired or left the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Chua Hoi-wai said it is vital to invest in new talent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think different kinds of training [are needed]. And not only this, but we also should try to attract more people joining our profession, joining our sector," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want more people to understand the impact of social welfare services so that we can gather more cross-sector collaboration and we can also attract more talents to join our sector."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In terms of funding, Chua said the council found that 78 percent of the organisations polled are dealing with cash shortfalls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the economic situation in the SAR is contributing to a drop in donations, adding the survey found that nearly half of the firms it spoke to anticipate a decrease in funding and donations for 2024-25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We would not have enough resources to provide the needy social services, and another issue is when we say that we have a lack of manpower, actually the cost of manpower has increased in these few years," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chua also said the council encouraged NGOs to invest more in digital transformation to help reduce costs or increase efficiency.

    New book addresses questions about sex, relationships

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Family Planning Association has introduced a new book to address questions about relationships and changes during puberty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau Wai-wai, an education officer from the association, on Wednesday said the book covers various topics including body image, sexual orientation and sexual identities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we are addressing body image, when we are addressing bodily changes, when we are addressing sexual desire, we try to make it positive. It's part of life, it's part of growing up," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong's sex education came under the spotlight recently when officials released a set of teaching materials suggesting that rather than acting upon sexual impulses, young people should consider going to play badminton instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics said the advice was “out of touch”, but the Education Bureau said the materials aim to teach pupils how to protect themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau said she wants to see more comprehensive sex education in the school curriculum.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hong Kong is a stressful society. Also in schools, teaching time is very limited. In that case, sex education is squeezed into different subjects,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “So there's no independent subject or not even compulsory in the curriculum. In that sense, of course, we would like to see sex education included more in the curriculum.”

    Wine and Dine vendors keep spirits high

  <img alt="The Wine and Dine Festival will run for five days until Sunday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775865_1_20241023171411.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival have expressed confidence in business, with some expecting double-digit growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event runs until Sunday at the Central Harbourfront with over 300 booths offering food and drink.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of those reappearing at the festival is MyiCellar, which specialises in Kweizhou Zhenjiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-founder Tomy Wu said his company is eyeing a 30-to-50 percent increase in business amid the growing popularity of Chinese baijiu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “More and more people know about baijiu, so we expect the revenue and sales to increase quite significantly, compared with last year,” Wu said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect, in the long run, sales to increase, because the lower tax rate is beneficial to those middle- to high-end products. Very likely, we will also use the tax cut to decrease the price of the products.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first time, the festival features exhibition areas about the United Kingdom, Australia, Chile and Thailand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tracy Cheung, senior brand manager of Edrington Hong Kong, is optimistic about the company’s debut at the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We expect there will be quite a lot of customers interested in the products because this is the first time we have a ‘UK Pavilion’ at the Wine and Dine Festival, and it’s also our first time to participate in this big festival,” Cheung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are expecting roughly 1,000 to 2,000 cocktails per day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unlike in the past, this year’s festival lasts for five days instead of four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zachary Chan, co-founder of Hong Kong Liquor Store which has joined the festival for about a decade, said the longer event will help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We should be able to do better sales than last year. This year, we got some new products we are promoting at our booth. We got whiskey and gin from different places. We’ll be doing a lot of cocktails. I think that’s one of the areas of growth is a lot of people are looking for cocktails. That’s one of the focuses we are doing this year,” Chan told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “With the extra day and everything, we are hoping to do 15 percent more than we did last year overall.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forum Restaurant, which last took part in 2017, is expecting business to grow 30 to 40 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive chef Adam Wong said the boost could come from people who choose to stay in Hong Kong to spend.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government said on Wednesday that officials have approved applications for nearly 29,000 imported workers in the past year, after restrictions on overseas labour were lifted for 26 types of job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval figure relates to the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) which began in September last year and is separate from similar programmes that allow the importation of workers for  construction, transport and care home posts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said officials received applications to import more than 66,000 workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 29,000 or so given approval amount to 44 percent of the total number of applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Waiters topped the list of workers coming in with 5,200 approvals, followed by 3,200 cooks and 2,900 junior cooks, Sun said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chau asked the government to suspend the scheme to protect local workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The Labour Department] has been closely monitoring the implementation of ESLS, and will review [the scheme] prior to the lapse of its two-year implementation period," Sun said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister added that officials have received 62 complaints from the imported workers, mainly over issues involving wages and working hours.

    ICAC arrests 148 over fake professional qualifications

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ICAC on Wednesday said they arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those arrested include construction workers and people who are suspected of providing fake qualifications services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The anti-graft body's principal investigator Glory Leung assured the public that no safety issues have been found so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have [reviewed] works they handled [in the past], whether there's any industrial accident, or other event that led to safety issues, but so far there are no safety issues in those applications involving false qualifications," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ICAC said the cases involved criminal masterminds who provided fake courses, with training for excavator operator licences costing about HK$22,000 and those for electrician licences costing between HK$500 to HK$1,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Upon completion of a fake course, applicants would receive a document claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Labour Department, and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Departments (EMSD) – which are involved in the issuance of working licences for both professions – said they have been cooperating with the watchdog in the law enforcement process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said it launched investigations on training course providers, and its staff members, while the EMSD said it reviewed the registrations of those concerned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One hundred excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The departments said they will continue to review and improve their admission and approval procedures to ensure registration standards.

    Event organisers asked to make use of cruise terminal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Wednesday said the authorities will continue to work on getting event organisers to make use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a Legco meeting, lawmaker Chan Yuet-ming said business near the terminal is bleak, especially when compared with the situation around Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Yeung said it was unreasonable to compare the two facilities as their purposes are different, adding that it would be impossible to use a lot of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal for commercial purposes without a complete revamp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the authorities are trying their best to make use of the facility and attract local residents to visit it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We understand that there won't be cruises docking at the terminal every day. On days without a cruise, we want to make use of the area. There are different exhibitions held, and we encourage organisers to hold large-scale events," Yeung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we have to consider the timing, there may only be four or five consecutive days without a cruise, and this limits the variety of events to be held at the terminal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Edward Leung suggested building helipads at the terminal to boost the low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[We want to] build our cruise economy and attract tourists to come to Hong Kong to take a ride on the helicopter. We are now trying to promote a low-altitude economy, so cruise passengers could take helicopter rides to view Victoria Harbour or go to the Geopark," Leung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said the government is looking into whether there is any room to build new facilities at the site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We definitely have to consider the feasibility technically, for example, whether the load-bearing capacity of the cruise terminal is enough for more facilities or holding more events... but this would be one of the ways of development to be considered," he said.

   The leaders of China and India will on Wednesday meet on the sidelines of the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's the first bilateral meeting between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in five years, which comes just days after the two countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There will be a bilateral meeting held between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping... on the sidelines of the Brics summit," senior Indian Foreign Ministry official Vikram Misri said on Tuesday.

   <br/>
   On Monday, the two countries reached a deal on the disputed Himalayan frontier in the Ladakh region to end a four-year military stand-off, paving the way for improved political and business ties between the Asian giants. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said Hong Kong saw a 16-percent jump in visitors from ten mainland cities in the third quarter, following Beijing's decision to allow individual visits from these places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Individual Visit Scheme was expanded in March and May, and it involved the cities of Qingdao, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Bureau revealed the boost in mainland tourist numbers in a response to a question from tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu, who also chairs the China Travel Service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said more than 140,000 inbound visitors came from the ten cities between July and September, adding that since the visit scheme's expansion, some officials had visited these places and encouraged their trade representatives to tour the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since April this year, the Tourism Board has distributed nearly 30,000 sets of discount vouchers, each valued at HK$200, to visitors from the ten cities through travel agents and airlines," the bureau said in a written reply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that it will continue to work with the trade to look for business opportunities and promote two-way tourism exchanges with mainland cities.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's industry chief told Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing on Wednesday that he hoped the US tech giant would continue to deepen its presence in the country, an official statement on their meeting showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped "Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market", according to a ministry statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jin also said he hoped Apple would "increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to expand high-level opening up," Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a "better environment" for global investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wednesday's meeting saw the two exchange views on topics including "Apple's development in China, network data security management, [and] cloud services", the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook is visiting China for the second time this year, a trip that has seen him meet with university students and try out the iPhone 16's camera in a historic Beijing district with fashion photographer Chen Man.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm fell to number six in a ranking of smartphone vendors in China during the second quarter of the year – from number three during the same period last year – according to analysis firm Canalys. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, providing 160 beds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named "YOT Hub", it is the fifth such project to be granted approval under the Subsidy Scheme for Using Hotels and Guesthouses as Youth Hostels which began last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "YOT Hub is well connected by public transport with comprehensive community facilities in the vicinity. This project not only provides young people with a comfortable living environment but also enables them to broaden their horizons and achieve their personal development goals through various self-enhancement activities," a government spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Programmes such as training and internship will be provided for tenants to deepen their understanding of national development opportunities.

    Emma Raducanu becomes latest to pull out of HK Open

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Wednesday announced that former US Open champion Emma Raducanu will not take part in the tournament, a development that comes on the heels of star player Naomi Osaka's decision to drop out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two of the big names out, organisers stressed there will still be an "incredible line-up of marquee stars" at the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that top players – including defending champion Leylah Fernandez, former world number one Simona Halep, and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun – will be taking part in the event which runs from October 26 to November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong China Tennis Association said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Raducanu will not be participating in the all-female tournament and wished her a speedy recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, and we do hope that she will be back competing as soon as possible," the statement added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's decision comes after four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Briton continues to rehab from a foot injury she sustained in the quarter-finals of the Korea Open in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m sorry to say that I will not be able to play in Hong Kong next week," Raducanu said in a statement through the association. "While my foot is making good progress, I need a little more time before I am match fit," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's spot in the draw has since been filled by 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former education and housing secretary Michael Suen, who was best known for his measures to combat a housing crisis two decades ago, has died at the age of 80.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen joined the government in 1966 and held various positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his tenure as housing minister, he rolled out nine measures to revive the property market in 2002, after it plummeted to record lows following the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures included halting regular land auctions, as well as suspending the Home Ownership Scheme and the selling of subsidised housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics argued that the drastic reduction in housing supply brought on by the measures led to housing shortages and soaring property prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Suen served as education minister from 2007 to 2012 before retiring.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee expressed sorrow over the death, saying Suen made great contributions to the government over the years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He had formulated strategies and provided counsel to the HKSAR in various policy areas, addressing different challenges while promoting Hong Kong's development. He commanded great respect from government colleagues and members of the community with his dedicated service to the public over the years," Lee said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Housing Secretary Winnie Ho also expressed sorrow, saying Suen's connections with housing affairs started when he joined the Housing Authority in 1973.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Education minister Christine Choi said Suen put in place many important education policies including the "334" academic structure, adding that his achievements will continue to have an impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cultural, sports and tourism chief Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, praised Suen for his contributions to various government policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Executive Council convenor and New People’s Party lawmaker Regina Ip said Suen played a crucial role in the SAR's development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was in charge of many important policy areas, including constitutional development, land, housing and planning, and before his retirement, education. When I first met him, he was a district officer in Sha Tin, and he was responsible for clearance of Tai Wai to make room for the construction of Sha Tin City One. So he really played a very important role in Hong Kong's development over many decades," Ip said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2011, Suen was diagnosed with kidney failure and contracted Legionnaires’ disease the same year.

    'No bid splitting for the govt's Youth Post hostel'
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said it does not plan to split the bidding for its proposed youth hostel and cultural exchanges facility, saying that could contradict its aim of fostering exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had announced in his Policy Address that authorities would convert the existing Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into the Youth Post, where young people coming from outside Hong Kong would stay and interact with locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak told an RTHK programme that bid splitting is not cost effective and will also contradict the government's aim of setting up the place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our bidding direction is that the operator has to have relevant experience. It doesn't have to be in charge of the whole venue, which is so big, because there are a lot of different areas," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can look for groups or organisations to manage this place together. But if we were to split the bidding, it would actually restrict the operator's plan on how to use this facility."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities hope to begin the bidding process by the end of this year, and open the facility in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And with officials already drafting the tender for the bidding, Mak emphasised that the operator has to be financially independent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operator has to consider how it is going to operate the site. They have to be financially autonomous. The government won't invest anymore. The government might also consider charging for rent – I believe the plot of land won't be given for free. The operator has to consider how to manage their losses and gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for improving the transport network in the area, Mak said she hopes to tackle the issue with other departments.

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

    Celtics trounce Knicks to begin NBA title defence

  <img alt="Celtics' Jaylen Brown dunks the ball in the second quarter against the New York Knicks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775773_1_20241023102438.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jayson Tatum scored 37 points as the Boston Celtics launched the defence of their NBA crown with an emphatic 132-109 defeat of the New York Knicks on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a triumphant pre-game ceremony that saw Boston celebrate raising their record-breaking 18th championship banner, the Celtics delivered a performance that suggested they could well be the team to beat once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A devastating 43-point first quarter put Boston in complete control during the first half, with Tatum producing an electric shooting performance to pour in 18 points from three-point range over the two quarters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum had brought the house down in a pre-game address to a packed TD Garden, signalling the Celtics' determination to win back-to-back championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is special. On behalf of me, my teammates, the organisation, we couldn't have done it without you last year," Tatum told the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let's enjoy this moment together," he added. "I can honestly say, to the best fans in the world – let's do it again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boston powered to last season's NBA championship after winning 64 games in the regular season before dropping just three games in the playoffs, sealing victory with a 4-1 rout of the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That win came after years of frustrating postseason disappointments, which included a 4-2 defeat to Golden State in the 2022 NBA Finals and an agonising 4-3 loss to Miami in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Celtics have retained the core of the team from last season's roster and look well-positioned to mount a serious defence of their title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against New York on Tuesday, Joe Mazzulla's team picked up where they had left off in June, with all of their heavy-hitters coming up big to leave the Knicks chasing the game for long periods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four of the their five starters – Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday – posted double-digit points tallies before half-time, helping the team take a commanding 74-55 lead into the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Knicks had enjoyed parity in a 31-31 second quarter, the Celtics were in no mood to let their advantage slip after the break, coasting home to close out the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum finished with 10 assists and four rebounds in addition to his 37 points, with White adding 24 points and Brown 23. Holiday added 18 while Al Horford chipped in with 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Brunson led the Knicks scoring with 22 points, alongside Miles McBride with 22 from the bench. (AFP)

    Aston Villa beat Bologna, go top of Champions League

  <img alt="Aston Villa's John McGinn with teammate Jhon Duran. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775757_1_20241023081956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Uefa Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't want to stop here – it puts us in a great position," said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we are building here is amazing," he added. "This is home for me – it is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to "break barriers" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything," said Emery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season. (AFP)

    Glasgow named host for 2026 Commonwealth Games

  <img alt="Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) CEO Katie Sadleir. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775755_1_20241023081604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The future of the 2026 Games was thrown into doubt when the Australian state of Victoria, the original hosts, withdrew last year, citing rising costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Scottish government effectively gave the green light to Glasgow last month and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Tuesday that the 2014 hosts will stage the next Games, from July 23 to August 2, 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Games will feature just 10 sports compared with the 19 on show at the 2022 edition in the English city of Birmingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Para sport will once again be fully integrated as "a key priority and point of difference for the Games", with six para sports included on the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The schedule will feature athletics and para athletics, swimming and para swimming, artistic gymnastics, track cycling and para track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para bowls, as well as 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the sports missing out compared to the 2022 Games are triathlon, diving, hockey, T20 cricket, squash, badminton and rugby sevens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 3,000 athletes are expected to compete from up to 74 Commonwealth nations and territories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CGF said Glasgow 2026 would deliver more than US$130 million of inward investment into the city, with no need for public funding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia will provide part of the finance after Victoria pulled out, citing a projected cost of more than US$4 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On behalf of the entire Commonwealth sport movement, we are delighted to officially confirm that the 2026 Commonwealth Games will take place in the host city of Glasgow," said CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commonwealth Games, held every four years, evolved out of the British Empire Games and is still made up mainly of countries and territories once subject to British imperial rule. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Uefa Champions League on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their "standards slip" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta had urged his players to use the "pain" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks finished with little change on Tuesday, digesting a trove of mostly solid earnings while shrugging off higher treasury bond yields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After opening lower, major indices pushed into positive territory in the afternoon before losing steam after that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The market is just kind of grinding and not doing a whole lot," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's indicative of a market taking a step back."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended essentially unchanged at 42,924.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,851, while the Nasdaq added 0.2 percent at 18,573.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that there's a tension between the fact that yields are rising which obviously means that bonds are more competitive with stocks," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the other hand, it's also indicative that the economy might be stronger than we thought it may have been. So you have that tension there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, General Motors shot up around 10 percent as it raised its full-year forecast, reflecting strong vehicle pricing that boosted third-quarter earnings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But GE Aerospace slumped 9.1 percent despite increasing its annual projections amid strong demand. However, analysts pointed to lingering concerns connected to a Boeing strike that has shuttered two US plane production plants. (AFP)

    Blinken in Israel to push for Gaza truce

  <img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his 11th trip to the Middle East since the Gaza war erupted.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a big US push for a ceasefire in Gaza, met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday after Washington called for an end to the war in Lebanon "as soon as possible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken began his meetings in Israel as Hezbollah launched rockets into Tel Aviv and Haifa, and Israeli air strikes pummelled parts of Beirut's southern suburbs, including an air strike that caused a multi-storey building to entirely collapse and sent a fresh wave of panicked residents fleeing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His meetings with Netanyahu and other top officials also come as Israel weighs its response to Iran's October 1 missile attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to bring an end to both the year-long war in the Palestinian territory Gaza and to its spillover conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah said on Tuesday there would be no negotiations while fighting continues, and claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Netanyahu's holiday home on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington hopes the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar – Israel’s most wanted man, blamed for triggering the year of warfare by planning the deadly attacks on October 7 last year on Israel territory – will provide a new opportunity for peace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Israel has so far shown no sign of relenting in its military campaigns even after assassinating several leaders of Iran's allies Hamas and Hezbollah, which lost its powerful secretary-general Sayed Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netanyahu has pledged to annihilate Hamas and recover dozens of hostages held by the group. Hamas says it will only release the captives in return for a lasting ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken's week-long trip to the Middle East will also take him to Jordan and Qatar. US officials say he is focusing on plans for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war, necessary for reaching a ceasefire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington has long said it ideally wants Gaza reunited with the West Bank under a government run by the Palestinian Authority, which now exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli occupied West Bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Blinken also plans to speak to Israeli leaders about the expected strike on Iran and discourage any move that could massively escalate regional conflict, an official on the plane with him said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gaza war began after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities on October 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed 42,718 Palestinians, Gaza health authorities say. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Another monkey at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens has died, bringing the death toll to 12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Leisure and Cultural Services Department said a De Brazza’s monkey that had been put under isolation died on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A necropsy has been carried out to determine the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It followed the deaths of 11 monkeys since the middle of the month, caused by sepsis after they caught melioidosis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said earlier workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure and might have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said the zoo's mammal section remains closed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also said the health conditions of 78 mammals and staff caring for the animals there are normal.

    Fresh bid to draw tourists to shopping malls

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Tuesday announced a new programme to arrange in-depth tours for tourists at shopping malls during mega events in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In collaboration with the hotel and retail sectors, the TIC has put 14 itineraries from six travel agencies on the China Mobile "MyLink" app targeting mainland visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A bar-hopping tour in Tsim Sha Tsui during the Wine and Dine festival and a tour featuring Hong Kong's urban legends are among those on offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fanny Yeung, the TIC's executive director, said the programme aims to leverage the city's mega events and encourage visitors to explore shopping malls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because right now a lot of individual travellers seldom visit shopping malls, and it didn't help us in our retail area. So we would like to include the retail part into this kind of in-depth tour to target this group of travellers," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Annie Yau Tse, chairwoman of the Retail Management Association, said five shopping malls will be covered, namely the IFC mall in Central, K11 Musea and THE ONE in Tsim Sha Tsui, Langham Place in Mong Kok, and the Temple Mall in Wong Tai Sin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said participants will receive gifts and discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After the pandemic, individual travellers come to Hong Kong for tourism experiences rather than shopping, so the current capacity is enough. [The new initiative] to bring group tourists to shopping malls is well within our capacity to accommodate," she said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they are investigating whether two men arrested in Tai Po for suspected burglary are connected to Sunday's break-in at the home of former police commissioner Andy Tsang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers received a report at 10.30pm on Monday that a flat at the Wonderland Housing Estate was burgled, with three watches worth around HK$290,000 being stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two men, aged 31 and 36, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We found that the two suspects were hiding under a motorcycle cover outside a house in the village. When police identified themselves to the suspects, one of them tried to struggle and flee. He even pushed the police, causing the officer to suffer from a broken finger," said chief inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said both suspects are two-way permit holders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that the burgled flat is 1 kilometre away from Tsang's home, which was broken into on Sunday evening. A small amount of jewellery, watches and cash were stolen.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have arrived in the Russian city of Kazan for the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi was greeted at the airport by Russian officials upon his arrival on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailed ties between the two countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined," Xi told Putin, praising the "profound friendship" between Beijing and Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ties have "injected strong impetus into the development, revitalisation and modernisation of the two countries" and have "made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice," Xi said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the two sides "have found the right way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other which features non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party," according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are among the leaders joining the Brics gathering in Kazan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also undertaking his first trip to Russia since April 2022 to attend the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as the largest foreign-policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of US-led efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brics alliance, which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed an interest in joining. (Agencies)

    HSBC restructures operations in overhaul

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday it would combine its commercial and investment banking operations in a major overhaul under new CEO Georges Elhedery that has also seen key senior staff depart.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seeking to simplify the Asia-focused bank's business and reduce costs, HSBC said it would be restructuring into four business units and slashing senior management positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new leadership structure, which includes the appointment of Pam Kaur as the lender's first female chief financial officer, would "unleash our full potential and drive success into the future," Elhedery said in a memo to staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elhedery, like many bank executives, is under pressure to address climbing costs and better manage expenses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group is carving up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. The new corporate and institutional banking unit will house a newly combined commercial banking and global banking and markets business, and western wholesale banking businesses, including Europe and the Americas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kaur, 60, who currently serves as HSBC's chief risk and compliance officer, joined the bank in April 2013 as group head of internal audit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jon Bingham, interim Group CFO, will resume his role of Global Financial Controller, HSBC said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other key management changes, Greg Guyett, CEO Global Banking and Markets, will assume a newly created role of Chair, Strategic Clients Group. Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank and Europe, has decided to step down to pursue other opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank, which employs about 214,000 people globally, has been removing duplicate roles for years and reducing its businesses in Western markets such as the United States, France and Canada as it focuses on Asia and markets where it has scale. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Beijing said on Tuesday it had reached a "resolution" with India over issues related to the border, after New Delhi said it had struck a deal with central authorities for military patrols along the frontier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Recently, China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues relating to the China-India border. Currently, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant issues," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China and India, the world's two most populous nations, have regularly accused each other of trying to seize territory along a narrow strip of land known as the Line of Actual Control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a border skirmish in 2020 that killed four Chinese soldiers, and at least 20 Indian ones, both sides pulled back tens of thousands of troops and agreed not to send patrols into the Line of Actual Control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lin said on Tuesday that Beijing "gives its positive approval" to the deal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the next stage, we will work with India to properly implement that resolution," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lin, however, did not say whether the deal paved the way for an official meeting between President Xi Jinping and India's leader Narendra Modi at the Brics summit in Russia this week. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   MTR officials have warned that services on the Tung Chung Line are expected to be curtailed late on Saturday night, with no trains travelling between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations as major track diversion works take place as part of the Tung Chung Line extension in the two hours before the line's usual closure time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung will depart at 11.01pm, while the last train going all the way to Tung Chung will leave Hong Kong Station at 11.07pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay and vice-versa will run as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company’s chief of airport segment, Ben Lui, said services might also be affected on Sunday if there is any delay to the works.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We have done a lot of preparation and planning, and our team will work closely together. Hopefully, we will have all the works completed before the next traffic day,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will try our best, and strive for the early completion of the works, without affecting train services on the next day.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With a tropical cyclone expected to move closer to Hong Kong, the works may be postponed to the following Saturday if the weather is too bad, Lui said.

    Auctions for Lunar New Year fair stalls kick off

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four fast food stalls at Victoria Park's annual Lunar New Year fair were auctioned off on Tuesday for a total of more than HK$600,000 with authorities saying the result reflected the current market sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot," he told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bidding was less competitive because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23.

    N Korea denies it sent troops to Russia

  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea has not sent troops to Russia to help Moscow fight Ukraine, one of its United Nations representatives said on Monday, dismissing Seoul's claims as a "groundless rumour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency had said that Pyongyang sent a "large-scale" troop deployment to help its ally, claiming that 1,500 special forces were already training in Russia's Far East and ready to head soon for the frontlines of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for the so-called military cooperation with Russia, my delegation does not feel any need for comment on such groundless stereotyped rumours," a North Korean representative said at a committee meeting during the UN General Assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's claims were "aimed at smearing the image of the DPRK and undermining the legitimate, friendly and cooperative relations between two sovereign states," the representative told the meeting, held late on Monday in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korean state media have not commented on the purported troop deployment, and Russia has also not confirmed the troop deployment, but defended its military cooperation with the North.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Seoul summoned Moscow's ambassador in South Korea to complain, the envoy "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neither Nato nor the United States have confirmed the deployment, but both have cast it as a potentially dangerous escalation in the long-running Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have seen reports the DPRK has sent forces and is preparing to send additional soldiers to Ukraine to fight alongside Russia," Robert Wood, US ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If true, this marks a dangerous and highly concerning development and an obvious deepening of the DPRK-Russia military relationship," Wood said. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 late on Thursday or early Friday, if Tropical Cyclone Trami follows its projected path and edges closer to Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to the present forecast, Trami to the east of the Philippines will intensify gradually and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong," meteorologists said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, which is Vietnamese for a type of Camellia, is expected to move west towards the vicinity of Hainan in the coming days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon warning signal could eventually be possible, depending on the storm's movement and wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters also warned that the weather will deteriorate this weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Under the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon, it will be windy and become cloudy with a few showers over the coast of southern China later on Friday and over the weekend."
