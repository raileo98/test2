  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ruben Amorim was on Friday named as the new manager of Manchester United, replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old Portuguese coach, who won two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon, has signed a deal until 2027 and will join the club on November 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ruben Amorim as head coach of the men's first team, subject to work visa requirements," the club said on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He will join until June 2027 with a club option of an additional year, once he has fulfilled his obligations to his current club."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United described Amorim as "one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until Amorim arrives at Old Trafford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United sacked Ten Hag on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them languishing 14th in the Premier League, with just three wins from nine matches. (AFP)

    Boeing workers to vote on new contract offer

  <img alt="Boeing workers who have been on strike since September are set to vote on a new contract offer next week. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777245_1_20241101192259.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Striking Boeing workers will vote on Monday on an improved contract offer that includes a 38 percent pay rise over four years and a larger signing bonus, and carries the endorsement of their union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest offer, presented on Thursday, comes after Boeing this week announced it would raise up to US$24.3 billion to shore up its battered finances as a seven-week strike by more than 33,000 factory workers in Seattle worsens its cash burn.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labour. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future," the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, Boeing said it encourages "all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4,” noting that the average machinist will make US$119,309 by the end of the contract if the offer is accepted, up from US$75,608.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's first offer of a 25 percent wage increase, which was endorsed by the union, was rejected by nearly 95 percent of workers in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, some 64 percent of workers rejected an offer of a 35 percent general wage increase over four years that was not endorsed by the union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's latest offer also includes a US$12,000 ratification bonus, the IAM said in a statement. It combines a previously offered US$7,000 ratification bonus and a US$5,000 lump sum into the members' 401(k) retirement account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other conditions in the contract remain unchanged, such as an annual bonus and the company's commitment to build its next plane -- expected in 2025 -- in the Seattle area, where Boeing was founded in July 1916.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The negotiating team, however, had been pushing for a 40 percent wage increase, as well as the return of a defined-benefit pension that members lost a decade ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX jet and its 767 and 777 widebodies. (Reuters/AFP)

    Drivers to hand over phone number or email for licence

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Drivers will have to provide a verified Hong Kong mobile number or email address when applying for or renewing their licence from November 18, the Transport Department announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The requirement will enable the police to start issuing any fixed penalty notices by digital means – a move which is set to begin in the first half of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think there is much difficulty because nowadays people get used to technology a lot. What we are changing is only from a paper ticket to an electronic form. All the information is provided in that SMS or email," police superintendent Nip Hoi-kwan said at a press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nip added that he thinks the digitalisation will cut the time officers spend on paperwork for a penalty notice, from around 30 minutes to 15.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Helen Lee, a principal executive officer with the Transport Department, said measures are in place to ensure the security of the information collected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Transport Department adopts the government cloud infrastructure services, which provide a very reliable and secure infrastructure for the Transport Department to collect and keep the personal data collected through the verification platform," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moreover, the data collected will be transferred to our central system immediately, so we will not keep any data in the platform."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales were down 6.9 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official data released on Friday showed that the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.6 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drop followed a revised 10 percent fall in August and an 11.7 percent decrease in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic fall, with a 26.7 percent drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nevertheless, an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures, and a possible easing of the Hong Kong dollar alongside the US dollar with the commencement of the US interest rate cut, would be conducive to boosting sentiment and supporting spending," a government spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the sector is pessimistic about sales for the rest of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's anticipated that many local people will travel abroad during the Christmas period, and certain domestic-related retail categories are expected to see a decline in business," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Due to the absence of Christmas holidays on the mainland, the tourist-related retail categories, such as watches and jewellery, are also expected to perform worse than last year."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan says it's extraordinary that Hong Kong scientists are joining the country's latest Antarctica exploration, with icebreakers Xuelong and Xuelong 2 setting sail along with a third ship on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mission to the South Pole is China's 41st and will last for more than half a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a ceremony marking the ships' journey, Chan said Hongkongers' participation in the mission marks an important milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not only does this show the country's recognition of Hong Kong's polar scientific research, it also highlights how the SAR can play a pro-active role in the country's scientific research missions," the minister said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan expressed the hope that local scientists can make full use of the country's platform to conduct solid research and make greater contributions to the nation in science and innovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also noted that this year is the 40th anniversary of the start of China's polar expeditions, saying the country's efforts and achievements attract global attention and reflect a powerful nation's responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

    More universities added to Top Talent Pass Scheme

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Another nine universities on the mainland and four overseas have been added to the list of institutions covered by Hong Kong's Top Talent Pass Scheme, bringing the total to 198.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new mainland additions are Sichuan University, Beihang University, Southeast University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Tongji University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, Nankai University and Tianjin University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The overseas newcomers are the Royal College of Art, University of the Arts London, Parsons School of Design, The New School, and Rhode Island School of Design.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Bureau said that in January, the complete list of universities will be reviewed and subsequently updated, given that their eligibility is based on world rankings which will change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first arrivals under the scheme will see their visas expire in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To make it easier for them to renew their visas, the Immigration Department said it will bring the application period forward, from the current four weeks before expiry, to three months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Labour Chris Sun said extension approvals will be granted based on various factors, such as the person’s income, tax payments and time spent in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Labour Bureau said Category A applicants of the scheme – those who had an annual income of at least HK$2.5 million prior to application – will now have their first visa validity period extended to three years instead of two.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau explained that these people enjoy a better employment rate in Hong Kong compared to other applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that almost all of the Category A applicants are married and it hopes a longer visa will encourage them to bring their families to settle down in the SAR.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tuen Mun Hospital revealed on Friday that a patient was administered 10 times the prescribed dose of a sedative last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hospital said the patient is in stable condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuen Mun Hospital said the individual sought treatment at its accident and emergency department on October 18 and was arranged to transfer to intensive care because of a medical condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While in the accident and emergency department, the patient was prescribed sedatives to assist with the subsequent medical procedures. Before being transferred to the intensive care unit, medical staff discovered that the dosage of the sedative injection received by the patient was 10 times the prescribed dosage," a hospital spokesperson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The patient did not show any abnormal reaction, and is now staying in a general ward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The hospital is very concerned about the incident, and has contacted the patient's family to explain and apologise," the spokesperson added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hospital said it had reminded staff to follow guidelines on the injection of drugs, while vowing to review the workflow of the accident and emergency unit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuen Mun Hospital has reported the case to the Hospital Authority, and set up a committee to the investigate the root cause and make recommendations for improvements.

    AI tech to scan for abuse at children's home

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Surveillance cameras equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) technology are to be used to look for any signs of abuse at one of the city's residential homes for children, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI should automatically raise the alarm if it detects inappropriate behaviour such as children been slapped or shaken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said money for the technology was made available to the Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) after its Children's Residential Home in Prince Edward was embroiled in an abuse scandal involving multiple members of staff in 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To help the Society for the Protection of Children improve the quality of care given to children and increase their efficiency in monitoring childcare services, the government has appropriated money from the Lotteries Fund, allowing the society to use AI technology in surveillance cameras, so that inappropriate actions can be identified at an early stage," Sun said at a seminar on child protection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI-equipped cameras should be in use from June next year, the minister added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HKSPC said that two years ago it began monitoring its surveillance camera footage on a weekly basis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are two levels of monitoring, first by Children's Residential Home staff. They will randomly choose two hours of CCTV footage to review and see if there is any misbehaviour or questionable behaviour," said director Subrina Chow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will then be followed by a second review from a child safeguarding consultant. They will review what has already been reviewed by first level staff, and randomly choose another two hours of footage to see if there is any condition that requires attention."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong will host a general assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) for the first time in 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association, which consists of 206 National Olympic Committees, announced on Thursday that the SAR had won the bid to organise the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association gathers all its members at a general assembly every year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The international sports body plans to organise a five-day gathering in Hong Kong, which will include seminars and an awards ceremony.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement released on Friday, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary, Kevin Yeung, said the successful bid demonstrates international confidence in Hong Kong's capacity to host large-scale sports events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will fully support and guide the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China in hosting this important international meeting, co-ordinating close co-operation between relevant government departments and various sectors including tourism and business," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president of the sports federation and Olympic committee, Timothy Fok, said they will start working with government departments as well as the sports and business sectors to prepare for the assembly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng also said the hosting of the assembly will strengthen the SAR's status as a hub for mega events in Asia.

  <img alt='Applicants for the Quality Migrant Admission System now just need to complete a questionnaire with 12 "yes or no" questions. File photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777188_1_20241101135842.jpg&q=55" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials on Friday advised tens of thousands of people waiting for months to find out whether they can move to Hong Kong under the Quality Migrant Admission System to scrap their applications and start again via a new process they hope will be quicker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 80,000 applications are in limbo, with the waiting time for them to be vetted stretching to about nine months, according to the Immigration Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say the new process they've devised should slash the application process down to about six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Instead of filling out details and having officials score them item by item, from now on applicants will only have to complete an online questionnaire and answer 12 "yes or no" questions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Younger people will no longer get a higher score and applicants now just need to state whether they are 50 or under.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Multiple doctoral or master's degrees won't improve an applicant's chances anymore and they just need to state whether they have one from one of 198 universities covered by the Top Talent Pass Scheme, or one of six business schools ranked among the top ten in the world over the past five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other ways to get a “yes” include having an annual income of HK$1 million or above, owning a company with an annual profit of HK$5 million or above, or having work experience of five years or more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Being bilingual or having good English writing and speaking skills is another way to get a "yes".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Those who get six or more “yesses” on the questionnaire will be referred to a government internal review committee, run by Secretary for Labour Chris Sun, who will then pass its recommendation to the Immigration Department for a final decision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Bureau said it would advise existing applicants still waiting to find out whether they've been accepted to withdraw their original application and file another one to get a speedier decision.

    'More proactive approach needed to protect children'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children on Friday urged the public and businesses to do their bit to create a safe and positive environment where children can thrive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The call came as the society carried out what it said was the city's first survey on awareness and perception of child safety.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll of more than 1,400 people over the summer found that about 75 percent lacked an understanding of the issue, the group said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[Child safeguarding] is actually a more proactive approach. We look at the entire environment more comprehensively to adopt preventative measures to protect our children," said the society's director, Subrina Chow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The general public needs to understand there are a lot of precautions or preventative measures that organisations, schools, the government, individuals and private enterprises can take to ensure the environment is safe and healthy enough for children to use and experience," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four hundred of those surveyed work with children and 71 percent said they did not receive any training on child protection, while 62 percent were unaware of whether their company has policies in this area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The society said only 37 percent of the workers reported having completed a Sexual Conviction Record Check (SCRC) before starting their jobs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The scheme is important for colleagues who work with children face-to-face and especially those who will work alone with children," Chow said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having the government to mandate the SCRC for certain services would be important, for example residential services, where staff would be staying in the same space with children most of the day, they should definitely go through the check before being allowed to work with children."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The society suggested the government strengthen public awareness on safeguarding children and lay out protection policies.

    Morant leads Grizzlies over Bucks, Rockets hold on

  <img alt="Grizzlies' Morant drives the ball against Bucks guard Damian Lillard. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777176_1_20241101123409.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ja Morant's 12th career triple-double fired the Memphis Grizzlies to a 122-99 NBA victory over the reeling Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday as Houston edged the Dallas Mavericks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but teammate Damian Lillard was held to four points on 1-of-12 shooting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook Lopez was Milwaukee's next-highest scorer with 12 points as the Bucks dropped their fourth straight after opening the season with a win over injury-hit Philadelphia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morant was the engine, scoring 26 points with 10 rebounds and 14 assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just came out being aggressive, took what the defense gave me," said Morant, who piled up 21 points in the first half to help Memphis build a 70-48 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had plenty of support as seven Grizzlies players, including all five starters, scored in double figures. Milwaukee never got the deficit below 18 points in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everybody was kind of in a good rhythm, we got it going early," Morant said after Memphis bounced back from a lethargic loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We got stops," he said. "We were boxing out, we were getting out running, playing our game – that's how we want to play. If we want to do something in this league, that's what we've got to do each and every night."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bucks are clearly missing the contribution of injured Khris Middleton, who has yet to play this season as he recovers from an ankle injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I thought we played with the right spirit," Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. "We didn't make shots and you're going to have nights like that. But on those nights we have to find a way to get stops.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Morant had a free pass tonight as far as driving – we've got to do a better job of trying to figure out how to contain guards like that," Rivers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, in Dallas, the Rockets finally got the better of their Texas rivals, leading by as many as 23 points and hanging on for a 108-102 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Green scored 23 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who had lost six of their last seven games against the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Green scored 11 in the fourth quarter to help the Rockets fend off a late Dallas surge. Dillon Brooks and Alperen Sengun added 17 points apiece for Houston, who out-rebounded Dallas 50-37.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mavs star Luka Doncic scored 15 of his 29 points in the final period, his step back three-pointer with 1:08 remaining pulling Dallas within three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amen Thompson and Brooks responded with baskets and the Rockets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 28 points for the Mavs, but Klay Thompson was the only other Dallas player to score in double figures with 12. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   More than 30 people reportedly suffered minor injuries and one was more seriously hurt on Friday when a ferry collided with a pier in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A vessel operated by Tsui Wah Ferry smashed into Central Pier No 9 as it was docking there at around 7am, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chartered ferry had earlier left Tsim Sha Tsui and was to take workers to an HK Electric construction site in Lamma.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Assistant Divisional Officer Hung Shing-yau from the Fire Services Department said the 34 injured passengers were taken to hospital for treatment, with one of them suffering rather serious injuries to the back and hand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hung added that there were 118 passengers and two members of staff on board the vessel at the time, with the rescue operation completed in around 20 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Senior Marine Officer Cory Keung said an investigation is underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “After the inspection, the ship... is not seriously [damaged]. No water intake and no oil pollution was found,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The last inspection was conducted in March this year and all was in good condition.”

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A worker was rescued on Friday morning after being suspended mid-air from a building in Kowloon Bay for about an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened at around 9am when a suspended platform fell from the sixth floor of Telford House on Wang Hoi Road, leaving a worker hanging by his safety harness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is understood that the man was carrying out maintenance work on the building's exterior when a suspected mechanical failure caused the platform to drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency personnel were called to the scene and brought the worker to ground safely.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Halloween has helped bring thousands of revellers out to wine and dine in the city's night clubs, with Lan Kwai Fong chairman Allan Zeman calling it the busiest he could remember.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was probably the busiest I've ever seen and I started Lan Kwai Fong about 30 years ago," Zeman told Hong Kong Today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He estimated that more than 60,000 people came out to celebrate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the big night, some bar representatives had forecast a 10 percent rise in sales, but Zeman said many businesses reported a revenue surge of 25 percent or more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said Hongkongers were in the mood to celebrate after some tough years and there was pent-up demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was just a sea of bodies and costumes and just people having the greatest time that they've ever had. I've never seen so many people come out (to Halloween)," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zeman said there was a good mix of revellers, with about 25 percent from mainland China. Another 15 to 20 percent were westerners - probably tourists - and the rest were locals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said many bars and clubs were booked up two weeks in advance, including reservations made a month in advance "which we've never ever had before".

    Spain flooding death toll rises to 158

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain mourned at least 158 deaths on Friday as authorities told people in flood-stricken regions to stay at home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An exceptionally powerful Mediterranean storm from Tuesday unleashed heavy rains and torrents of mud-filled water that swept away people and wrecked homes, with the eastern Valencia region hit hardest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The body coordinating rescue work in Valencia announced 155 bodies had been recovered there by Thursday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials in Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia had announced a combined three deaths in their regions on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But "dozens and dozens" of people remain missing two days after the start of the catastrophe, government minister Angel Victor Torres told reporters, raising fears the death toll could rise further.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some rural areas also remain inaccessible to rescuers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Please, stay at home... follow the calls of the emergency services," pleaded Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European officials pointed on Thursday to the floods in Spain as a reminder of the self-harming effects of humans' destruction of nature, urging delegates at a deadlocked UN biodiversity conference in Colombia to "act."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European Commission envoy Florika Fink-Hooijer said the "catastrophe" in the Valencia region highlighted the link between biodiversity loss and human-caused climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worsening droughts and flooding cause the loss of plant species such as trees -- which serve as a bulwark against some of the worst effects of global warming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we act on biodiversity, we at least can buffer some of the climate impacts," Fink-Hooijer said at a press conference in the city of Cali, host of the 16th Conference of Parties (COP16) to the UN's Convention on Biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this COP we really have a chance to act," said the envoy, who is also the European Commission director-general for environment. (AFP)

    Hong Kong to relaunch Islamic finance drive: Paul Chan
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is ready to relaunch its drive to develop Islamic finance, after a three-day trip to the Saudi capital Riyadh opened his eyes to the untapped potential of developing more financial products that comply with Islamic law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the visit, the Hong Kong delegation led by the finance chief signed 10 memoranda of understanding to further cooperation between the two sides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreements covered areas from mutual investment to collaborations in technology and innovation development, while a local tech firm signed on to launch insurance products with two Saudi companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters on Thursday to conclude his visit, Chan said his exchanges made it apparent that Saudi Arabia is more interested in the Hong Kong, mainland and Asian markets than he had previously thought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told reporters that he came to understand that the kingdom wants to attract different sources of funding to support its infrastructure and industrial development, and hence there’s a demand for diverse forms of financing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously, we thought that market demand for Islamic finance wasn't that high. But after talking to them, we think we'll relaunch Islamic finance soon," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They have to do a lot of infrastructure work. During our exchanges with them, we discussed Islamic finance, as well as using funds raised from issuing green and sustainable bonds in the Hong Kong bond market to support them."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islamic finance involves business transactions that are in full compliance with Islamic law – and which prohibits any involvement with, for example, gambling, alcohol and pork, while interest payments are also banned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The finance minister also revealed that the Future Investment Initiative, or FII Institute, is eager to stage the FII Priority Summit in Hong Kong again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He pointed out that Saudi Arabia is very interested in research and development of technologies, and welcomes SAR companies to set up shop in the kingdom.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saudi Arabia found that it is worth taking reference to Hong Kong's way of nurturing start-ups and talent, according to Chan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They think that our way of nurturing talent through two parks and offering funds to support them, or even the tailor-made listing regime that allows start-ups without profits and income to be listed, is very worth taking reference to."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for nurturing talent, their insurance authority recently went to Hong Kong for an exchange with the local authority. They want to send someone to Hong Kong on secondment, so as to introduce some of our practice to the country. I think this is a good thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also said there was no need to adjust Hong Kong’s full-year economic growth forecast, even though the city’s third quarter growth has slowed to 1.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During the announcement of the Financial Budget at the beginning of this year, we expected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent. I think that the growth could still be within this range. Therefore there's no need to adjust it," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the government will remain both cautious and optimistic.

    Yao Ming steps down as Chinese basketball chief

  <div class="itemFullText">
   NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

    Boeing sweetens offer for striking workers

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US aviation giant Boeing has improved the conditions in its contract offer to thousands of striking workers, with a 38 percent wage increase over four years and a ratification bonus, their union said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, which represents more than 33,000 workers who went on strike on September 13 in the Seattle area, has endorsed the contract, and scheduled a vote on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Your union is endorsing and recommending the latest IAM/Boeing contract proposal. It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory," the IAM chapter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Members overwhelmingly rejected an offer of a 25 percent raise over four years on September 12. A second offer, which promised a 35 percent pay rise, was rejected by nearly two-thirds of members last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The union has consistently asked for a 40 percent salary increase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success," the union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beyond the 38 percent wage increase, members will be entitled to a US$12,000 ratification bonus, up from US$7,000 in the previous offer, Boeing said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4," Boeing said in a statement. (AFP)

   Leading MotoGP riders called Thursday for the season finale in a fortnight to be moved out of Valencia because of deadly once-in-a-generation flooding in Spain.

   <br/>
   At least 95 people have been killed and troops, police and firefighters are racing to find survivors and victims in the Valencia region of the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MotoGP world title could go down to the final race weekend of the campaign, scheduled for the Circuit Ricardo Tormo just outside Valencia on November 16-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Spain's Jorge Martín, who tops the championship ahead of Italy's title-holder Francesco Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Sepang ahead of this weekend's Malaysia GP, the 26-year-old called on the sport's bosses to make a decision on a possible change of venue as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The best thing would be to know right now so you approach the weekend in a different way," said the Pramac Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Title rival Bagnaia, who is still in the fight just 17 points back, said the Spanish people "are living their worst dream".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct – this could be wrong to race there. If it was my choice, I'd prefer not to race there. We have many other options," said the Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Valencia track itself has not been damaged but there are question marks about some of the other infrastructure needed to host thousands of fans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Márquez said the priority must be the recovery effort and not racing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Up to a year's rain fell in a few hours on the eastern city of Valencia and the surrounding region on Tuesday, sending torrents of water and mud through towns and cities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a Spaniard, it's super-difficult to see these kinds of images," said Márquez. "Theorically, we have a GP there – but now I think all the facilities of the government, of Spain, need to go to the people who lost their houses."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain on Thursday started three days of mourning. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number two Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the Paris Masters by 18th-ranked Ugo Humbert of France who swept to a third round victory in three sets on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Left-handed Humbert came through 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 to register his first win over the French Open and Wimbledon champion having lost twice to the Spanish star earlier in 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a testing evening for Alcaraz who was 0-5 down in the first set before he managed to get on the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just super proud of myself that I did it," said Humbert who has won titles in Marseille and Dubai this season. "It was a crazy match, a crazy atmosphere."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went for every shot," added Humbert, looking back on his first set blitz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's why I think I had less energy in the second set, and after the third it was a mountain that was with me to the end," he said. "I trusted myself in big moments and I made some big shots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Alcaraz has endured a rollercoaster second half of the season since his heartbreaking Paris Olympics final loss to Novak Djokovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a very intense match," admitted Alcaraz. "I started with some doubts about my game. Against a player who attacks whenever he can, who hits very aggressively at the slightest opportunity, it wasn't easy to get into the match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was not up to the level he displayed," he added. "Ugo's performance was really high – the way he hits the ball is incredible."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcraz was knocked out in the second round of the US Open by 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, and defeated top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the Beijing final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He then suffered a quarter-final exit at the hands of Tomas Machac, the world number 33, at the Shanghai Masters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Humbert goes on to face Australia's Jordan Thompson for a place in the Paris Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French number one just edged Alcaraz in winners on Thursday with 28 to 23 with both men committing 38 unforced errors. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Major US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday after Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks also slipped. Amazon and Apple dropped ahead of their quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet, which reported on Tuesday, also fell.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You had three of the Magnificent Seven all say they basically have open-ended budgets for AI spend and investors don't like to hear that," said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The intermediate and longer-term implications of this buildout are really important for US long-term growth and long-term productivity. ... In the short run, investors are asking where's the profit from it?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Microsoft and Meta both said their capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could reduce profitability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow fell 0.9 percent, to finish at 41,763. The S&P lost 1.9 percent, to 5,705, and the Nasdaq fell 2.8 percent, to 18,095.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2 percent in September, in line with economists' expectations. However, the core figure was 2.7 percent year-over-year, slightly above the 2.6 percent forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 25-basis-point rate reduction in the Fed's November meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We do expect them to cut by a quarter (percentage point) next week because there is nothing in the data this week that should throw them off of that," Schleif said. (Reuters)

    Brussels launches investigation into Temu

  <img alt="The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777069_1_20241031192419.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The EU launched a formal investigation on Thursday into Chinese-founded e-commerce platform Temu on suspicion the site is doing too little to stop the sale of illegal products, in a probe that could lead to large fines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Extremely popular in the European Union despite having entered the continent's market only last year, Temu has on average around 92 million monthly active users in the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The investigation will also look at dangers from the platform's "potentially addictive design" that could have "negative consequences" on users' "physical and mental well-being," said the European Commission, the EU's powerful digital watchdog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The probe is being launched under a mammoth law known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) that forces the world's largest tech firms to do more to protect European consumers online.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We want to ensure that Temu is complying with the Digital Services Act. Particularly in ensuring that products sold on their platform meet EU standards and do not harm consumers," EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU wants to know more about the systems Temu has in place to "limit the sale" of illegal products as well as how the platform restricts their "reappearance".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to explain what measures it is taking to address any risks from its service, including game-like reward programmes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu said it would cooperate with the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Temu takes its obligations under the DSA seriously, continuously investing to strengthen our compliance system and safeguard consumer interests on our platform," a Temu spokesperson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will cooperate fully with regulators to support our shared goal of a safe, trusted marketplace for consumers," the spokesperson said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU probe will also look at Temu's systems and how they recommend content and products to users as well as whether the platform is complying with the obligation to give researchers access to Temu's publicly available data, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu will also have to provide more details about the "parameters" of its recommender systems, which are used by platforms to push more personalised content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU stressed that the "opening of formal proceedings does not prejudge its outcome" and there is no deadline for the probe's completion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Temu is among 25 "very large" online platforms that must comply with the DSA or risk fines that could reach as high as six percent of their global turnover, or even a ban for serious and repeated violations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other shopping platforms that must comply with the DSA include Chinese online retailer AliExpress, US giant Amazon and Chinese-founded Shein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other DSA investigations have targeted AliExpress, social media platform X, which is owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk and used to be called Twitter, as well as Facebook and Instagram owned by Meta. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by eight percent in 2023 but the cuts being made are falling short of EU targets, the European Environment Agency (EEA) reported on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following this "largest year-on-year reduction in several decades," emissions were now 37 percent below 1990 levels, the EEA said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The huge drop was led by a significant decline in coal use and growth of renewable energy sources and supported by reduced energy consumption across Europe," said an agency statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The share of renewable energy in Europe's energy consumption has risen from 10.2 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2023, the agency said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Based on existing measures, projections signal a 43 percent reduction in net emissions in EU countries by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, falling short of the 55 percent target set by the EU, the agency warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that "22 member states have submitted additional projections that include planned but not yet launched measures."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Together, these would reduce net emissions in the EU by 49 percent below 1990 levels in 2030," the EEA said, coming closer but still falling short of the target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "To close the remaining gap by 2030, it is essential that emissions reductions continue at a swift pace over the coming years," the EEA said. (AFP)

   The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Xia Baolong has met Polytechnic University Council Chairman Lam Tai-fai and its President Teng Jin-guang in Beijing.

   Xia told them that the SAR’s universities have a long history, boast a glorious tradition, have a good international reputation and are valuable resources for the nation’s higher education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He pointed out that Hong Kong’s major universities shoulder the important mission of fostering virtues, adding they should not only devote themselves to this mission, but should also give firm support to the Chief Executive and the SAR government, and together work to level up higher education in the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xia fully affirmed the work of the PolyU, saying it has pulled together in recent years and achieved excellent results in areas such as research and innovation, and had contributed to major national projects.

   He also said central authorities firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in developing the education sector in accordance with the “One Country, Two Systems” principle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xia expressed the hope that all tertiary institutions in the SAR will focus on the needs of the country and the strengths of Hong Kong and harness the strength of the “One Country Two Systems” principle to keep up with the times and strive to foster talented people to help realise national rejuvenation.

   Police on Thursday said they laid a holding charge against a 34-year-old foreign man with one count of murder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man was arrested on Tuesday following the death of a 25-year-old foreign woman on Monday in Aberdeen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case will be mentioned at Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police had also arrested a 36-year-old local woman in connection with the case. She was released on bail and is required to report back to officers in late November.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation has conducted its first dual aircraft carrier formation exercise in the South China Sea, state media said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Broadcaster CCTV said the drills involving the Liaoning and Shandong that took place "in an area of the South China Sea" intended to "hone and enhance the combat capability of the aircraft carrier formation system”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a post accompanied by a video of jets taking off from and landing on the two carriers, CCTV said the exercises also took place in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Xinhua News Agency said the drills “featured multiple subjects under real-combat circumstances”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reports did not specify when the exercises took place, though they said the broader naval mission had overlapped with public holidays that spanned late September to October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, having been commissioned in 2012. The Shandong entered service in 2019, while a third carrier, the Fujian, is undergoing sea trials. (Additional reporting by AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's economy grew by 1.8 percent in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Growth was slower than the previous two quarters – the second quarter saw a 3.2 percent expansion and first quarter GDP grew by 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the government said growth in exports was down, while private consumption expenditure continued to decline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said the local economy will continue to grow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While global economic uncertainties and trade conflicts may affect Hong Kong's exports of goods, monetary easing across major central banks and an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures would help support sentiment and activities in the domestic market," the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government had projected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Samuel Tse, an economist at DBS Bank, said he expects the economy to improve in the fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the economy hasn't been doing well in the past few quarters. But I think for the fourth quarter, it will be doing a little bit better, given the interest rate cut cycle from the Fed (US Federal Reserve) has already commenced. Mainland China has also started their stimulus packages," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, these will be translating into some positive effects onto the consumption as well as the investment."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Beijing on Thursday said it was "concerned" over the situation on the Korean Peninsula, after Pyongyang said it had test-fired one of its most powerful missiles to boost its nuclear deterrent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch was North Korea's first weapons test since being accused of sending soldiers to Russia, with South Korea's military saying that its "initial judgement" was that the projectile may have been a "new solid-propelled long-range ballistic missile".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it was "concerned about developments on the [Korean] peninsula".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China... has consistently maintained that preserving peace and stability on the peninsula and promoting the process of political resolution to the peninsula issue aligns with the common interests of all parties," ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope all parties will make efforts toward this goal," he told a regular press briefing in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch came hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, warning that North Korean soldiers in Russian uniforms were being deployed for possible action against Ukraine. (AFP)

    'New medical school can reference the US system'

   Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said Hong Kong’s planned third medical school could be modelled on the American system and focus on admitting students with bachelor’s degrees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the administration would support local universities in establishing a third medical school in the SAR to increase doctor numbers. Authorities would also reserve a site in the Northern Metropolis for the facility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Lo said the new medical school should be innovative in its operations, including on funding and admissions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the institution could reference the American medical school curriculum, which usually lasts for four years and admits those with an undergraduate degree.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This would give us another avenue for admission, because some students were initially undecided about whether they wanted to become a doctor. They might study for a degree first, before realising they really wanted to study medicine. There are other benefits too, such as the students being more mature," Lo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief also said there should be a minimum number of students when the new medical school opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The number of students cannot be too low, or else it will not be cost-effective... Normally speaking, a medical school of the smallest scale would have 50 students as a starting point," Lo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added the new institution and a hospital for teaching and research in Ngau Tam Mei, a rural village in Yuen Long, could possibly cover 2.5 million people in the new development area.

    Labour reps urge action over worker exploitation

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Worker representatives on Thursday met the labour secretary, who they said promised to take steps to stop the exploitation of migrant employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland employees seeking work in Hong Kong under various labour importation schemes must apply through authorised agents, which reportedly charge them fees that can add up to tens of thousands of dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following a meeting with Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, an employee representative on the Labour Advisory Board, Lam Wai-kong, said the minister had promised to take legal and administrative steps to tackle the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Actually the secretary didn’t specify what the legal and administrative steps would be. But from my own understanding,  the salary for the import workers should be based on the median salary of local workers. If they are not paid correctly that means the agents have broken the law,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “As for administrative steps, in the vetting process for individual labour import applications, I believe the Labour and Welfare Bureau has the ability to make changes to decide whether each case gets approved or not.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that Sun had also agreed to review labour importation schemes sooner, instead of waiting every two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, another representative on the board, Jenny Tam, said they are also worried about the government’s plan to bring in 10,000 skilled workers aged 35 or under over the next three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The secretary had cited the shortage of A-Grade electricians as an example. But we think there are actually enough workers in this field, with many holding licences. We are worried that importing more workers could affect local employment,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that Sun responded by saying officials will be prudent and listen to different views.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Snooker superstar Ronnie O’Sullivan has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Department said on social media on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as the Rocket for his fast and attacking playing style, said he enjoyed his time in the SAR in the past and his sport is very popular in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan also said it’s a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My plan in Hong Kong is, obviously, here to do some work. But I love the food. I love to just, relax here in Hong Kong," he said in a video clip on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Maybe I'm going to play some snooker, just see some friends maybe. It's just really nice to be back in Hong Kong again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan, currently ranked fifth in the world, won the Hong Kong Snooker Masters two years ago, saying at the time that he enjoyed the hiking trails in the city.

   His decision to obtain Hong Kong residency comes after a similar move last year by retired basketball star Stephon Marbury, whose playing career spanned over two decades in the National Basketball Association in the US and the Chinese Basketball Association.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Thursday said they have developed a new AI medical model that answers questions like ChatGPT.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chatbot is one of four new AI models unveiled by the university which can diagnose up to 30 types of cancers and diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Professor Chen Hao, who led the project, said the "MedDr" model can generate reports and provide initial diagnoses based on medical images.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Users can send close-up images and the chatbot will then analyse what is wrong and offer treatment suggestions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it can save a lot of time spent on doctor's appointments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We hope to actually see 30 to 40 percent [reduction in time]. Some doctors are very interested in using this in the waiting room, because the patients spend a lot of time in the waiting room but when they see a doctor it’s just actually a few minutes,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We wanted to actually leverage this multimodal language model to let the patients ask the questions and then you have a summary and then doctors will quickly actually see the summary and understand the background of the patients.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chen added that the university will work with local hospitals and consult more medical practitioners to ensure the tool's accuracy.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Los Angeles Dodgers produced a stunning fightback to defeat the New York Yankees and clinch the World Series on Wednesday with a dramatic come-from-behind 7-6 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a night of spellbinding drama at Yankee Stadium, the Dodgers sealed their second Major League Baseball championship crown in five seasons and eighth overall after recovering from 5-0 down to complete a 4-1 series victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, who had kept the series alive with an 11-4 rout in game four on Tuesday, had looked poised to take the series back to Los Angeles for game six after home runs from Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees starter Gerrit Cole meanwhile produced a masterful performance from the mound to keep the Dodgers' potent offensive line-up scoreless through four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a catastrophic fifth inning by the Yankees, which included a litany of defensive errors, saw the Dodgers pile on five unearned runs to tie the score at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Yankees regained the lead through a Stanton sacrifice-fly in the sixth inning, the Dodgers hit back in the eighth with sac-flys of their own from Gavin Lux and Mookie Betts to claim what turned out to be a winning 7-6 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers then brought back game three starter Walker Buehler to bag the final three outs in the ninth to clinch victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously we're resilient, but there's so much love in this clubhouse, care – that care won this game today," said Dodgers star Betts. "That's what it was. It was love, it was grit – it was just a beautiful thing and I'm just proud of us and I'm happy for us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Buehler, meanwhile, admitted he had not been expecting to play a part in the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wish I was in a little better shape so my heart could have handled it better," the Dodgers pitcher said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers star Freddie Freeman, who blasted four consecutive home runs in the opening four games of the series, was named Series Most Valuable Player.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we were all saying the first three innings – 'let's just get one, just chip away, we can do this,'" said Freeman, who drove in two runs in the fifth inning rally with a single. "There's a couple of mistakes that happened, you've got to capitalise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers had gone into Wednesday's game quietly confident, with victorious game one starter Jack Flaherty back on the mound.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Flaherty's eve-of-Halloween outing turned into a horror show as the revived Yankees bats cut loose to leave the Dodgers reeling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and then Chisholm followed it with a solo shot to put the Yankees 3-0 ahead, before Alex Verdugo drove in a run for Anthony Volpe to make it 4-0 in the second, prompting Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to remove Flaherty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stanton's third inning solo home run made it a five-run game but after that dream start, the wheels fell off in the fifth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enrique Hernandez launched the Dodgers rally with a single to lead off the inning and then Tommy Edman was given a reprieve when Judge flubbed a catch in center-field that left the Dodgers with two men on base and no outs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a terrible mix-up between Cole and first baseman Anthony Rizzo allowed Betts to single and score Hernandez to make it 5-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman then took full advantage, doubling to score Edman and Will Smith to make it 5-3 with runners on first and third. Teoscar Hernandez then drove a double to center-field to bring in two more runs and the game was suddenly tied at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Dodgers conjured another rally, with Lux and Betts bagging sac-flys to snatch a one-run lead at 7-6, leaving Buehler to close out victory in the ninth. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Up to 20 students per year are to be given scholarships to study postgraduate courses at the University of Cambridge, under an initiative launched by the world-renowned British institution and City University of Hong Kong (CityU).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The funding, totalling HK$10 million per year, will enable the students to do a one-year, full-time master's programme at Lucy Cavendish College, one of the largest constituent colleges of Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The aim is to have our students, graduates going for this course, to stay at Lucy Cavendish [College] and become a graduate for the world," said CityU president Freddy Boey on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This programme does not require them to come back to Hong Kong, but I'm pretty sure, as graduate alumni of this special programme, they will do us proud anywhere in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The programme, which will initially run for five years, will also accept applications from other students if the slots are not filled up by CityU graduates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Madeleine Atkins, president of Lucy Cavendish College, said graduates of all disciplines are welcome, adding that Hong Kong students are "highly competitive candidates" for master's courses at Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We take students from across all the master's programmes at Cambridge, because we believe that many of the problems in this world require interdisciplinary solutions. By living and learning together on this programme, students from different academic backgrounds do benefit from the experience of working closely on projects and teams with those from other disciplines," said Atkins.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   CityU has also partnered with the British college for the Future Global Leaders Programme, which equips students with skills to address pressing global issues.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bar owners can expect Halloween to bring them at least a 10 percent boost in business, industry representatives said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman said the build up to Halloween this year has been the best to date, with people heading out to celebrate since last Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This year especially, what the restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong are doing, one's doing a hell's wedding theme, with Halloween menus. Another one's got cult class zombie movies with a big banquet. Every restaurant's doing dress-up parties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zeman said he believes business will surge by 10 to 25 percent, adding that restaurants in the area are almost fully booked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been packed. I think tonight will be very very busy, and I am not even sure it will go until tomorrow or even Sunday. But it's totally different. It's not a one-day holiday now, this year especially they started early... I was surprised, totally surprised along with everyone else."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chin Chun-wing who chairs the Hong Kong Bar and Club Association said he is anticipating a minimum 10 percent growth in business over the next two nights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Halloween isn't a thing on the mainland. Therefore we see a lot of mainlanders coming to Hong Kong to really experience the vibes, as well as take photos with revellers," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many people put on Halloween make-up. You can see that this year, there were a lot more youths of around 20 years old, all of them put on heavy make-up to enjoy the festival."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday spent a second day in Riyadh promoting business opportunities for Hong Kong in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a delegation of more than 110 people on a three-day trip to the Saudi capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following the morning listing ceremony for the first exchange-traded fund in Saudi Arabia that invests in Hong Kong stocks on the Saudi Exchange, Chan met with Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Chang Hua, at noon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan updated the ambassador on Hong Kong's economy while the pair talked about cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial secretary then co-hosted a roundtable with the chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz, in which representatives from regulatory bodies and various asset management firms gathered to discuss recent developments in financial markets.

   Chan later met with the Governor of the Saudi Central Bank, Ayman Alsayari, and pair discussed strengthening ties in investment and financial markets between Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, along with cooperation in digital finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the evening, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks held an event featuring over 20 startups in fields like green tech and AI, hoping to connect with investors and business partners.

   <br/>
   Chan will wrap up his visit today and is expected to arrive back in Hong Kong at around noon on Friday.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   It was a homecoming for Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James on Wednesday, as his son Bronny secured his first-ever NBA career bucket in their team's 134-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the 39-year-old Lakers superstar watched from the bench, Bronny James scored his first points in an NBA game on a shot that looked just like his old man.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second game featuring a father-son duo, LeBron checked out in the fourth quarter and sat back to enjoy seeing his son soak in the love of a Cleveland crowd that cheered his every move for 11 seasons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the Cavs on their way to the blowout victory, Cleveland fans began chanting “We want Bronny!”, hoping to see the rookie they watched grow up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The younger James checked in with 5:16 left and was cheered every time he touched the ball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He picked up two assists and then made his first basket as a pro on a 14-foot shot from the left corner with 2:03 left, triggering a huge ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland took control with a red-hot first quarter, connecting on 77.3 percent of their shots from the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Cavs led by 19 at halftime and turnovers doomed the Lakers' efforts to make significant inroads in the third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James led the Lakers with 26 points. Anthony Davis added 22 with 13 rebounds but Los Angeles dropped their second straight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lakers head coach J.J. Redick had high praise for Bronny despite the loss.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I told him congratulations,” he said. “It's a big deal to score your first NBA points, and the fact he did it back here in Cleveland was a bright spot.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When Bronny was little, he ran through the hallways, rode the elevators and took shots or played pickup on the practice court inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse – all while his famous father played in games for the Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in the day, Bronny reflected on his Ohio homecoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s going to be real special,” he said following the morning shootaround. “It feels good to be out here with my dad – in our home.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron spent 11 seasons over two stints with the Cavs, leading them to the 2016 title before leaving as a free agent two years later. Last week, the 39-year-old superstar and his 20-year-old son became the first father-son duo to play in an NBA game. (AP/AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two New York Yankees fans who interfered with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts as he tried to make a catch were barred from Wednesday's fifth game of the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees announced hours before the crucial clash in New York that the spectators, who were seated in the from row along the wall in foul territory in right field, were ejected after trying to block the player and take the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened in the first inning of New York's 11-4 victory, which lifted the Yankees within 3-1 in Major League Baseball's best-of-seven championship showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Last night, two fans were ejected from Yankee Stadium for egregious and unacceptable physical contact with Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts," the Yankees said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The safety and security of players, fans and stadium staff is the foundational element of every event held at Yankee Stadium," it added. "It cannot be compromised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however the exuberance of supporting one's team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk," the statement went on to say.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Yankees and Major League Baseball maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of behavior displayed last night – these fans will not be permitted to attend tonight's game in any capacity."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts tried to make a grab off a ball hit by New York's Gleyber Torres but as he leaped above the wall in foul territory, one fan grabbed his right hand and the other pulled the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Torres was called out due to fan interference on the play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've never seen anything like it," said Dodgers starting pitcher Ben Casparius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That looked ridiculous from my perspective," Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman said. "The guy was trying to yank his glove off, pulling at his wrist. Looked like he got ejected and I'm glad he did. I've never seen anything like that – that was unacceptable." (AFP)

    Medvedev loses to Australian Popyrin at Paris Masters

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Daniil Medvedev is still searching for his first ATP tournament victory this year after the world number five lost to Australia's Alexei Popyrin for the first time in his career at the Paris Masters on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev won the Paris title in 2020 but has not found the indoor tournament to his liking in recent years – the defeat to Popyrin is the third successive time he has gone out in his opening round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin, who has been on a rich vein of form this year winning his first Masters tournament in Montreal in August and beating Novak Djokovic in the US Open, edged Medvedev 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a gripping second round match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Popyrin, ranked 24 in the world, it was only his third win over a player in the top five.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is the first time I have beaten him," said Popyrin. "We have had some right old battles in the past and it is a real pleasure to have performed like this this time round."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin will next play Karen Khachanov after the Russian downed France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (12/14), 6-1, 6-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev, who has already qualified for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals next month, fought back twice in the deciding set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He came back from 4-1 down to force a tie-break and then trailing 4-1 in that he levelled at 4-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, with Popyrin leading 5-4, Medvedev double-faulted giving the 25-year-old Australian two match points and he wasted no time in sealing the victory on the first one. (AFP)

    N Korea fires 'long-range' ballistic missile: Seoul

  <img alt="The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776947_1_20241031075514.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea on Thursday fired a "long-range ballistic missile", South Korea's military said, Pyongyang's first weapons test since Seoul accused it of sending tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea's military had warned a day earlier that the nuclear-armed North was preparing to test another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or even conduct a nuclear test, possibly ahead of next week's US elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military detected one ballistic missile launched from the Pyongyang area toward the East Sea at approximately 7:10 AM (2210 GMT) today," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The ballistic missile is presumed to be a long-range missile launched at a high angle," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea typically test-fires its longest-range and most powerful missiles on a so-called lofted trajectory – fired up, not out – which it says is to avoid overflying neighbouring countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military has heightened its alert level and is closely sharing information regarding North Korea's ballistic missile with the US and Japan authorities, maintaining a thorough readiness posture," Seoul's JCS added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo also confirmed a possible launch, with Japan's coastguard reporting an "object potentially a ballistic missile launched from North Korea" and warning vessels to take care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, where Washington says some 10,000 have been deployed for possible action against Ukrainian forces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The defence chiefs of South Korea and the United States condemned North Korea's troop deployment to Russia in the "strongest" terms at the allies' annual defence talks at the Pentagon on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has previously said the nuclear-armed North's accelerating deployment posed a "significant security threat," with the military telling lawmakers on Wednesday that thousands of troops had been moved to western Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The fact that such a large number of personnel has moved westward suggests they are unlikely to have gone merely for observation," a presidential official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en mass in the wake of Kim Jong-un's signing of a mutual defence deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has denied sending troops, but in the first comment in state media last week, its vice foreign minister said that if such a deployment to happen, it would be in line with international law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang is banned from tests using ballistic technology by multiple rounds of UN sanctions, but Kim Jong-un has ramped up testing this year, with experts warning he could be testing weaponry before providing it to Russia. (AFP)

    UK to raise taxes by 40 billion pounds annually

  <img alt="Rachel Reeves announces a string of tax increases, as she seeks to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776929_1_20241031012156.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's new finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget on Wednesday, accusing the former Conservative government of breaking the country's public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and the wealthy were set to bear the brunt of the tax hikes, and Reeves also paved the way for higher borrowing for investment to speed up Britain's economy, which has been slowed by the 2007-09 global financial crisis, Brexit, Covid and soaring energy prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Bank of England economist – who said she was proud to be the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer – stressed there would be no repeat of how former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss sent the bond market into a tailspin in 2022 with her unfunded tax cut plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial reaction to her speech suggested investors were unfazed by the Labour Party's first economic programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But government prices fell later as the scale of the planned spending became apparent and investors scaled back their bets on Bank of England interest rate cuts next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said she would raise taxes by 40 billion pounds (US$52 billion) a year, blaming the Conservatives for leaving her Labour Party with a budget "black hole".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any responsible Chancellor would take action," she said. "That is why today, I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services." She painted a grim picture of Britain, with record waiting times in the health service, children studying in crumbling schools and dysfunctional transport and justice systems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, tax hikes of 40 billion pounds would be equivalent to 1.25 percent of economic output, surpassed in recent history only in 1993 by a budget plan under the Conservatives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Keir Starmer had warned "those with the broadest shoulders" would have to pay more to spare "working people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on 10-year British government bonds – which moves in the opposite direction to prices – was up by around four basis points on the day at 1600 GMT, having fallen sharply during Reeves' speech earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors were pricing in fewer interest rate cuts by the BoE given the scale of government spending with four quarter-point reductions expected in 2025 compared with about five earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves announced a string of tax increases, saying "difficult decisions cannot be constantly delayed or deferred" as she sought to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate of social security contributions paid by employers will rise by 1.2 percentage points to 15 percent from April, and a threshold at which firms start to pay it will come down, raising an extra 25 billion pounds a year in five years' time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other revenue-raising moves included changes to taxes on capital gains and inheritances and tax paid by private equity executives, non-domiciled residents and users of private jets and private schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Reeves unexpectedly ruled out making more individuals pay basic and higher income tax rates after a freeze on the threshold for payments expires in the 2028/29 tax year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also extended a freeze on fuel duty and cut a tax on draught beer in pubs, measures that could help to reverse a fall in support for Starmer's fledgling government in opinion polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another significant move, Reeves said she would change a second fiscal rule to allow for more borrowing, paving the way for 100 billion pounds in investment over the next five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said the government will now target a fall in public sector net financial liabilities as a share of the economy, rather than public sector net debt excluding the BoE. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed lower on Wednesday despite positive US economic data, as investors assessed company earnings including reports after the bell by major tech names Facebook-parent Meta and Microsoft.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones retreated 0.2 percent to 42,141, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.3 percent to 5,813.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq lost 0.6 percent to 18,607.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The market appears to be searching for a "next catalyst" to determine if it can keep moving higher, said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For now, he added, "Alphabet is doing very well on the back of its earnings report. But at the same time, you have some other earnings results that were not received quite as well."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed 2.9 percent higher, a day after it reported solid third quarter results with revenue climbing 15 percent from a year ago to US$88.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But other companies saw their share prices drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares in Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, lost 2.1 percent as it reported a drop in sales and lowered its revenue outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.6 percent although its results came in slightly above expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In after-hours trading, Meta shares fell more than two percent shortly after reporting profits that surpassed market expectations, while Microsoft gained 0.8 percent on strong growth in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The performance of Wall Street came despite the US economy expanding 2.8 percent in the third quarter according to government data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was a solid figure although a slight slowdown from the previous quarter. Data from payroll firm ADP also showed private sector hiring surged more than expected. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buried with a padlock on her foot and an iron sickle across her neck, "Zosia" was never supposed to be able to come back from the dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Entombed in an unmarked cemetery in Pien, northern Poland, the young woman was one of dozens feared by her neighbours to have been a "vampire".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Now, using DNA, 3D printing and modelling clay, a team of scientists has reconstructed Zosia's 400-year-old face, revealing the human story buried by supernatural beliefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's really ironic, in a way," said Swedish archaeologist Oscar Nilsson. "These people burying her, they did everything they could in order to prevent her from coming back from the dead... we have done everything we can in order to bring her back to life."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia, as she was named by locals, was found in 2022 by a team of archaeologists from Torun's Nicolaus Copernicus University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aged 18-20 when she died, analysis of Zosia's skull suggests she suffered from a health condition which would have caused fainting and severe headaches, as well as possible mental health issues, Nilsson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sickle, the padlock and certain types of wood found at the grave site were all believed at the time to hold magical properties protecting against vampires, according to the Nicolaus Copernicus team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia's was Grave No. 75 at the unmarked cemetery in Pien, outside the northern city of Bydgoszcz. Among the other bodies found at the site was a "vampire" child, buried face down and similarly padlocked at the foot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Little is known of Zosia's life, but Nilsson and the Pien team say items she was buried with point to her being from a wealthy — possibly noble — family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 17th century Europe she lived in was ravaged by war, something Nilsson suggests created a climate of fear in which belief in supernatural monsters was commonplace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson's recreation began with creating a 3D printed replica of the skull, before gradually building layers of plasticine clay "muscle by muscle" to form a life-like face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He uses bone structure combined with information on gender, age, ethnicity and approximate weight to estimate the depth of facial features.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's emotional to watch a face coming back from the dead, especially when you know the story about this young girl," Nilsson says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson said he wanted to bring Zosia back "as a human, and not as this monster that she is buried as". (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain braced for a heavier human toll after at least 95 people died in flash floods that launched muddy waters through towns, tossed cars and wreaked transport havoc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescuers were expected to find more bodies in the European country's deadliest flood in more than 50 years and three days of official mourning were due to start on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Television pictures from the town of Utiel showed rescuers using dinghies worked in the dark to scour the floodwaters and taking several people to safety. Emergency services were still working to reach the worst-hit areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For those who at this moment are still looking for their loved ones, the whole of Spain weeps with you," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address, vowing to "rebuild your streets, your squares, your bridges".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus production in the world's top orange supplier, said some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If (emergency services) have not arrived, it's not due to a lack of means or predisposition, but a problem of access," Mazon told a press conference, adding that reaching certain areas was "absolutely impossible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 62 people died in Valencia, while authorities in the central region of Castilla La Mancha said the storm had left two people dead and several missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Footage showed rescue workers carrying several women in a bulldozer's bucket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains to the cities of Madrid and Barcelona were cancelled due to the flooding, and schools and other essential services were suspended in the worst-hit areas, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency services in the region urged citizens to avoid all road travel and to follow further official advice, and a military unit specialised in rescue operations was deployed in some places to help local emergency workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some parts of the region such as the towns of Turis, Chiva or Bunol recorded more than 400 millimetres of rainfall - equivalent to a year of normal rainfall - leading the state weather agency AEMET to declare a red alert on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As rain eased there, the alert was lowered to amber, but with the storm moving in a northeasterly direction, the regional weather service in Catalonia issued a red alert for the area around Barcelona, warning of high winds and hail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. (Agencies)

    'Give Choi Hung Estate residents more housing options'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Lawmaker Bill Tang on Wednesday urged the government to offer more options to residents of Choi Hung Estate who need to be rehoused in the first phase of a massive redevelopment plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities say 2,450 flats at the new Mei Tung Estate in Wong Tai Sin will be available to house the first batch of residents affected when construction starts in 2028, and they can also consider buying a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, says authorities should also allow affected residents to move into any empty flats available in other parts of Choi Hung Estate that will only be redeveloped in 2035 or later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents who live in the first phase… they know they need to move out, but they really want to stay in Choi Hung. We suggest there should be diverse options for the phase one residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmaker also noted that volunteers will need to be recruited to assist elderly families that will have to relocate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang also expressed concerns that the current timetable for the entire redevelopment project spans two decades from 2028 to 2048, saying buildings will be so old by the end they may be unsafe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents living in Choi Hung [Estate] must live with a construction site for over 20 years,” he said. “The first building will be removed and then rebuilt and from the first building to the last building, it will be over 20 years. That means the last building will be removed maybe at the age of 80 years old," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Choi Hung resident Tsang said while the current arrangements aren’t perfect, he’s planning to move to Mei Tung Estate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm somewhat satisfied but transportation is not as convenient as Choi Hung. You have to walk quite a bit either to Lok Fu or Wong Tai Sin Station – but what can you do? It's better than nothing and we have a place to settle down," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fellow resident Pang said he will be closing his small shop of 20 years in Choi Hung Estate soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's hard to maintain a small shop in a public housing estate, especially with everyone shopping up north. The spending patterns have changed significantly and the ageing population is increasing," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A woman surnamed Fan meanwhile, said she hopes that authorities could maintain some key elements of Choi Hung Estate – famed for its rainbow colour scheme – as they bring good memories to many people.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

    Choi Hung Estate to be redeveloped in three phases

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Choi Hung Estate will be redeveloped in three phases, with the first batch of affected residents set to be relocated in about four years’ time, according to a paper submitted by housing authorities on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The redevelopment plan’s timeline for the estate built in the 1960s and famous for its rainbow colour theme was unveiled in the paper submitted to the Wong Tai Sin District Council, in which the Housing Department said the first phase would involve three blocks – Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House – as well as two vacant school sites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The new Mei Tung Estate, which is expected to start taking in residents in 2028-29, will provide 2,450 units for the first phase of relocation, accommodating about one-third of the affected Choi Hung Estate residents," the paper said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the area in the first phase is cleared out, construction will begin immediately and it will be able to provide about 3,200 units to residents of four blocks affected by the second stage of redevelopment, expected to take place from 2035-36.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area involved in the second phase will then be able to take care of the last batch of households. These residents will move into some 4,100 newly built units between 2042 and 2043.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The relocation process would take roughly 15 years, the department added, and by 2048, the last phase of the estate is expected to be redeveloped to offer 1,900 flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In total, the new Choi Hung Estate will be able to accommodate 9,200 households, up from the current 7,400.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said the redevelopment would also provide an opportunity to improve traffic conditions at the Choi Hung Interchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Housing Authority has begun discussions with relevant departments to free up part of the Choi Hung Estate site to alleviate traffic congestion in the area,” the paper said.

   The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-19 spaceflight mission have entered the Tiangong space station and met with three others, starting a new round of in-orbit crew handover.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The University of Hong Kong on Wednesday said diabetes patients can lower the risk of getting colorectal and liver cancers, the second and fifth most common in the SAR, by controlling their blood glucose levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Faculty of Medicine conducted two territory-wide analyses using 17 years of Hospital Authority data involving 140,000 diabetes patients.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It found that by controlling blood glucose levels, such patients can lower the chances of getting colorectal cancer by 28 percent, and liver cancer by 30 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cancer cells, when they have a lot of sugar around them, they are able to grow faster. This is in essence the way which patients with diabetes, if it is poorly controlled, they will have an increase risk of both bowel cancer and liver cancer," explained the university's Dr Walter Seto, who led the project.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media briefing, Seto added that those with diabetes are twice as likely to get these cancers compared with healthy individuals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dr Paul Lee, who specialises in endocrinology and diabetes, told RTHK that patients can improve their blood glucose levels through a good diet and more exercise.

  <img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776876_1_20241030170539.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.
