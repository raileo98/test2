<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Underdog Madison Keys upset Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in the Australian Open final on Saturday to win her first Grand Slam crown at the age of 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The American ended world number one Sabalenka's dream of becoming the first woman for 26 years to win a third successive Melbourne Park singles title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys yelled in delight and wiped away tears on securing the title after withstanding a fierce fightback from the Belarusian two-time defending champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, the 2023 and 2024 champion, buried her head in a towel after her 20-match win streak at Melbourne Park was ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 19th-seeded Keys it was the culmination of a 15-year journey from teenage prodigy to major winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have wanted this for so long and I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it did not go my way," said an emotional Keys, whose coach Bjorn Fratangelo is also her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know if I was ever going to get back to this position to try to win a trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm mostly just really proud of myself to get back to this position, to be able to play the way that I played and finish on such a strong note."
  <br>
  <br>
  The American had been tipped as a future world number one after winning her maiden WTA Tour match at the age of 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made her first major semi-final at Melbourne Park 10 years ago as a 19-year-old, but a decade on she can finally call herself a Grand Slam champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made my very first Grand Slam semi-final here in Melbourne," said Keys, the runner-up at the US Open in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to now have won my first Grand Slam in the same place means the absolute world to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team believed in me every step of the way. So thank you so much," added Keys, who will now equal her career-high seventh in the world ranking she attained nine years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They believed in me when I didn't believe in myself and helped me every step of the way. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didn't know if I was gonna be able to do it again." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militants and Israel carried out a hostage-prisoner swap on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire deal, but a last-minute dispute blocked the expected return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to devastated northern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the exchange, the second since the truce took effect last Sunday, four freed Israeli women hostages, all soldiers, arrived home in Israel after more than 15 months of captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel's prison service confirmed that 200 prisoners, whom it called "terrorists", were freed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli captives, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20, and Liri Albag, 19, waved, smiled, and gave thumbs up as they were paraded on a stage in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked and armed militants flanked them during a ceremony watched by hundreds of residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, where a crowd gathered to watch their release on a large TV screen at a plaza known as Hostage Square, there were tears of joy, applause and a loud cheer as Israeli flags waved.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their handover to the Red Cross, Israel's military said the women were transferred back into Israel and "reunited with their parents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Buses carrying the released Palestinians left Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and Ktziot prison in the Negev desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  As dozens of the former prisoners reached the West Bank city of Ramallah, crowds of Palestinians erupted in joy, raising many of them onto their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas’ political bureau had said on Friday that Palestinians displaced by the war to southern Gaza should have been able to begin returning to the north following Saturday's releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel on Saturday said it would block such returns until civilian woman hostage Arbel Yehud is released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said she "was supposed to be released today" but a Hamas source has said Yehud will be "released as part of the third swap set for next Saturday". (AFP)

<img alt="A government spokesperson says that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789115_1_20250125154721.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday condemned lawmakers in the United States again for proposing a bill to review sanctions against certain SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, calling it an attempt to intimidate those safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said in a statement that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states, while accusing US officials of hypocrisy and using double standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the National Security Law has helped restore social stability and improve the business environment after the “black-clad violence” of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, Hong Kong ranks as the world's freest economies among 165 economies. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to fifth globally," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, those US politicians insist on turning a blind eye to all these facts, and even clamour for so-called 'sanctions' against the HKSAR personnel who dutifully safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns their political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said that authorities reject any so-called sanctions and vowed to continue its efforts to safeguard national security, and urged US lawmakers to respect international law and stop interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also affirmed that human rights in Hong Kong are constitutionally protected and that law enforcement actions are conducted based on evidence without regard to political beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the judiciary operates independently, ensuring fair trials and adherence to the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judicial system of the HKSAR has always been highly regarded by international communities. Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Making any statement with the intent to interfere with or obstruct the course of justice, or engaging in conduct with the same intent, is very likely to constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court or the offence of perverting the course of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the government remains committed to implementing the National Security Law and upholding the principle of "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday visited residents in Oi Man Estate ahead of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee greeted those who came out to see him at the housing estate in Ho Man Tin, and shook hands with members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm also here to have a look at the operation of shops. I bought these turnip cakes. I love them and I will share them with my wife. I heard from the shops that business has been good, meeting their expectations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Lee visited the community living room in Hung Hom, and had a meal with people there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, who pointed out that care teams have an important role to play when it comes to assisting residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive visited the residents with a care team, and learnt about how they provide services to people in the community. We did a year-end clean-up and home repairs for the elderly," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added government officials will continue to visit residents, including elderly people, grassroots families and ethnic minorities, at different districts before the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An 88-year-old resident said she was happy that she was able to shake hands with the Chief Executive and that people have high expectations of him.

<img alt='Pete Hegseth has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789114_1_20250125153744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate narrowly confirmed former Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth as Pentagon chief on Friday, despite allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and other fears about his ability to lead the world's most powerful military.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Republican senators voted against Donald Trump's pick as secretary of defense, resulting in a 50-50 tie that required JD Vance to cast the deciding ballot – only the second time in history a vice president has had to intervene to save a cabinet nominee.
  <br>
  <br>
  The razor-edged result underscored concerns about Hegseth, who will take over the Pentagon with war raging in Ukraine, the Middle East volatile despite ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, and as Trump expands the military's role in security on the US-Mexico border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old is a former Army National Guard officer who until recently worked as a co-host for Fox News – one of Trump's favoured television channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has a combative media personality, fierce loyalty and telegenic looks – common hallmarks in Trump's entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters say Hegseth's deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq give him the insight to run the Defense Department better than more experienced officials who would normally be considered for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  In confirming him, Republicans brushed aside his lack of experience leading an organisation anywhere near the size of the Defense Department – the country's largest employer with some three million personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also approved Hegseth despite allegations of financial mismanagement at veterans' nonprofits where he previously worked, reports of excessive drinking, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked during his confirmation hearing last week about criticism he has faced, Hegseth said there was a "coordinated smear campaign" against him, and that he is "not a perfect person, but redemption is real".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has stood by him, telling reporters on Friday: "Pete's a very, very good man."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after he was confirmed, Trump wrote on his Social Truth platform: "Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Train stations and airports across China saw the biggest peak in travellers on Saturday ahead of the Lunar New Year, as millions of people returned home to spend the holidays with their families in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the traditional 40-day period that runs before, during and after eight straight days of public holidays, some nine billion interprovincial passenger trips, on all forms of transport combined, are expected to be made, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Train and air travel are expected to "hit record highs" during this year's migration, Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said it expects 510 million train trips and 90 million air trips during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the national railway company, which has added thousands of trains to meet demand, Saturday is "the main peak" at stations before the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it used data from ticket sales and waiting lists to predict and regulate supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  With many people working and studying in provinces other than their own, there is a large population migration around the New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many factories have already closed for the holiday, with such workers traditionally returning home earlier than the rest of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Immigration Department has estimated that around eight million people will enter and leave Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday. About seven million people are expected to do so through land border control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Year of the Snake, begins on Wednesday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    'Police sparing no effort to fight violent crimes'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said cracking down on triads and violent crimes are some of his top priorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu made the comments following the Police College's passing-out parade, where reporters asked him about two men who were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men outside a Yuen Long industrial building in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one dead and another injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said there were a total of 3,313 assault cases in the first eleven months of last year, down from the same period in the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are focusing on these violent cases, and we will spare no effort. In addition to our intelligence collection to cracking down on their illegal activities, we will also use other means, such as cutting off their financial resources," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also have many intelligence-led operations. In the past, our arrest rate for triad-related crimes was actually close to 40 percent. It is up to us to take the initiative to carry out operations to attack them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu also said that the police adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards any illegal or disciplinary violations and will handle such cases seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the case where police arrested 12 people, including seven officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will definitely deal with any colleague who violates laws and discipline. On the other hand, we have many colleagues. Colleagues who violate laws only account for a very small part of the entire police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we think even one case is too many but I hope everyone understands that we maintain public order and prevent and combat crime in the Hong Kong Police Force. Most of our colleagues work very hard, and our low crime rate today is also the result of our colleagues’ hard work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Siu said the police force is steadily increasing in size, with the number of applications rising by 46 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to the one before.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various measures are being implemented, including a recruitment fast-track process at overseas universities.

    Remaining land sales to top HK$4bn: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Secretary said on Saturday that she's confident that revenues from land sales in the next two months will top HK$4 billion, but the full year figure might still fall short of the government's original projection in last year's budget forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Bernadette Linn noted that a land parcel in Tai Wai had attracted a significant number of bids on Friday. The government has several land sales scheduled between now and the end of the fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the final number will be higher than the number just mentioned, but it may not reach the original estimate of more than HK$30 billion," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that at this time our real estate market hasn't fully recovered, so that's understandable. It takes time for the market to warm up."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the last budget had projected average annual expenditure of about HK$90 billion on public works projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary said work is proceeding on these projects, including the Northern Metropolis project, which she believes can meet existing benchmarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said some Northern Metropolis projects are already under construction, and others have entered the planning process, stressing that these works were huge in scale, and would take years to complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the New Territories North New Town will be carried out in phases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, people often heard about new development areas like the Kwu Tung North New Development Area, which is just a few hundred hectares. The entire San Tin Technopole is about 600 hectares. Thus, the development of over 1,000 hectares has to be carried out in phases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this case, we'll prioritize about 200 hectares within that area. It will include industrial parks, private housing, and part of a university town. We hope to finalize discussions here so we can start the statutory process early and begin construction in 2028."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the authorities will adjust the pace of some projects, to ensure that the government's cash flow is managed effectively, such as waterfront beautification and park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, she noted that the Kau Yi Chau Artifical Islands project has not been abandoned, but time constraints mean it's uncertain whether reclamation work can begin under the current administration.

    Largest Kai Tak drill yet meets expectations: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Mable Chan said on Saturday that it took just 45 minutes to process spectators after a test event at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The largest drill to date involved some 63,000 people, and was held on Friday evening at three venues at the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chan said extra MTR train services had been laid on and ten extra bus routes were arranged to carry 7,300 passengers, which was higher than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two franchised bus operators arranged the ten special routes... We hope these routes can be used to carry passengers when large-scale events are organised in the future. So it would be similar to the arrangements at the Hong Kong Coliseum and the Hong Kong Stadium," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan said Greater Bay Airlines had let passengers and the government down, after it cancelled more than 100 flights for February and March, blaming factors like delayed aircraft deliveries and inspection requirements. She said it's been asked to submit a report on the problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said she hoped it's better prepared to deal with increased traffic expected over the Lunar New Year and Easter holidays.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said that a Hong Kong resident who was detained in Myanmar and forced to carry out illegal work will return to the SAR on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government task force has been in Thailand investigating reports that a number of Hongkongers had been lured to Southeast Asian countries and held against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the 29-year-old man had been rescued and taken to Thailand, and was in good shape mentally and physically.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the man will return to the city, accompanied by members of the task force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would do its utmost to rescue the remaining ten Hong Kong residents being detained in the region, noting that civil conflicts present challenges to the task force members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, I have been seeing the Myanmar consulate and also the Cambodian consulate in Hong Kong to discuss how to have the safe return of our Hong Kong people," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all parties were committed to doing their utmost to ensure the safe return of the Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its support and assistance, allowing the man to reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year.

    Trump Administration freezes foreign aid

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sent an internal memo effectively freezing most US foreign aid. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789082_1_20250125091823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, the world's biggest donor, froze virtually all foreign aid on Friday, making exceptions only for emergency food, and military funding for Israel and Egypt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent an internal memo days after President Donald Trump took office vowing an "America First" policy of tightly restricting assistance overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No new funds shall be obligated for new awards or extensions of existing awards until each proposed new award or extension has been reviewed and approved," said the memo to staff seen by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sweeping order appears to affect everything from development assistance to military aid -- including to Ukraine, which received billions of dollars in weapons under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden as it tries to repel a Russian invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also means a pause of at least several months of US funding for PEPFAR, the anti-HIV/AIDS initiative that buys anti-retroviral drugs to treat the disease in developing countries, largely in Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched under president George W. Bush in 2003, PEPFAR is credited with saving some 26 million lives and until recently enjoyed broad popular support along partisan lines in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the memo explicitly made exceptions for military assistance to Israel -- whose longstanding major arms packages from the United States have expanded further since the Gaza war -- and Egypt, which has received generous US defense funding since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also made an exception for US contributions to emergency food assistance, which the United States ahs been contributing following crises around the world including in Sudan and Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers from the rival Democratic Party said that more than 20 million people relied on medication through PEPFAR and 63 million people on US-funded anti-malaria efforts including nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For years, Republicans in Congress have decried what they see as a lack of US credibility vis-a-vis countries like China, Russia, and Iran," said Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Lois Frankel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now our credibility is on the line, and it appears we will cut and run from American commitments to our partners around the world," they wrote in a letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has long leveraged aid as a tool of its foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeks and Frankel also noted that foreign assistance is appropriated by Congress and said they would seek its implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo allows the State Department to make other case-by-case exceptions and temporarily to fund salaries to staff and other administrative expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The memo called for an internal review of all foreign assistance within 85 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In justifying the freeze, Rubio -- who as a senator was a supporter of development assistance -- wrote that it was impossible for the new administration to assess whether existing foreign aid commitments "are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has long been the world's top donor in dollar terms, although a number of European nations, especially in Scandinavia, give significantly more as a percent of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave more than US$64 billion in overseas development assistance in 2023, the last year for which records were available, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which advises industrialised countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had already on taking office Monday signed an executive order suspending foreign assistance for 90 days, but it was not immediately clear how it would be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-poverty group Oxfam said that Trump was abandoning a longstanding consensus in the United States for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian and development assistance accounts for only around one percent of the federal budget; it saves lives, fights diseases, educates millions of children and reduces poverty," Oxfam America president Abby Maxman said in a statement. (AFP)

    Profit-taking pushes US markets lower

<img alt="Wall Street's major indices opened flat, and ended the session lower. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789069_1_20250125055434.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets concluded a winning week on a tepid note on Friday, retreating following mixed earnings in a move attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a flattish open, all three major indices moved into negative territory -- a trend that held the rest of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is normal consolidation or profit taking after a big 2-week rally," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which closed at a record on Thursday, fell 0.3 percent to 6,101.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 percent to 44,424.25, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 19,954.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have gained in recent sessions following benign US inflation data, strong earnings from banks and the new presidency of Donald Trump in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets have thus far welcomed his growth-oriented agenda and largely shrugged off his threats of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarhan said the market was poised for a pause given the heavy calendar next week, which includes a Federal Reserve monetary policy decision and earnings from tech giants and other big companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Facebook parent Meta gained 3.2 percent after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would invest up to US$65 billion in 2025 in new artificial intelligence infrastructure, including a datacentre "so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing dropped 1.4 percent after announcing it will incur a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter due mainly to costs connected to a lengthy labour strike last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others with big earnings-related moves included American Express, down 1.4 percent; CSX, down 5.8 percent; and Texas Instruments, down 13.1 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Friday, saying both sides should find the right way to get along in the new era.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first known contact between the two top diplomats since Donald Trump was sworn in as US president on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart had an important discussion last Friday, pointing out the direction and setting the tone for bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister said both sides should follow through on the important consensus reached by the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing and Washington should maintain communication, manage differences, expand cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said China will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States has made a solemn commitment to pursue the one-China policy in the three Sino-US joint communiques and must not break its promise,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, for his part, said Washington is willing to hold open discussions with Beijing, and that the US opposes "Taiwan independence". (Xinhua and agencies)

<img alt="Eric Chan, centre, said it's too early to declare that the Kai Tak Sports Park will officially open on March 1. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789051_1_20250124230739.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the largest drill to date was successfully held at Kai Tak Sports Park on Friday evening, involving some 63,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most of the participants were government workers or people from community groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-hour drills were held at three venues -- the main stadium, the Kai Tak Arena and the youth sports ground, as officials tested out arrangements with the first two having capacity crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the 50,000-seater main stadium, bands from the disciplined forces put on a concert, as different scenarios, including simulated security issues, were tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials carried out evacuation drills as well as having spectators leave in a regular manner at the other two venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior officials, including Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law and civil service chief Ingrid Yeung were on hand to observe the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the park is scheduled to open sometime in March, but added reports saying that March 1 is the official opening day might be premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have many stress tests in the future - we have two large-scale stress tests [next month], so up to now, depending on the results of the tests, I think we cannot confirm the opening date," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the tests, all participants left the venues at around the same time as they picked their own mode of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities recorded crowd control and transport data for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added the scheduling of events in future should ensure that a capacity crowd at the three venues would not leave the park at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities mapped out worst-case scenarios to train up the ability of different parties to react to emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several participants told RTHK they were happy with the experience, saying signs giving directions were good and the sound system was solid.

 Two men were charged on Friday with murdering a man in Yuen Long in the early hours of Wednesday, as well as wounding another.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair, 19 and 27, are due to appear in Fanling Court on Saturday. The 27-year-old suspect also faces a charge of possessing dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two defendants were among six men arrested so far over the death of the 24-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said two suspects, 23 and 26, were arrested in Tin Shui Wai on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place outside an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West, when two men were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them died and the other was conscious when he was taken to hospital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Jannik Sinner overcame some third-set cramping and beat Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to return to the Australian Open final as he pursues a third Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The No.1-ranked Sinner, a 23-year-old from Italy, fell behind in the opening set and twice was a point from losing it when Shelton served at 6-5. But Sinner broke there, then dominated the ensuing tiebreaker, and broke again to begin the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only trouble Sinner ran into the rest of the way was when he clutched at his left hamstring, and then his right thigh, in the third set. He was treated by a trainer, who massaged both of Sinner's legs during changeovers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first major title at Melbourne Park a year ago, then grabbed his second one at the US Open in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll try to add to that total when he faces No. 2 Alexander Zverev on Sunday for the championship.
  <br>

    Japan's interest rates highest in 17 years

<img alt="Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference that the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789025_1_20250124192649.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates on Friday to their highest in 17 years and signalled more hikes to come, sending the yen higher against the greenback.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-basis-point rise to 0.5 percent comes as data indicated the Japanese economy was developing in line with BoJ expectations and followed another bumper inflation reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move, which leaves borrowing costs at the highest since 2008, was also underpinned by "steadily" rising wages and financial markets being "stable on the whole", the BoJ said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan's economic activity and prices have been developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook, and the likelihood of realising the outlook has been rising," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If its outlook is met, "the bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BoJ chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to make a decision after we have studied the impact of this rate hike," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hawkish comments sent the yen up as much as 0.7 percent against the US dollar to 154.84 yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as other central banks have raised borrowing costs in recent years -- and started cutting again in 2024 -- the BoJ has remained an outlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it concluded last March that Japan's "lost decades" of economic stagnation and static, or falling prices were over, finally lifting rates above zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  That increase was followed by another in July that caught investors off guard and sparked turmoil in global equity and currency markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time Ueda prepared markets for an increase -- some 75 percent of economists expected one -- and the reaction was more muted on Friday. (AFP)

    LCSD lowers age limit to 8 at licensed billiard halls

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licensed billiard establishments that meet specific criteria can apply to let people as young as eight years old enter these premises, as a means of promoting the sport's development in Hong Kong, said the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, only those aged 16 or above are allowed entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other relaxations include allowing young patrons to stay until 11pm, compared with 8pm right now, and they could enter as early as 7am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those in school uniforms will also be permitted to enter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said licensed billiard establishments hoping to accept younger patrons can make applications from February 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China (HKBSCC), said he hopes the department can clearly lay out the specific requirements that billiard halls need to take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The details of the requirements are yet to be announced, but according to my understanding, you have to have certain security facilities implemented in the premises, for example, maybe CCTV. Also you need certain tools and facilities which are suitable for use by children," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During some sessions, such as training sessions and tournaments, there needs to be some coach who is qualified to coach billiard sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said that he hopes to see all restrictions removed in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is only a first step because I think the ultimate objective is to completely remove all restrictions on billiard establishments because we are just like any other sports venue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why should there be a restriction on the age of the person who uses the facilities?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he hopes to see the LCSD promote the scheme to the around 50 currently licensed billiard halls, noting that establishment owners will have to assess the administrative work and costs before considering to apply.

    'Beetroot salad not ruled out in poisoning cases'

<img alt="Health officials say they can't rule out that a beetroot salad gave passengers on two Cathay flights food poisoning earlier this month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789003_1_20250124174253.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said on Friday that they could not rule out that beetroot salad contaminated with a bacterium served on board was responsible for the suspected food poisoning suffered by dozens of passengers of two Cathay Pacific flights arriving from Nepal this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said its investigation found that 43 passengers, aged between 11 and 75, developed food poisoning symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, about 10 to 60 minutes after having meals on the CX640 flights from Kathmandul on January 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the passengers had to be taken to hospital, the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stool samples from two patients tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The overall clinical symptoms and incubation period of the affected persons were compatible with food poisoning caused by Staphylococcus aureus," the centre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the beetroot salad was the only food served on board that was likely to have caused such poisoning, from a statistical standpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, tests on samples taken from the aircraft showed the level of Staphylococcus aureus in the salad did not exceed food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said the food was supplied exclusively to Cathay for its flights from Kathmandu since the start of the month and the factory concerned was later asked to stop providing it. Inspections of the factory found the way the food was being handled might have increased the risk of contamination.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Cathay acknowledged the findings but stressed that no signs of contamination were found in the samples it checked in its own lab.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific confirms that this salad is not served on any of our other flights. Aside from these two cases, there have not been any similar instances of customers experiencing symptoms of suspected food poisoning on any of our recent flights," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline apologised again to passengers affected and added that it has reinforced food-handling processes and staff training on hygiene.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record high winds from Storm Eowyn battered Ireland and Northern Ireland on Friday, leaving 560,000 homes and businesses without power and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closure of schools and public transport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had warned the storm was set to be one of the most dangerous they have faced and told people to stay indoors. The Irish weather agency, Met Eireann, said a gust of 182 kilometres per hour overnight at Mace Head in County Galway provisionally broke an 80-year record.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESB Networks, which provides energy for the whole of Ireland, said "unprecedented" damage to its network had led to power outages affecting 560,000 homes, farms and businesses. It expected significant outages as the storm tracks northwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The power company said ahead of the storm that it could take up to nine days to restore power for some customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 110 scheduled departures and 110 arrivals at Dublin airport were cancelled, the airport said, adding that further cancellations and delays were possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  All schools in Ireland and Northern Ireland were closed on Friday and public transport will not run in Ireland while a red wind warning remains in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The red warning - the highest alert level - was in place for the entire country for the first time since Storm Ophelia in 2017, which killed three people.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is due to be lifted for most of Ireland at 1100 GMT and in British-ruled Northern Ireland at 1400.
  <br>
  <br>
  A red warning is also in place for southwestern and central areas of Scotland from 10am until 5pm GMT, the UK Met Office said, warning people to expect flying debris resulting in danger to life, damage to buildings with roofs blown off and the closure of roads and bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of flights from airports at Edinburgh and Glasgow were cancelled, and National Rail advised people living across Scotland and parts of northern England not to travel on Friday. (Reuters)

    Injured Djokovic bows out of Australian Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators booed an injured Novak Djokovic as he left the court in Rod Laver Arena after quitting one set into his Australian Open semifinal against Alexander Zverev on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dealing with a what he said was a torn muscle, Djokovic lost the opener 7-6 (5) when he put a forehand volley into the net, then began shaking his head and immediately walked over to shake Zverev's hand. The 37-year-old Djokovic packed up his equipment and walked off toward the locker room, pausing to respond to the jeers by giving two thumbs-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his news conference, Djokovic said the pain in his taped left leg was “getting worse and worse.” He hurt it during his quarterfinal victory over Carlos Alcaraz on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I knew," Djokovic said, "even if I won the first set, it was going to be a huge uphill battle for me.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was bidding for an 11th championship at the Australian Open and record 25th Grand Slam title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this is the second time in the past four major tournaments he was unable to finish because of an injury: He withdrew from last year's French Open before the quarterfinals because he tore the meniscus in his right knee during a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic underwent surgery in Paris and, less than two months later, reached the final at Wimbledon, then won a gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The No. 2-seeded Zverev reached his first title match at Melbourne Park and on Sunday will face the winner of Friday’s second semifinal between No. 1 Jannik Sinner of Italy, the defending champion, and No. 21 Ben Shelton of the United States. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

 A worker died after falling to the ground at a construction site on Tsung Tau Ha Road in Fo Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report at around 1pm on Friday that a man fell from a height of between three and four metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to scene where the man was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to investigate the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu Kin-keung, the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said the deceased welding worker was on a spider lift platform before the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed that a fractured steel beam struck the platform, causing it and the worker to fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker had his safety harness attached to the platform but that also broke, Chiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said it would be providing support to the family of the man killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the accident marked at least the 10th fatal fall since the beginning of last year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Friday urged the government to step up efforts to promote Hong Kong’s tourist spots and nurture more talent in the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, the party called for more religious and architectural tours to showcase the city's beauty beyond Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the traditional shopping theme that we are quite well-recognised in the international arena, we would also like international tourists to know about how Hong Kong is naturally beautiful," said FTU lawmaker Joephy Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Victoria Harbour, of course, there are also different sea views that you can have in Hong Kong. We need to further elaborate on that on different social [media] platforms as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan suggested journeys to temples, mosques and landmarks such as Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park to promote religious diversity and peace education.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another FTU lawmaker, Dennis Leung, highlighted the need for more training for tour guides and the recruitment of retirees into the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we have some sites in New Territories where the younger generation do not understand the history, so we hope that the government can gather all the village inhabitants or some retired people to help to promote tourism, to act as a guide to help the visitors to know more about the culture in this visiting site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party also urged officials to improve accessibility to tourist spots by adding more bus routes.

    Tourists want to see pandas all over Hong Kong: DAB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmakers on Friday said each district should have panda-themed events and decorations to encourage tourists to explore different places across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The party said it has submitted various suggestions to the government's Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, which was established last year to come up with ways to revitalise the tourism industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng said Hong Kong should promote the concept of "panda is everywhere" on top of "tourism is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a good chance for businesses to have a showcase everywhere, in different districts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of visitors, they're not only visiting the places, they also would like to see panda decorations everywhere in Hong Kong. We can also dress them up. Like in Sham Shui Po, they can dress up like a Sham Shui Po special edition for the panda as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions the party made included a walking tour in Central and Western for tourists to visit temples and taste food and drink, including sugarcane juice and dim sum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the legislators urged the authorities to set up a one-stop platform to enable event organisers to reach out to different government departments in a more simple way.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

    'Blatantly unconstitutional' birthright order blocked

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge blocked Donald Trump's attempt to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States on Thursday as liberal states scored their first victory against the new president's hardline agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling imposes a 14-day stay on the enforcement of one of the most controversial executive orders Trump signed in the hours after he was sworn into office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a blatantly unconstitutional order," US District Judge John Coughenour was reported as saying during the hearing in Washington state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been on the bench for over four decades, I can't remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is," said Coughenour, who was appointed by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters his administration would "obviously" appeal the ruling, while the Department of Justice said it would defend the executive order, which a spokesman said "correctly interprets" the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to presenting a full merits argument to the court and to the American people, who are desperate to see our nation's laws enforced," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the US Constitution under the 14th Amendment which decrees that anyone born on US soil is a citizen.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says, in part: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order was premised on the idea that anyone in the United States illegally, or on a visa, was not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.
  <br>
  <br>
  An incredulous Coughenour chided Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate over his assertion that Trump's order was constitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order," Coughenour said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just boggles my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling comes after a flurry of lawsuits filed by 22 states, two cities and numerous civil rights groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was hailed by states that took part in the legal actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No president can change the constitution on a whim and today's decision affirms that," Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling is "the first of many wins to come as my office fights instances of executive overreach and any illegal actions the new administration may take."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said Trump's order was "un-American."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Birthright citizenship makes clear that citizenship cannot be conditioned on one's race, ethnicity or where their parents came from," he said after the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the law of our nation, recognised by generations of jurists, lawmakers and presidents, until President Trump's illegal action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal challenge was no surprise, and Trump had acknowledged it was likely when he signed the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has repeatedly – and wrongly – asserted that the United States is the only country in the world with birthright citizenship; in fact more than 30 others also have it, including Canada and Mexico. (AFP)

 A Hong Kong woman on holiday in Japan has died after being hit by a train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese media reports said the woman, 61, was standing on tracks near Otaru, Hokkaido on Thursday and was taking photos of the sea when she was struck by the train.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyodo News Agency cited police as saying the woman's husband was standing nearby at the time but was not injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident caused the suspension of almost 20 train services, including some to the region's main airport, railway officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Consulate in Sapporo and the Immigration Department in Hong Kong both said they were ready to help the woman's family if assistance was required.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said his conversation with President Xi Jinping last week was friendly, and he thought he could reach a trade deal with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders of the world's two biggest economies discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan in a phone call before Trump took office on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office, Trump has spoken about a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports. He has also threatened tariffs against the European Union, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went fine. It was a good, friendly conversation," Trump said of his call with President Xi in an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can do that," Trump said when asked if he could make a deal with China over fair trade practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would rather not use tariffs against China but called tariffs a "tremendous power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we have one very big power over China, and that's tariffs, and they don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it, but it's a tremendous power over China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has vowed to defend its national interests over Trump's threat to impose the duty, with the Foreign Ministry saying there are no winners in a trade or tariff war. (Reuters and agencies)

    'Travel agencies should be flexible in giving refund'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on travel agencies to be flexible in refunding passengers affected by the cancellation of flights at Greater Bay Airlines.
 <br>
  <br>
  The low-cost carrier earlier announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, while stressing that Lunar New Year services won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog had received six complaints as of Thursday night, involving about HK$14,000 in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Gilly Wong told an RTHK radio programme on Friday that travel agencies should maintain close contact with the airline to offer refunds to passengers as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In principle, they (agencies) should only arrange a refund after receiving the money [from the airline]. But they can exercise discretion and compassion when handling individual cases," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong pointed out that some agencies had told passengers it could take months for them to get their money back, but said in some cases the refund should arrive earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they only stick to the rulebook, that leads to customer dissatisfaction and complaints. It's not an ideal approach in terms of their reputation."
  <br>

  Wong also said Greater Bay Airlines should not impose surcharges for passengers opting for other destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the airline should offer updates and reach out to consumers quickly.

 NBA superstars LeBron James and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were named among the starters for next month's NBA All-Star Game.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City star Gilgeous-Alexander and Los Angeles Lakers icon James were included in the Western Conference's five starters along with Golden State's Stephen Curry, Phoenix's Kevin Durant and Denver's Nikola Jokić.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander has been in blistering form for the Oklahoma City Thunder this season, scoring a career-high 54 points in his most recent outing.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the 26-year-old Gilgeous-Alexander's third All-Star selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, meanwhile, will be making his 21st All-Star Game – all of them as a starter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Conference starters included the Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell earns his sixth All-Star appearance, with the starters completed by two New York Knicks players – Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 All-Star weekend will take place in San Francisco from February 14 to 16. (AFP)

    Wembanyama delights Paris crowd, leads Spurs to win

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788921_1_20250124073743.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victor Wembanyama delighted his home crowd in Paris by scoring 30 points and grabbing 11 rebounds as he led the San Antonio Spurs to a 140-110 rout of the Indiana Pacers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old centre took control of the game in a third-quarter performance when the Spurs roared into a 23-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama was playing in the French league a year and a half ago before his selection as the number one pick in the 2023 draft set him on the path to global stardom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Returning to France with the Spurs for the first time, Wembanyama's first block of the game brought roars from the 15,935 crowd at a sold-out the Bercy Arena, where he helped France win the men's basketball silver medal at the Paris Olympics last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was an even bigger cheer when he scored his first points 4 minutes into the game from a shot from the lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was one of the matches that was closest to my heart," Wembanyama said. "And in terms of pure performance, it's in the top five."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means everything. It's crazy to have the public like that – tonight was different," he added. "It's a different kind of support that the crowd brings and we tried to use the circumstances to our advantage and tonight was an easy night to use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of two regular-season games in the French capital this week was watched by a host of former NBA stars including French four-time champion Tony Parker, his former San Antonio teammates Manu Ginobili and David Robinson, as well as Pau Gasol and the legendary Oscar Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris Saint-Germain footballers Ousmane Dembele and Achraf Hakimi and Super Bowl winner Odell Beckham Jr. were also on hand to enjoy the action.
  <br>
  <br>
  They saw Wembanyama drive Spurs to a 103-80 lead in the third quarter with three rejections in a row, two assists and a thunderous dunk, bringing the crowd to the feet to chant "MVP, MVP, MVP".
  <br>
  <br>
  His teammate Devin Vassell contributed 25 points for the Spurs, who could afford to bench Wembanyama and his fellow starters with five minutes remaining. They moved to a 20-22 record for the season and stay in contention for the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennedict Mathurin top-scored for the Pacers with 24 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs meet the Pacers again on the same court on Saturday. (AFP)

<img alt="Tottenham are sixth in the table after their victory over Hoffenheim. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788918_2_20250124070744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United and Tottenham both enjoyed some much needed respite from their Premier League woes with victories in the Europa League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes conjured up the injury time winner in United's 2-1 defeat of Scottish giants Rangers, while in Germany Son Heung-min scored twice in a 3-2 win for Spurs at Hoffenheim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both English teams closed in on direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils looked set to suffer more disappointment at Old Trafford when Cyriel Dessers levelled for an injury-ravaged Rangers in the 88th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Scottish side had fallen behind when goalkeeper Jack Butland punched the ball into his own net early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes spared United's blushes and possibly the playoff round by blasting home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  United were earlier controversially denied a goal when Matthijs de Ligt's towering header was ruled out for a foul on Robin Propper and VAR did not intervene.
  <br>
  <br>
  United move up to fourth in the table with one match of the league phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight will qualify directly for the last 16, which may now be beyond Rangers who slip to 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today was important to get the win because we want to get through in the Europa League, we want to go to the final," said Fernandes. "We want to be in the first eight so we avoid playing two more games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs are sixth in the revamped league phase format topped by Lazio, who beat Real Sociedad 3-1 to ensure their ticket to the knock out stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Ferencvaros 2-0, are placed second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Son and James Maddison took some of the heat off Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou whose team have lost seven of their last nine Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou had pledged to win silverware for the first time for the London side since 2008 in his second season as boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Spurs struggling in 15th behind Liverpool at home that leaves the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup to fulfil his promise.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Swedish outfit Elfsborg in their closing league phase game at home next week will give them an automatic ticket to the next round as one of the top eight finishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them to enjoy it," Postecoglou said. "Winning away in Europe, it's a significant victory for us and gives us a good foothold to get into those top eight spots which will give us a week off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham charged out of the stalls with Maddison receiving a pinpoint pass from Pedro Porro to fire the ball past keeper Oliver Baumann and into the roof of the net to give Spurs the perfect start after just four minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richarlison, making only his second start of the campaign, could have doubled the advantage but the Brazilian's shot went straight to Baumann.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacking at will Spurs were looking to put the game to bed against their out of sorts German hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on 22 minutes Maddison turned provider to set up Son whose shot deflected off a defender, the ball flying over Baumann and into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The big problem for Spurs given their leaky defence was to hold onto their superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brandon Austin started in goal for them, two weeks after making his debut, and was called on to make a full-stretch save to deny Tom Bischof as half-time beckoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the wind in their sails Hoffenheim halved their deficit minutes later when Spurs got caught on the counter, Anton Stach toeing the ball past Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Son's angled shot with 13 minutes left on the clock settled the issue, although David Mokwa's goal two minutes from normal time meant another nerve-jangling ending for Tottenham's long-suffering supporters. (AFP)

    Wall Street ends higher after Trump comments

<img alt="Wall Street closed higher, buoyed by President Trump's comments to the World Economic Forum. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788911_1_20250124054159.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended higher on Thursday, shrugging off early weakness as investors digested President Donald Trump's remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's much-anticipated video appearance included a call for lower interest rates, a renewed threat of tariffs on companies that plan to import items and a pledge to cut corporate taxes further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors cheered the message on tax cuts, which Trump held out as a "carrot" to attract investment as compared with the "stick" of tariffs, said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 44,565.07.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 percent to 6,118.71, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 20,053.68.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly everyone understands the tariff message and now we're hearing more about the tax incentives," said Ablin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin noted that Trump has not advanced a campaign trail proposal to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by 60 percent, evidence of some "moderation" in the returning president's tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, American Airlines slumped 8.7 percent as it issued a disappointing profit forecast for 2025. The carrier projected a loss in the first quarter, but predicted travel demand would strengthen later in the year, boosting earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But GE Aerospace jumped 6.6 percent as it reported better than expected profits and offered a positive 2025 outlook on robust demand for commercial aviation engines and services. (AFP)

<img alt="The SAR government called on the UK to stop interfering in Hong Kong matters. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788899_1_20250123231643.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Thursday said it condemns and strongly disapproves of a recent meeting between UK officials and national security suspects wanted by Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Catherine West earlier met with four Hong Kong fugitives based in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government expressed its strong disapproval and condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Endangering national security is a very serious crime. No country will watch with folded arms the acts and activities that endanger national security. Those persons who have fled overseas are suspected of continuing to commit offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law,” a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The UK Government has ignored the malicious acts of those wanted persons, which showcases the hypocrisy with double standards."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson stressed that SAR law enforcement agencies will exhaust all means to pursue the fugitives, and called on the UK to stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they have arrested four men for their alleged involvement in a murder case in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man died and another was hurt on Wednesday, after they were attacked by a group of knife-wielding men when they were leaving an industrial building on Wang Yip Street West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Tang Yick-kay said two of the arrestees had tried to escape to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The police learned that the two, aged 20 and 21, had flown to Bangkok on Wednesday. We quickly alerted the Thai authorities through our cooperation channels. The two men were subsequently denied entry at Bangkok airport and were sent back to Hong Kong on a flight,” he said, adding that the pair was arrested upon their arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers made one more arrest at the Hong Kong International Airport; while the fourth man was taken from a Tuen Mun flat, where suspected space oil drugs were also found.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four people arrested, aged 20 to 29, are said to have ties to a triad and are being held for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still tracking down on other suspects, and urged members of the public to come forward with information.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet has been elected the new chairman of the Bar Association, succeeding the outgoing Victor Dawes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Counsels Martin Hui and Eva Sit, meanwhile, were chosen as vice-chairmen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the election on Thursday evening, Maurellet said the association will continue to defend the rule of law and judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the professional body will adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct, discipline and etiquette.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that while there are calls for Hong Kong to focus on developing the economy this year, he stressed the rule of law and economic development go hand in hand to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet also expressed hope that more overseas non-permanent judges can be appointed to the city’s top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Obviously we would welcome the appointment of further such experienced jurists to our court. We believe that it strengthens Hong Kong as a jurisdiction and is also supported by members of the public,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maurellet was appointed as Senior Counsel in 2016, and had served as vice chairman for the Bar Association for six years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The opening of a new harbourfront walkway in North Point will create shared spaces for Hongkongers with stunning views of Victoria Harbour, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Coast boardwalk - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.1-kilometre section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government hopes to open the eastern section by the end of this year, adding efforts are underway to make the harbour more accessible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Ho, chairman of the Harbourfront Commission, said there’s a shared space for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a shared path which allows people to cycle, walk dogs and jog, so basically we are encouraging people to use our boardwalk together in a harmonious way,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We also created what we call a pocket space, which allow children to play around, allow some small-scale function or activity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said construction has not been easy with height restrictions and machinery constraints, and officials have tried to minimise disturbance to nearby residents.

    Snakes and pandas galore as LNY fairs open

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lunar New Year fairs kicked off at 15 sites across Hong Kong on Thursday, with many a panda-themed product among the array of goods, flowers and fast food on offer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Snakes were also spotted rearing their heads among the goodies, what with the Year of the Snake about to get underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students were running some of the stalls at Victoria Park – home to the city's biggest fair – hoping to put their newly acquired business management skills and sales techniques into practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flower-seller said she has been a regular at the fair for two decades and isn't worried that a sluggish economy and people heading elsewhere to spend will put a dent in her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lunar New Year is just once a year, for good fortune, people will buy and put them at home like they always do," the woman told RTHK, adding that she has a loyal customer base for her oranges.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman shopping with her children was delighted with the atmosphere at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, I think there are more people than in previous years. Perhaps it's because during Covid, only flowers were sold at the fairs. Now with more dry goods, everyone's happier, the children are happier," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs officers are also planning to attend the fairs, with flyers and souvenirs to be handed out to remind people the importance of respecting copyright law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divisional Commander Ho Chun-wing said officers on patrol will take immediate action if they find anything suspicious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong people do like goods with popular models. So we will put a lot of effort into targeting those goods with suspected counterfeiting trademarks and copyright," he told RTHK.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog on Thursday said the number of data breach incidents in the city increased by 30 percent last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data received more than 200 data breach reports last year, in which 30 percent of them involved hacking and 25 percent involved the loss of documents or portable devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the value of personal data has increased with the rapid development of digitalisation, and she expects the trend to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office conducted a review of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and made suggestions which included the mandatory notification of data breaches, a complete review of the penalty levels outlined in the ordinance and also empowering the Privacy Commissioner to hand down administrative fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the level of penalty administered, Chung said her office would take Hong Kong's economic situation into account and make reference to similar legislation in other jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the process of consultation, we have received feedback saying that, for example, small and medium enterprises, they are concerned about the effect of all these penalties on their business environment and their compliance costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the government and my office would take all these concerns into account in formulating the concrete details."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says it will give its staff bonuses worth at least a month's pay following positive financial results in the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to employees, CEO Ronald Lam said the final level will be announced alongside the company's annual financial postings in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to share that we will be distributing at least four weeks of eligible pay this year," Lam said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also told staff that the company successfully completed its rebuilding journey last year, allowing flights to return to 100 percent of pre-Covid levels this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strong financial performance for two years in a row also made it possible for us to commit more than HK$100 billion investments into further elevating our customers' experience in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam vowed to work towards Cathay's vision of "becoming one of the world's greatest service brands".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's four lines of business, namely Cathay Pacific, Cathay Cargo, Cathay Lifestyle and HK Express, have formulated robust plans to serve customers and deliver great profitability, Lam added.

 Cathay Pacific has apologised to customers after technical issues temporarily disrupted a number of services, including flight bookings and online check-in.
 <br>
  <br>
  The services affected started returning to normal after 2pm on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various services online and at self check-in kiosks were unavailable "due to a system issue", according to the flagship carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport check-in counters were not affected and Cathay's flight operations remained normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused and are grateful for their patience," the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had earlier advised passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure to allow sufficient time to complete check-in formalities.

    New wildfire north of LA threatens tens of thousands

 More than 50,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings on Wednesday as a huge and fast-moving wildfire swept through the rugged mountains north of Los Angeles.
 <br>
  <br>
  But fire officials said a rapid ground and air assault was giving them the upper hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hughes Fire broke out in the late morning and within six hours charred about 15 square miles (39 square kilometres) of trees and brush near Lake Castaic, a popular recreation area about 40 miles (64 kilometres) from the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires that are burning for a third week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the region was under a red flag warning, winds were not as fast as they had been when those fires broke out, allowing for firefighting aircraft to dump tens of thousands of gallons of fire retardant.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The situation that we’re in today is very different from the situation we were in 16 days ago,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reported homes or other structures burned.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This fire had a robust response today, and as you can see behind us, the responders are doing great work to try to contain this fire," Joe Tyler, director of Cal Fire, said. “Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 31,000 people have been ordered to evacuate, and another 23,000 are under evacuation warnings, LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said.

    Thailand starts recognising same-sex marriages

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of LGBT couples in Thailand are expected to make their wedded status legal on Thursday, the first day a law took effect granting them the same rights as heterosexual couples.
 <br>
  <br>
  The enactment of the Marriage Equality Act makes Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marriage registration is customarily done at district offices, but on Thursday, around 300 couples were expected to complete the formalities at a day-long gala celebration in an exhibition hall at a shopping mall in central Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds more are predicted to register in less fancy circumstances around the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marriage equality bill, which sailed through both houses of parliament, amended the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words “men and women” and “husband and wife” to “individuals” and “marriage partners.” It is supposed to open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBT couples.
  <br>
  <br>
  Partners will have equal rights and responsibilities in dealing with joint assets, tax obligations and deductions, inheritance rights and survivor benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok’s city government has said that it organised workshops for staff of all its district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included lectures raising awareness about gender diversity and guidance on how to properly communicate with those who come for the service. The Interior Ministry has offered similar guidance. (AP)

  In July, the organisation suffered a ransomware attack, affecting its information systems and resulting in file encryption and data exfiltration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog’s investigation revealed that over 330 GB of data was exfiltrated from Oxfam’s systems, potentially affecting about 550,000 subjects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaked data included identity card and passport copies, credit card and bank account numbers of Oxfam staff members, donors, job applicants and governance members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said Oxfam had not updated its firewalls since 2023, and it failed to take any action despite multiple detections of suspicious activities prior to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is a very regrettable situation, because basically we found that the data security measures adopted by Oxfam before the incident were neither adequate nor effective,” Chung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That was why it was relatively easy for the hacker to gain access into Oxfam’s system, because basically the firewalls were outdated, and some of the servers had significant vulnerabilities as well.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung added Oxfam retained some personal data for a period longer than necessary, including multiple items being held for over seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it served an enforcement notice on Oxfam, as it contravened the data protection principle, in which the organisation will have to take measures to prevent similar contraventions in the future.

    'SME business confidence shaken by Trump policies'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's incoming policies are casting a shadow over business confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the city, an economist said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelvin Lau, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said Washington has contributed to global economic uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the biggest uncertainties recently is the retrenchment of US rate cut expectations. Secondly, it's the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, how fast and how far he would take them higher," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the results of a Productivity Council survey, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index fell to 42.8 in the January-to-March period, down 2.9 points from the previous three months. Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, while those above 50 show a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop indicated the overall business confidence of local SMEs "has become more conservative under the uncertain global economic outlook", the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the more than 800 local firms polled, around 38 percent said the US presidential transition had affected their business confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They cited potential tariffs and changes in the economic environment as primary factors. Trump had warned of imposing a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports as soon as February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of things are less to do with local issues, but more to do with external issues. But then the downside is, because it's external, there are a very few things that we can actually control about it," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We're just hoping that we can also benefit from more policy easing from the US and from China as well. Hopefully the achievement of a global soft landing will help Hong Kong maintain a modest pace of recovery."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the first round of potential tariffs would be "in line with market expectations", and further hikes, which might not come until 2026, would bring more certainty to enterprises.

<img alt="Beijing has unveiled plans to support the markets by ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788800_1_20250123122135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced plans on Thursday to channel hundreds of billions of yuan annually into shares from state-owned insurers, in the country's latest effort to support its domestic equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan (US$13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30 percent of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10 percent annually over the next three years, Wu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also said China's public offering fund sector had maintained a stable development trend in recent years, with further measures set to boost the development of this sector in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assets under the management of China's public offering funds rose to 33 trillion yuan (about US$4.6 trillion) by the end of 2024 from 13 trillion yuan in 2019, according to Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the sales fees of public offering funds would be further slashed, saving a total of 45 billion yuan annually for investors, Wu told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index advanced 1.47 percent shortly after open on Thursday while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.62 percent. The Hang Seng Index similarly gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the country's financial authorities signalled they would encourage medium- and long-term funds into the capital market to further stabilise stock performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, jointly released by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission, as well as five government departments, stressed attracting funds from commercial insurance, national social security and basic pension funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annuity funds, public funds, and other medium- to long-term capital funds were also expected to increase their stock market investments, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan aims to increase the proportion and stability of A-share investment in the portfolios of commercial insurance companies, and improve the investment management mechanism of the national social security fund and the basic pension insurance fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of state-owned insurance companies will be assessed over a cycle of more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the national social security and basic pension funds, the evaluation periods will be over five years and over three years, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have been intensifying policy support to prop up share prices as the world's second-largest economy navigates deflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They introduced swap and re-lending schemes totalling 800 billion yuan for stock purchases in September as well as guidelines on market capitalisation management to encourage companies to improve shareholder returns. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Govt says Greater Bay Airlines has room to improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Thursday said there's room for improvement in the performance of Greater Bay Airlines which has announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media gathering, Chan said the airline could have done better with flight arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister also said the government will try to help the company, which faces operational difficulties, as much as possible, but that officials won't give special treatment to individual firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the carrier should minimise the inconvenience caused, and rebuild confidence among passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CEO of Greater Bay Airlines said Lunar New Year services will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liza Ng apologised on a Commercial Radio programme for the flight cancellations, blamed on a delay in the arrival of new aircraft and planned inspections of planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng admitted that the airline could have done better at informing those customers affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we notified all 5,500 passengers about the cancellations at the same time, by doing so, they will definitely be nervous as it will affect their trip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they called us, our staff might not have been able to pick up their calls immediately, making them more anxious. In this case, our customer service didn't handle the incident too well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the airline has boosted manpower and will look at setting up more communication channels for keeping customers informed of developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, an academic who specialises in aviation transport told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it's usual practice for airlines to start selling tickets for flights involving new aircraft that have yet to be delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Achim Czerny, a professor at Polytechnic University's department of logistics and maritime studies, said buying new planes is a massive investment and the aircraft must be fully utilised as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft deliveries, the airline business is a relatively complex business, and the performance of an airline depends on many players along the supply chain, for instance, aircraft manufacturers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's certainly something that's not entirely under the control of the airline."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told RTHK it is crucial that Greater Bay Airlines reviews its flight scheduling, as well as the destinations it flies to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airline only has a fleet of eight planes and this means there isn't much flexibility to make temporary adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the airline opened new routes, the changes in local environment, political situation, or all kinds of negative news will affect the overall passenger traffic. These are unpredictable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, it's also challenging for the airline, as well as the tourism sector, because a destination that used to be a popular tourist hotspot might have drastic changes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline said this week that it is considering ending its flights to Seoul because of an unsatisfactory performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has met with his counterparts from Qatar and Switzerland in Davos as he continued to promote Hong Kong's competitive edge on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan on Wednesday held talks with Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the Qatari finance minister, and Daniela Stoffel, state secretary for international finance of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They exchanged insights on the latest global economic and financial landscapes and discussed ways to enhance co-operation between Hong Kong and both economies in trade, financial services and infrastructure," according to a statement by the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also held bilateral meetings with government officials and business leaders from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He discussed strategies to "prevent a new, non-co-operative normal" with some 70 political and economic leaders, according to the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also told the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, that Hong Kong values taking part in the annual forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This platform offers an opportunity for Hong Kong to showcase its latest economic and social developments to global leaders, and the city's unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such participation also enables Hong Kong representatives to better understand international trends, exchange views with various economic and sectoral representatives, and present Hong Kong's perspectives."

    Safety questioned after Turkey hotel fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Anger was growing in Turkey on Wednesday as allegations piled up that negligence played a role in the deaths of 79 people who perished when a huge fire swept through a luxury ski resort hotel in northern Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the nation observing a day of mourning, grieving families began burying their dead as questions multiplied about fire safety measures at the 12-storey Grand Kartal Hotel perched on a mountaintop in the Kartalkaya resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in the dead of night, struck at peak season for the Grand Kartal Hotel, which had 238 guests staying at the start of a two-week winter break.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a funeral in the nearby town of Bolu for eight members of the same family who died in the blaze, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could be seen wiping away tears, his head bowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing foggy morning, with flags flying at half-mast, rescuers resumed their search of the charred and blackened structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those being buried was a neurologist, his wife and their three children, including twin boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out around 3:30am local time, sending huge clouds of smoke into the night air and sparking panic among the guests, many of whom tried to climb out of the windows, using bedsheets as ropes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw one kid hanging from the hotel window calling for help," said Islam, who works at a nearby hotel and did not give his surname.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was profoundly disturbed. I still cannot forget the image," he said, adding he knew some of the hotel staff who died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said nine people, including the owner, had been arrested in connection with the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Minister Nuri Ersoy said on Tuesday the hotel had two fire escapes and had passed inspections in 2021 and 2024. (AFP)

    PSG, Real Madrid secure vital Champions League wins

<img alt="Real Madrid celebrates after a goal against Austrian side RB Salzburg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788763_2_20250123073826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain pushed Manchester City to the brink of Champions League elimination after coming from two goals down to win 4-2, while Arsenal all but secured their place in the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holders Real Madrid remain in contention for a top-eight spot after sweeping aside Red Bull Salzburg 5-1, but Bayern Munich's hopes of automatic qualification took a hit with a 3-0 defeat by Feyenoord.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's City were left stunned as they blew a two-goal lead after Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland struck early in the second half in pouring rain at the Parc des Princes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Ousmane Dembele soon halved the deficit for PSG and Bradley Barcola equalised on the hour after Desire Doue's effort came back off the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Neves' diving header put PSG on top before Gonçalo Ramos added a late fourth as the French champions climbed from 26th in the table to 22nd and bumped City out of the qualifying spots for the knockout phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how we did it, to be honest," PSG coach Luis Enrique said after the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started the second half in the worst way possible by conceding two goals," he added. "It was tricky at that point, but at the same time this team believes in itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, the European champions in 2023, are down in 25th having failed to win any of their last four games in the competition and must beat Club Brugge at home next week to salvage their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept the defeat because the best team won," said Guardiola. "It's in our hands, we have to win the last game. Hopefully we can qualify. If it doesn't happen, we don't deserve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, holders Real Madrid got back on track in Europe with a 5-1 victory over RB Salzburg to ensure they will not be eliminated at the first hurdle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes struck twice each with French superstar Kylian Mbappé also on target in a ruthless display at the Santiago Bernabeu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side lost three of their first six games in a worrying start to the competition and will likely have to compete in the extra play-off round in February which is part of the competition's new format, unless they can scrape a top-eight spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory left Los Blancos 16th, a point behind Bayer Leverkusen in eighth, which is the final spot for direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian winger Rodrygo struck twice in the first half to help Madrid take control, with Mbappé netting soon after the break and Vinicius grabbing a brace of his own to bring up a century of goals for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy after reaching 100 goals with this shirt," Vinicius told Movistar, noting he was close to Brazilian compatriot Ronaldo Nazario's tally of 104.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to be able to continue like this and score a lot of goals, and mark an era in this team – that's my dream," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeats by Liverpool, AC Milan and Lille put Madrid under pressure ahead of their final two group matches and their Austrian visitors started with vim, pinning back Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid created little of note until Rodrygo's opener after 23 minutes changed the dynamic of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, in sensational form in recent weeks with eight goals in his last nine games across all competitions, finished neatly after Jude Bellingham nudged a cross into his path at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second goal was even better, set up by Bellingham with a brilliant backheel, which Rodrygo finished first time with a crisp curling strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so easy to play with Jude, he makes everything easy, the movements he makes, his second assist was very nice and I love playing with him," said Rodrygo.

  Elsewhere, Arsenal moved within touching distance of the last 16 after Declan Rice's goal in just 106 seconds inspired their 3-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have won five of their seven league phase matches, losing just once, and are almost certain to finish in the top eight, which secures automatic qualification for the last 16.

 Tech shares led US stocks higher on Wednesday following strong earnings from Netflix and a White House announcement that reignited enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netflix piled on nearly 10 percent after announcing price increases in several markets, including the United States, and revealing that its subscribers have topped 300 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of AI-linked companies such as Arm, Microsoft and Nvidia also advanced following a White House announcement of some US$500 billion in new AI infrastructure by Softbank and other tech giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.3 percent to 20,009.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 percent to 44,156, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, just under an all-time record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today was back to excitement over AI," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's session also included a trove of other corporate earnings reports, most of which topped estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Procter & Gamble climbed 1.9 percent as it reported higher profits and confirmed full-year targets for increased sales. The consumer products giant has seen improvement in China but emphasized that a complete turnaround will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seagate Technology, a data storage company also active in AI, jumped 6.8 percent after reporting a 50 percent jump in quarterly revenues to US$2.3 billion. (AFP)

    Prince Harry settles Murdoch tabloid lawsuit

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prince Harry settled on Wednesday his long-running lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's UK tabloid publisher, which agreed to pay him "substantial damages" after admitting intruding into his private life, including by hacking his phone.
 <br>
  <br>
  Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) issued a wide-ranging apology and admission of wrongdoing, in what Harry's lawyer David Sherborne called "a monumental victory" that underlined the need for further probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The publisher apologised to him for the impact of the "serious intrusion" into the private life of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, particularly when he was younger.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement won by King Charles's youngest son concludes a years-long legal battle over claims of unlawful practices by two of Murdoch's newspapers -- The Sun and now-shuttered News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also avoids a High Court trial in the public spotlight, which had been due to begin on Tuesday and last up to eight weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology... for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life," an NGN statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included the unlawful activities of private investigators working for the tabloid, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also apologised for the "phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information" by journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acknowledging the damage inflicted on Harry's "relationships, friendships and family", it said it would pay him "substantial damages". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guangdong have defended their title at the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition, after beating the SAR on aggregate following a 2-1 win on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Guangzhou a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg was played at the Hong Kong Stadium in front of thousands of home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first shot on target for Hong Kong, China came shortly after the kick-off, although Mahama Awal’s attempt from the box was comfortably saved by Guangdong goalkeeper Zhao Shi.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Guangdong who struck first, when national team player Behram Abduweli scored with a narrow angle shot in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got slightly heated after the goal, as Abduweli celebrated by taking off his shirt in front of the home crowd, triggering some Hong Kong fans to throw things at him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR side later suffered another blow when they had to make an early substitution after Awal got injured. Ma Hei-wai replaced him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the hosts responded swiftly after half-time as Lau Ka-kiu made a quick run into the box and to score an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team continued their attack and created multiple scoring chances, including a one-two play between Ma and Wu Chun-ming that led to a shot by Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Dalong put Guangdong ahead again in the 85th minute with a stunning header that caught Hong Kong goalkeeper Ng Wai-him off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad made a final effort to level the game in stoppage time, but captain Stefan Pereira’s free kick was again denied by the Guangdong goalkeeper.

 Border checkpoints will not operate beyond existing hours during the Lunar New Year period, the government announced on Wednesday.

  <br>
  Last year, Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay extending their operating hours over the festive period – something that officials decided not to do this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The government] has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances... and decided, in discussion with relevant mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the [border control points] during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries, and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also said around 8.67 million passengers trips in and out of the city are expected to take place over the eight-day Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday, with the majority of travellers passing through land border points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said banks have made preparations to deal with any risks posed by potential US trade tariffs and are closely monitoring developments.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing about the banking sector's performance in 2024, HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen noted that there's a lack of clarity in terms of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, you can expect that if the US imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then the global trade system will suffer and that would actually also impact on business outlook, " Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually asked our banks to stay on high alert on what's the impact of those, and to make sure the risk-management practices are fully in place for handling whatever is coming their way."

    More resources for banks to combat scams: HKMA

<img alt="Arthur Yuen, HKMA‘s deputy chief executive (center), says there's been a significant jump in the number of fraud cases locally. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788711_1_20250122190533.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said that it is allocating more resources to tackle financial and banking related frauds, following a surge in deception cases last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arthur Yuen, the authority’s deputy chief executive, said during a press conference that over 40,000 fraud cases were reported to the police in the first 11 months of last year – an increase of 8.7 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses incurred totaled HK$8.5 billion, meaning some HK$25 million were lost each day -- an amount Yuen said was "really concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen very important, serious cases of people losing their life savings simply because they have clicked on links or they have answered calls without caution," he said, adding that a new promotional campaign was launched to discourage people from clicking onto fraudulent hyperlinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspicious account alert system was also expanded last month for automatic teller machines to issue fraud alert over high-risk transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures, meanwhile, include a "Money Safe" tool that the authority hopes to make available in the first or second quarter of this year, to allow customers to lock all or part of their bank account balances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yuen said the city's banking sector posted the slowest profit growth in three years, with the aggregated pre-tax profit among 30 retail banks increasing by only 8.3 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the 62 percent annual growth registered in 2023.
