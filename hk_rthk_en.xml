    Ex-Cyclone Alfred sparks flood warnings in Australia

<img alt="Alfred has battered the coastline with gale-force winds that toppled trees. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794891_1_20250308152018.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Cyclone Alfred stalled off the rain- and wind-lashed coast of eastern Australia on Saturday, threatening to unleash floods after blacking out more than a quarter of a million homes and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former tropical cyclone – now downgraded to a tropical depression – has battered the coastline with gale-force winds that toppled trees, brought down power lines, and damaged buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was still creating heavy rainfall, swelling rivers in parts of a 400-kilometre stretch of the coast straddling southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales, government forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utility companies said 295,000 properties in southeast Queensland and another 42,600 in New South Wales were without power, warning that floods could hamper repairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the weather system "stalled and began weakening," the bureau of meteorology warned that intense rain and damaging wind gusts were a risk throughout the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rivers are already starting to respond to the heavy rainfall, with many Minor to Major Flood Warnings current," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man was missing after his four-wheel drive pick-up truck was swept off a bridge into a rain-engorged river the previous day in northern New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  He clambered out of the vehicle and tried in vain to cling to a tree branch in the river.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The man was swept from the tree and seen to go beneath the water where he has not been sighted since," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flooded roads and high winds made it too dangerous to send in crews or helicopters to search for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there were "grave concerns" for the man.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it has been downgraded, very serious risks remain so it is important that people do not take this downgrading as a reason for complacency," Albanese told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and indeed over coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders have been issued for 16,200 people in New South Wales, where 30 flood rescues have been carried out over the past 24 hours, emergency services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference the emergency was not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not over for the following reasons: The rivers are full. The rain is continuing and is expected to keep falling in the days ahead. And wind conditions are very high and extreme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Lismore – a northern New South Wales city hit by deadly floods in 2022 and a focus of concern in the past few days – the Wilsons River was no longer expected to spill over a 10.6-metre levee protecting inhabitants, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic Ginny Burke, 30, said she was at work when the wind uprooted a large gum tree that smashed through the house she is renting in Elanora on the Gold Coast in Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burke said she returned to her crushed home, where her sister recounted that she had heard the tree fall on Friday evening but described the calamity as "really unexciting."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What can you do?" the paramedic asked. "It's just stuff. Everyone's safe." (AFP)

<img alt="Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung says the government will study the Court of Final Appeal's judgement. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794875_1_20250308121459.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung on Saturday said the government will think about how to enforce the national security law better.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came after the Court of Final Appeal earlier overturned the convictions of three members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, for refusing to hand information over to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Cheung said the national security law is considered as a relatively new piece of legislation as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no precedent for law enforcement agencies to follow when carrying out the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung said the government will take the court’s view into account and think about how to improve the enforcement of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll carefully study the judgement handed down by the Court of Final Appeal. We will see how the judgement can further improve the law enforcement mechanism of the national security in Hong Kong,” Cheung said to reporters after attending the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I will say the judgement and the case law will contribute significantly to the development of jurisprudence of the national security law in Hong Kong,” he added.

    Catholics across China praying for Pope's recovery

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland Catholic bishop attending the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing on Saturday expressed hope for the speedy recovery of Pope Francis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, has been hospitalised for three weeks with pneumonia in both lungs. The Vatican on Friday said his condition remained "stable" after the pope delivered a weak and breathless audio message thanking well-wishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Fang, vice-president of the Bishops' Conference of Catholic Church in China and a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Catholics across the nation are praying for the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Great Hall of the People, Fang also noted he's been advocating for diplomatic relations between Beijing and the Holy See, though there's no timeline for when that would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican. We have repeatedly advocated for this at various meetings and occasions with leadership, and are actively working toward early diplomatic relations," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, the Vatican and China extended a deal over the appointments of Catholic bishops by another four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement was reached in 2018 and was renewed in 2020 and 2022, giving both sides the power to nominate candidates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country’s most senior judge has promised to take steps to counter unlawful sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jun, president of the Supreme People’s Court, also said on Saturday that authorities would equally protect the rights of state-owned, private, and foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will promote the development of a law-based economy and a credit economy, while strengthening foreign-related legal development and firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his report, Zhang noted courts at all levels, across the country over the past year have cracked down on crimes that seriously endanger social order, including penalising offences involving cross-border telecom scams in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have resolutely safeguarded national security and handed down punishment on offences such as subversion, separatism, and espionage, the top judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ying Yong, the country’s top prosecutor, vowed to safeguard national security and social stability in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said authorities would follow the principle that everyone is equal before the law, and handle every case with efficiency.

 Chief Executive John Lee praised the contribution of women to society and pledged that the government is committed to promoting women's rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks on Saturday at a reception held at government headquarters, celebrating March 8 - the International Women's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, women are the backbone of our society.  They include leaders, innovators, caregivers, change-makers and more. From boardrooms to classrooms, from workspace to marketplace, the women of Hong Kong continue to break barriers and inspire future generations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is dedicated to promoting gender equality and empowering women in every facet of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted since taking over office, he had established the Women Empowerment Fund and organised the first Family and Women Development Summit in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will work together with the Women's Commission to foster an inclusive, opportunity-filled Hong Kong for all women.

    New scheme aims to remove poorly managed buildings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's hope that a new scheme can help eliminate poorly managed, so-called "three-nil buildings" - which are blocks that lack owners’ corporations, property management services, or resident organizations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak says the joint building management scheme will involve the same property management company handling aged building clusters in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will act as a middleman to link property owners with professionals from NGOs who can advise them on finding the right management company.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will commence a one-year test in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, and Tsuen Wan later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Mak noted the project will help take care of aged buildings in the relevant areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Aside from the three-nil buildings, there are some aging, single-block buildings in old districts that only have 10 to 20 households. Even if they manage to form an owners' corporation, hiring a management company can be expensive as the cost can be too high for just a few units to share. So, in most cases they just choose not to set one up,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said the government has set aside HK$7 million for the project, with care teams and community NGOs helping to promote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that consultations have started in District Councils across the four districts and hoped that the project can commence by mid-year.

    'Hackman died of natural causes, a week after wife'

<img alt="Gene Hackman poses during the 60th annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. January 19, 2003. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794873_1_20250308114632.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife died of natural causes about a week apart, a medical examiner said on Friday, ending more than a week of mystery surrounding the death of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of "The French Connection" star and his wife were found on February 26 in their home in New Mexico after emergency services were called to their property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor," Heather Jarrell, the chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, aged 65 years, is hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither body showed any sign of trauma, nor any indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which had been an initial suggestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hantavirus presents as a flu-like disease, with symptoms including fever, muscle aches, cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure, Jarrell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This occurs after a one- to eight-week exposure to excrement from a particular mouse species that carries hantavirus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrell said data from Hackman's pacemaker showed its last activity over a week before his body was found when maintenance workers were unable to access the couple's sprawling Santa Fe property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hagman probably died around February 18. Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Miss Hackman passed away first, with February 11 being the last time that she was going to be alive," said Jarrell.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Betsy Hackman's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gene Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses nearby, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dog was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to autopsies, the investigation had focused on piecing together a timeline of the couple's last days, which detectives said had been complicated by their low profile and their preference for privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is perhaps best known as vulgar New York cop Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in the 1971 crime thriller "The French Connection", for which he won an Oscar for best actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won another golden statuette two decades later for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the brutal small-town sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett in the 1992 western "Unforgiven." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation’s top legislators on Saturday pledged to formulate and amend a slew of laws in the coming year, including one on backing private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments, at or above the county level, to provide regular progress reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Leji, who chairs the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), told a plenary meeting in Beijing that the law will be hammered out in parliament, as he outlined targets for the lawmaking body.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are also keenly aware that there are a number of gaps and shortcomings in our work,” said Zhao.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to further improve the quality of legislative work, and we should also step up our work in the emerging areas, and also fill in the short links in foreign-related legislation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting back this past year, the senior state leader said the NPC had strengthened the implementation of the Constitution, advanced a number of legislation, and enhanced foreign outreach.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Saturday announced that it will impose additional tariffs on some products imported from Canada based on the ruling of an anti-discrimination probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Effective from March 20, an additional 100-percent tariff will be imposed on imported rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas originating from Canada, while aquatic products and pork will be subject to an additional 25-percent tariff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes after the central government's anti-discrimination probe, which found that Canada's restrictive measures against some Chinese products have disrupted normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. (Xinhua)

    'HK can't stop residential and industrial land sale'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said Hong Kong is not in a position to stop selling residential and industrial land.
 <br>
  <br>
  In this year’s Budget, the government stated it wouldn't sell commercial sites in the coming year in light of the high office vacancy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pushed back against opinions saying that all land sales should be put on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Firstly, Hong Kong is eager to grow various industries. We want to make as much industrial land available for development as possible, so there’s no room to hold back. That goes against our strategy," she told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also won’t stop selling residential land. We have a solid plan in place, with a 10-year projection for how much land we need for public and private housing. This plan has been in play for several years, and we allocate based on this estimate every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Budget also proposed converting some commercial land into residential use, with locations including Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Tung Chung, Shek Mun, and Kowloon East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government will take various factors into consideration before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If the area is not designated as a core business area, I think there's more room to include more residential elements in it. We’ll also look at the office vacancy rates. Additionally, are there newly built commercial buildings? If there are, it suggests the supply is sufficient, so we have room for adjustment,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if the government is considering installment payments to encourage developers to bid for land, the development minister said they have an open mind toward large-scale land deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pointed out that each pilot zone in the Northern Metropolis could involve HK$10 billion to HK$20 billion in investment, adding that the administration will seek opinions from developers in the market sentiment survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tending process for the three pilot zones, located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole, will begin tendering work from second half of the year.

    Top-seeded Zverev crashes out in Indian Wells opener

<img alt="German Alexander Zverev in-between points during his match against Tallon Griekspoor. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794847_1_20250308081214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two and top seed Alexander Zverev was sent crashing out of Indian Wells on Friday as he was beaten 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, heading the field of the prestigious ATP Masters event with world number one Jannik Sinner serving a three-month drugs ban, is the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opener since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat in a tension-packed Stadium Court thriller continues a lackluster run for Zverev since he fell to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then the German had made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev saved five match points in a tension-packed 12th game of the third set, finally converting his fifth break point of the game to force the tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Griekspoor sealed it on his first chance in the decider, and the Dutch player was delighted to get it over the line against a player who beat him four times last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor next faces France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the 29th seed who was leading 6-4 when Hungrian Fabien Marozsan retired from their second-round match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev said the Italian's enforced absence had at first had him harbouring ideas of climbing to the top. But they are fading with his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible," said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opening match since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments," Zverev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten people died and hundreds were evacuated in the Argentine port city of Bahia Blanca on Friday as torrential rains flooded homes and hospitals, destroyed roads and forced authorities to cut the power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight hours of nonstop rain left the city of 350,000 people largely under water, and forced authorities to evacuate the Jose Penna hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed medical personnel evacuating babies from the hospital's neonatal unit, and the army was deployed to assist in rescue efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,000 people were evacuated to safety in the city about 600 kilometers south of the capital Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Municipal officials said ten people were confirmed to have died, but the toll could still rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city received more than 400 millimeters of rain in just hours - equivalent to what it normally gets in a year, "something unprecedented," according to Javier Alonso, security minister for the Buenos Aires province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest storm in Bahia Blanca was in 1930, with 175 millimeters. This is almost three times bigger," said Alonso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bahia Blanca's airport was closed until further notice, and officials cut off part of the power supply to reduce the risk of electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The provincial government said it was sending helicopters, canoes, ambulances and trucks bearing food, water and equipment to the stricken city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard was assisting in the rescue with inflatable boats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was raining, and suddenly we saw the street was flooded. About a meter-and-a-half of water came into my house," Flavia Viera Romero, who rescued her children from the deluge, told the LN+ channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city remains on alert from the meteorological service for new storms. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday after a roller-coaster session following mixed labor market data, concluding a losing week on a positive note.
 <br>
  <br>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said investors were reassured by a midday appearance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who described the central bank is in no hurry to shift course on monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When Powell came out with a calm and reassuring tone, it gave the market an excuse to rally," O'Hare said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,770, up 0.6 percent for the day but down 3.1 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 percent at 42,801, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7 percent to 18,196.
  <br>
  <br>
  US jobs data for February showed the country's economy added 151,000 jobs last month, up from January's revised 125,000 figure, but fewer than analysts estimates as unemployment ticked higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts described the report as unspectacular but good enough to suggest the labor market is not weakening precipitously.
  <br>
  <br>
  But O'Hare said investors are readjusting their views of the coming period in light of other disappointing economic reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is rethinking its growth outlook," he said. "Some of that is the tariffs. Some of that is the work around 'Doge'. Some of it is in the data itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Costco slumped 6.1 percent following disappointing earnings that sparked unease about the wholesaler's exposure to tariffs. Walmart also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Broadcom surged 8.6 percent after strong results boosted enthusiasm about the company's work in artificial intelligence. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Customs intensified enforcement at the international airport and uncovered multiple cases of illicit cigarette smuggling involving air passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Customs raided a suspected storage facility in Yuen Long, seizing approximately 6.7 million illicit cigarettes and 570,000 alternative smoked products, valued at an estimated HK$33 million, with a duty potential of HK$22 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Friday, Customs arrested a 36-year-old man outside a hotel in Tin Shui Wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was found in possession of 90,000 illicit cigarettes and 110,000 alternative smoking products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations revealed that the syndicate used air passengers to smuggle these items, which were stored in hotel rooms for further distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who claimed to be unemployed, faces charges and will appear in Tuen Mun Magistrate's Courts on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seized alternative smoking products will be handed over to the Department of Health for further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Customs intercepted 20 illicit cigarette smuggling cases at the airport, arresting 13 men and eight women.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 600,000 illicit cigarettes and 460,000 alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of HK$4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A follow-up operation at a Yuen Long logistics warehouse led to the arrest of a 44-year-old driver after the discovery of 6 million illicit cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was released on bail pending further investigation.

<img alt="Last month, Trump spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin about undoing sweeping sanctions imposed under former president Joe Biden. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794817_1_20250307225043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia over its bombardments of Ukraine, after previously suspending US aid to Kyiv in a stated bid to encourage diplomacy.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat comes after Russia launched major drone and missile attacks on Friday on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days earlier, the Trump administration suspended US military aid deliveries and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine after a dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Vice President JD Vance, on February 28, berated Zelensky in a televised meeting at the White House, accusing him of ingratitude for billions of dollars in US weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has since faced harsh criticism from allies and domestic opponents who say he has sided with Russia, which attacked Ukraine in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States voted with Russia and against its European allies on United Nations resolutions that called for ending the war without stressing Ukraine's territorial integrity.

 A high-level Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to advance efforts to prolong a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely paused hostilities with Israel, two senior Hamas officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The delegation will meet with Egyptian officials on Saturday to discuss the latest developments, assess progress in implementing the ceasefire agreement and address matters related to launching the second phase of the deal," said one official.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its talks with Egyptian mediators, the Hamas delegation will demand that Israel "implement the agreement, begin negotiations for the second phase, and open the border crossings to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian militant group seeks a "comprehensive agreement that ensures a permanent and complete ceasefire," the other official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hamas's demands for the second phase include a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, an end to the blockade, the reconstruction of the territory and financial support based on the decisions of this week's Arab summit in Cairo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire's first phase ended last weekend, after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the deal's second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken by Palestinian militants during Hamas's October 2023 attack, which started the war, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of passengers in Paris and London were stranded on Friday, after the discovery of a World War II bomb on tracks leading to the Gare du Nord station halted traffic at France's busiest railway terminus.
 <br>
  <br>
  All traffic to the train station, which serves international, high-speed and local connections, was halted as police worked to disable the device. All Eurostar trains in Paris were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unexploded bomb was found "in the middle of the tracks" about 2.5 kilometres from the station overnight during maintenance work carried out in the northern Paris suburb of Saint Denis, the national SNCF rail company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bomb "dates back to World War II," the RER B suburban train firm, whose trains from Gare du Nord heading towards Charles de Gaulle airport have also been suspended, wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gare du Nord station lies in the north of the French capital and is the country's busiest train hub, hosting the Eurostar trains in addition to regional and suburban service, according to the SNCF.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many passengers could not mask their irritation at the sudden change of plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting since 6:00 am for an RER to Goussainville," said 55-year-old Corinne Schiavenato, referring to a town north of Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to take a replacement bus but it's impossible, too many passengers, they're packed. I'm self-employed, I have a client who has been waiting for me since 7:00 am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others took the disruptions in stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's funny, I've just come back from Lorient where unexploded shells are discovered all the time," said Chloe Ternand, referring to a town in western France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot warned that rail traffic at Gare du Nord would remain "heavily disrupted all day" on Friday, which usually sees an increase in passengers due to weekend travel. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Friday that six more Hongkongers trapped in scam farms in Myanmar have been rescued in a joint operation by the Security Bureau and authorities from the mainland, Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the victims - three men and three women aged between 29 and 44 - had been held for five to seven months, after falling for job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Myanmar soldiers rescued them overnight and sent them to Thailand, adding that they are in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the victims are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Friday night, while the remaining person will stay in Thailand for at least one more day to assist with the ongoing probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a rescue operation, so we did not pay any ransom," the minister told reporters at the airport after returning from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "25 people, including these six, have returned, or will be returning to Hong Kong. The SAR government will spare no effort to rescue the remaining three people [trapped in Southeast Asia]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang was due to attend an event on Lantau on Thursday, but cancelled it at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he couldn't announce his trip because of the need to keep the rescue operation under wraps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also thanked Beijing officials from the Ministries of Public Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as authorities in Myanmar and Thailand for taking part in the mission.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's export growth grew slower than expected in the first two months of this year while imports fell sharply, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to customs data released on Friday, outbound shipments from China in January and February rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a gain of 10.7 percent in December and market expectations of a 5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slower pace was attributed partly to firms rushing out exports before the anticipated US tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports declined 8.4 percent year on year, after rising by 1 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the drop in imports of grain, iron ore and crude oil signalled that Beijing was scaling back on purchases of key commodities amid heightened tensions with the United States under  the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus for the two months came in at US$170 billion. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal scholar and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Albert Chen on Friday said the National Security Law can be amended, and that won't have retroactive effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after the SAR's top court overturned the convictions of three former members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Hong Kong government said it will study the ruling, review how it enforces national security laws, and look for ways to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK in Beijing, Chen said the Court of Final Appeal's ruling is reasonable and aligns with common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether changes are needed, he said Hong Kong's Committee for Safeguarding National Security is in charge of making rules for the National Security Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Laws can be amended at any time. Of course, these amendments won't have retrospective effect. But after the amendment, the court will need to make rulings based on the newly amended laws," the University of Hong Kong professor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This committee can decide to change the rules on its own without seeking approval from the National People's Congress, Chen added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court cancelled impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol's arrest warrant on Friday, paving the way for his release from jail following his arrest in mid-January on insurrection charges over a brief imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court said in a statement that its ruling was based on the timing of the indictment that came after the initial detention period had expired, and noted "questions about the legality" of the investigation process that involved two separate agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 15, Yoon became the first sitting president to be arrested on criminal charges after days of a standoff between presidential guards and arresting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision to cancel the arrest showed this country's rule of law is still alive," Yoon's lawyers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers also said he may not be immediately released because prosecutors can appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not immediately comment on the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence team had argued that a warrant issued on January 19 that extended Yoon's detention was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said his December 3 martial law declaration was needed to root out "anti-state" elements but lifted the decree six hours later after parliament voted to reject it. He has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks later he was impeached by the opposition-led parliament on accusations he had violated his constitutional duty by declaring martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court is expected to rule soon on his impeachment. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also noted the city’s economic recovery and its increased influence globally, Ma added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong; the head of Beijing’s liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong; and Minister of Science and Technology, Yin Hejun, were also present at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding met Hong Kong and Macau delegates of Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a day earlier.

    Good to improve NSL, Beijing official says

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China's diplomacy provides much-needed stability in a turbulent world.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference during the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang was asked about China's role in the world on the diplomatic front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's diplomacy will stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. We will provide certainty to this uncertain world. We will be a staunch force defending our national interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Global South, Wang said Beijing will continue to expand global partnerships and "write a new chapter of the Global South seeking strength through unity".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Global South, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's GDP, should strengthen themselves and strive for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  As China and the European Union mark 50 years of diplomatic relations this year, Wang said Beijing is still confident that Europe can be its trusted trading partner despite tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two sides have the capacity and wisdom to properly resolve pending issues through friendly consultation and jointly usher in another promising 50 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang accused the Philippines of creating frictions in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said trust and rules are needed to help bring lasting peace and security in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said the island is an inalienable part of China and any attempts to seek "Taiwan independence" are doomed to fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Taiwan has never been a country and will never be a country in the future,” Wang said, adding that China will realise complete reunification.

    Pope releases audio message thanking the faithful

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A weak and breathless Pope Francis thanked people for their prayers for his recovery in a remarkable audio message broadcast on Thursday, the first public sign of life from the 88-year-old pope since he was hospitalized three weeks ago with double pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis’ feeble voice, discernible through his labored breaths and in his native Spanish, was recorded from the hospital and broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square who had gathered for the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” he said, his soft voice piercing the hushed square.
  <br>
  <br>
  “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For anyone used to hearing Francis’ voice, which is often so soft it sounds like a whisper, the audio was an emotional punch to the gut that hammered home just how sick he is.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal presiding over the prayer, Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime, had told the crowd at the start of the service that he had “beautiful news, a beautiful gift" to share.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearly surprised crowd broke into applause and then applauded again after Francis’ final “Gracias.” Fernández Artime, for his part, bowed his head as he listened.
  <br>

    Smart traffic control system to be tested in Kwun Tong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they hope traffic congestion in Kwun Tong would be eased following the implementation of a new smart traffic management system in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, to be launched later this year, was co-developed with the University of Science and Technology’s Great Smart Cities Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received funding of HK$6.8 million from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau to develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes installing 11 sets of CCTV cameras across nine streets in Kwun Tong's business area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic data will be collected round the clock, analysed real-time through AI and shared by the police and the Transport Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the system can show vehicle flow on different days and in different periods, as well as give suggestions on traffic lights control.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, police chief inspector Terrence Yu said the collected data would not be used for enforcement and would be deleted after 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our idea was to use technology to better understand the traffic flow in the business area to provide us with the most appropriate arrangement. We won’t carry out enforcement based on the system, but we will make arrangements in areas like deployment of manpower based on the situation, and ask our colleagues to take appropriate traffic control measures,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu said the force does not have specific performance indicators and would review the system in future before considering whether to expand it to other areas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has ushered in a golden era to develop the so-called "low altitude" economy, or even a "sky city", according to delegates at the country's top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as the annual "Two Sessions" continues in Beijing, featuring delegates at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Yang Yi, a CPPCC delegate, who is also a senior technical expert at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, said the low-altitude economy is one example of "new quality productive forces", as it has vast potential to open up a new industry while reshaping the current sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has ushered in the golden period of developing the low-altitude economy, it is now the industry's 'take-off' period, and the low-altitude economy will become a new engine of China's economic growth, to spark new consumption trends," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The idea of building a city in the sky will no longer be simply a dream," she added, noting this year's key tasks include gradually opening up the nation's aerial space, enhancing regulatory frameworks and safety, continuing technological innovation, while encouraging market engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xu Xiaolan, a vice chairperson of the standing committee of the CPPCC National Committee, who is also the vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, said the country's internet-based industrial production had expanded to cover 49 economic fields, involving some 1.53 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, a computer scientist, who is also the former vice minister of the Industry and Information Technology of China, added the latest breakthroughs achieved by DeepSeek have also been applied to various sectors including the search engines, text generating, medicine, culture, and tourism.

    China will 'firmly counter' US amid trade row: Wang Yi

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will "firmly counter" US pressure on trade, after Washington imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a press conference on Friday on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang also raised the risk that the "law of the jungle" could take hold in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China-US economic and trade ties are mutual. If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move by the Trump administration to impose additional tariffs using the fentanyl issue as a pretext, Wang said Washington should not "repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose arbitrary tariffs".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are around 190 countries in the world," he said. "Imagine if every country emphasised their own priority and believed in strength and status, the world would fall back into the law of the jungle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Major countries should undertake their international obligations… and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the abuse of fentanyl in the US is a problem that must be confronted and resolved by the country itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of AI in China and growing popularity of DeepSeek, the foreign minister said "high fences and small yards" cannot suppress the spirit of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that China and the US must co-exist peacefully, and mutual respect is key to bilateral ties. (Agencies)

 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said ties with Russia were a "constant in a turbulent world" as he addressed the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A mature, resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be disrupted by third-party interference," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China supports a plan by Egypt and other Arab countries to rebuild and restore peace in Gaza. (Agencies)

    Second measles-related death in US in a decade

<img alt="Measles testing takes place amid an outbreak in Texas. File Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794679_1_20250307093051.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico resident who has died, tested positive for measles, the state health department said on Thursday, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in more than a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek medical care before death, and was the first measles-related death in the state in more than 40 years, according to David Morgan, Public Information Officer for the New Mexico Department of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death is still under investigation by the state medical examiner, Morgan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death brings to 10 the number of measles cases that occurred in Lea County, located adjacent to Gaines County, Texas, where more than 100 cases and one death in an unvaccinated child have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine sceptic, to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child had died of measles, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but downplayed the role of vaccines by telling parents vaccination was a personal choice and urging them to consult with their physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the role of vitamin A, overstating evidence for its use, which has only been shown to decrease measles severity in developing countries among individuals who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, said Dr Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of February 27, 164 measles cases have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in nine jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles typically kills 1 to 3 people per 1,000 cases, said Dr Tina Tan, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said two deaths out of a total of 164 cases suggest "a much higher mortality rate than we would normally see," adding that there are probably many undetected cases. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Trump listens as Rodolphe Saade, CEO of CMA CGM Group, speaks in the Oval Office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794675_1_20250307092145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday said French-based shipping firm CMA CGM would invest US$20 billion in the United States to build out shipping logistics and terminals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration wants to revive shipbuilding in the United States and weaken China's grip on the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's team is preparing an executive order that would impose a levy on ships linked to China when they call at US ports, and wants US allies to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM is the world's third-largest container shipping line and is part of a vessel-sharing alliance with companies including China's COSCO.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM said last week that US port fees on China-built ships would have a big impact on all shipping firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday he would announce a new program for building ships in the United States next week or the following week, including incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM CEO Rodolphe Saade, who joined Trump in the Oval Office, confirmed the US$20 billion investment and said it would create 10,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment over four years would include expansion of container ports and the creation of an air cargo hub in Chicago supported by five new Boeing 777 freighters flown by American pilots, CMA CGM said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saade, a French-Lebanese billionaire who controls CMA CGM with other family members, told Trump at the White House that his group was looking at supporting the building of container ships and would make an announcement "in the coming weeks".
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM operates port terminals in New York and Los Angeles. The Marseille-based firm is the biggest cargo carrier for US retail giant Walmart. (Reuters)

    Cyclone Alfred edges closer to Australia's east coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Violent winds toppled power lines on Friday as a tropical cyclone inched towards Australia's eastern coast, sparking evacuation orders and leaving more than 50,000 homes without electricity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 165 kilometres east of Brisbane city on Friday morning, crawling towards the densely-populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre stretch of coastline straddling the border of Queensland state and New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a region rarely troubled by typhoons - it has been more than 50 years since a tropical cyclone made landfall in that part of Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 50,000 homes were without power on Friday morning as damaging winds brought down power lines, officials and utility companies said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the storm already "packed a punch", warning conditions would get worse as it approached land late on Friday or early Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency response officials said they had issued evacuation orders for some 10,000 people in the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was particular concern for the town of Lismore, which was engulfed by record 14-metre floodwaters after heavy rains in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have spent the past three days fortifying their homes with sandbags, tying down loose furniture and stocking up on food and water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the region should "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred would likely cross the coast "early Saturday morning", the Bureau of Meteorology said, although its path was becoming difficult to predict.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was forecast to make landfall around 60 kilometres north of Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 900 schools across Queensland state and neighbouring parts of northern New South Wales were closed on Friday, education department officials said. (AFP)

    SpaceX loses contact with Starship rocket after launch

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX saw mixed results in the latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket on Thursday, successfully catching the massive booster but with the upper stage failing for the second consecutive time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minutes after lift-off and booster separation, a video live feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably, with signal soon cutting out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too," SpaceX official Dan Huot said, alluding to the January launch that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, raining debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new setback could fuel questions over Musk's attention to his space company, as the billionaire spends most of his time in Washington leading US President Donald Trump's government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  That work has also prompted mounted scrutiny over Musk's influence on the US government space program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful launch vehicle, successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas shortly after 5:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Starship's eighth orbital mission - all so far uncrewed - and the first since its dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing contact with the upper stage again, SpaceX managed to return the huge booster stage to the launch tower - catching it with arms called "chopsticks." It was the third time SpaceX completed the tricky engineering feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 minutes after the launch, Spacex turned off its livestream and the fate of the errant upper stage was not immediately known. (AFP)

    'Govt should seek new revenue streams amid deficit'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their retreat on Thursday, falling hard ahead of key US jobs data as markets shrugged off President Trump's latest moves to soften tariff actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, but the shift was not enough to spark a change in stock market activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down one percent at 42.579, after spending the entire session in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent to 5,738, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.6 percent to 18,069.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management said the uncertainty around trade policy is "affecting the real economy," dragging down consumer sentiment and business investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The longer that goes on, the more the economy slows," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again to boost the struggling eurozone, but suggested the easing could be nearing an end and warned of "rising uncertainty" amid massive German spending plans and US tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large tech firms were among the bigger losers Thursday, including Netflix, down 8.5 percent, Tesla, down 5.6 percent and Nvidia, down 5.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report for February. Weekly jobless claims figures released on Thursday were better than expected, while Wednesday's private payroll report from ADP lagged estimates. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United drew 1-1 away to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, while Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee drilled in from just outside the area to give United the lead on 57 minutes in San Sebastian, but Mikel Oyarzabal levelled from the spot after Bruno Fernandes was punished for a handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee cut a distraught figure after missing the decisive penalty in last week's FA Cup shootout loss to Fulham and has endured a testing first season at United, whose only remaining hope of silverware is in the Europa League.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored for the first time in Europe this term, unleashing a sharp low drive from 20 yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho's inviting pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ruben Amorim's side could not hold on to their advantage as Fernandes handled at a corner, with Oyarzabal confidently converting his spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andre Onana made two excellent saves to keep United level as Real Sociedad pressed for a winner, leaving the tie evenly poised ahead of next week's second leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt until the penalty we had control of the game and then I think the penalty changed a little bit the momentum," Amorim said. "I felt our team in the last 30 minutes were really, really tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take this stage to Old Trafford, and it's going to be a different game," he added. "The pressure is going to be on us in that stadium and we have to be ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Bergvall's first-half own goal condemned Spurs to defeat in the Netherlands, and it could have been worse for Ange Postecoglou's side were it not for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Rangers recorded an impressive 3-1 win away to a Fenerbahce team coached by Jose Mourinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyriel Dessers put Rangers ahead early on in Istanbul before Alexander Djiku hauled Fenerbahce level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaclav Cerny restored the lead for the Scots before striking again nine minutes from time to place Rangers in firm control under interim boss Barry Ferguson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon also took a big stride towards the quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory at Romanians FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Fonseca fought back tears as his players celebrated Nicolas Tagliafico's opener with him, a day after the Portuguese coach was banned from the dugout until November by French football officials after an angry altercation with a referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Fofana won the game for Lyon with two late goals after Alexandru Baluta had equalised for FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma host Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday, while Ajax are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Lazio travel to Viktoria Plzen for the first leg of their tie. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday underscored the role of education in advancing science, technology, and talent development, calling for deeper alignment with the country's modernisation needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a joint group meeting during the third session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi emphasised cultivating talent, maximising their potential, and integrating education with national priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called for comprehensive education reforms, including granting schools greater autonomy and improving governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the need to instill in students the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education must play a fundamental role in fostering innovation and self-reliant talent training, Xi said, calling for mechanisms to align education with economic and social development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the CPPCC's role in supporting national education and talent strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi on Thursday also extended festive greetings and best wishes to the country's women of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life ahead of International Women's Day, which falls on March 8. (Xinhua)

    Trump backs off Mexico, Canada tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that fresh tariffs targeting Mexico would not apply to trade that falls under an existing regional pact. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794641_1_20250307042023.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, providing some reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  After his sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on the two US neighbors took effect on Tuesday, stock markets tumbled, while economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed orders Thursday to delay fresh levies for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The halt, which lasts until April 2, came one day after the White House announced similar relief for automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with the "Big Three" US automakers Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, Trump decided to give a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy imports hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest moves make conditions "much more favorable for our American car manufacturers," Trump said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that major moves would be unveiled on April 2, the date that he has promised "reciprocal tariffs" to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum, which are due to take effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a "very good conversation" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks stood in sharp contrast to the simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for "the foreseeable future" even if there are "breaks for certain sectors." (AFP)

<img alt="Irish captain Caelan Doris will earn his 50th cap in Saturday's crucial match against France in Dublin. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794627_1_20250306222902.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish captain Caelan Doris is fit and will face France, handing a massive boost to Ireland ahead of their potential Six Nations title decider in Dublin on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old No 8, who missed the win over Wales last month owing to a knee injury, will win his 50th cap and is one of four changes to the starting XV from the Welsh match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fullback Hugo Keenan returns, as does prop Finlay Bealham, who was a replacement against the Welsh, and Bundee Aki comes in to partner Robbie Henshaw in the centres for the suspended Garry Ringrose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Caelan has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness," Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It says a lot about him that he has done as many other players might not have been able to do that in such a short space of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Osborne, who stood in for Keenan against Wales, moves to the wing as Mack Hansen has a thigh injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby said Osborne's versatility earned him the nod ahead of an out-and-out winger such as Calvin Nash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt it was right to give him (Osborne) the right wing as it gives us coverage across the backs due to his versatility," said Easterby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mack (Hansen) was touch and go, but he was comfortable with the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson-Park, who have been outstanding thus far, will form the half-back partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Conan, who started the Wales game instead of the injured Doris, has also recovered from a lower back problem and will be on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Bealham and Doris, Conan is set for his 50th Test appearance. (AFP)

<img alt="Only 4.5 percent of private flats were vacant as of end-2024, the government says. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794626_1_20250306222204.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to an S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

    World's sea ice cover hits record low in February

<img alt="In the Antarctic the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794625_1_20250306221837.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global sea ice cover fell to a historic low in February when the world continued to experience exceptional heat, and temperatures reached 11 degrees Celsius above average near the North Pole, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the third hottest February on record, continuing a run of persistent warming since 2023 stoked by greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Combined Antarctic and Arctic sea ice cover – ocean water that freezes and floats on the surface – dropped to a record minimum extent of 16.04 million square kilometres on February 7, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "February 2025 continues the streak of record or near-record temperatures observed throughout the last two years," said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs Copernicus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the consequences of a warmer world is melting sea ice, and the record or near-record low sea ice cover at both poles has pushed global sea ice cover to an all-time minimum."
  <br>
  <br>
  The poles are the most sensitive regions to climate change on the planet, warming several times faster than the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arctic ice cover, which normally expands to its annual winter maximum in March, was a historic February low last month, eight percent below average, Copernicus said. That marked the third monthly record in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Antarctic, where it is now summer and the ice is melting, the frozen cover was 26 percent below average across February, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Antarctic region may have hit its annual low point towards the end of the month, Copernicus said, adding that if confirmed, this would be the second-lowest daily minimum coverage in the satellite record. (AFP)

<img alt="Thursday's summit brings all 27 EU leaders together for the first time. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794604_1_20250306190444.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU leaders gathered with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday in Brussels in search of unity on bolstering Ukraine and Europe's defences, after US President Donald Trump upended traditional US alliances and retracted wartime backing for Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's summit brings all 27 EU leaders together for the first time since last week's explosive meeting between presidents Trump and Zelensky, with Washington since suspending military aid and intelligence sharing to help Kyiv fight Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has sent Ukraine's allies scrambling, with EU leaders openly questioning Washington's reliability as a security partner going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Brussels meeting will aim to cement European support for Kyiv, it is unlikely to yield any major announcements of aid beyond the 30 billion euros (US$32 billion) the bloc has already committed for this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of the United States pivoting from its European partners in Nato has fuelled a growing consensus on the summit's other major topic: the need to strengthen Europe's defences against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has laid out a plan aimed at mobilising 800 billion euros to "re-arm Europe" – largely by freeing states to spend much more – which leaders are expected to greenlight on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Europe faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us has seen in our adult lifetime," she wrote to leaders, urging Europe to "act as decisively as the situation dictates."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron doubled down in a sombre address to the nation on the summit's eve, calling for a defence spending surge to confront a "new era" and saying he would discuss extending France's nuclear deterrent to European partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Who can believe that this Russia of today will stop at Ukraine?" Macron asked. "I want to believe that the United States will stay by our side, but we have to be prepared for that not to be the case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, who conferred with EU chiefs in Brussels ahead of the talks, has likewise declared himself ready for "the worst-case scenario" and embraced radical reforms to ramp up Germany's defence spending.

  <br>
  Bolstering European defences has taken on acute urgency as Trump makes clear his desire to swiftly end the three-year war through direct negotiations with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  His embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, while expressing contempt toward Zelensky, has cemented fears that Kyiv and Europe's interests will be overlooked in any deal to end the biggest conflict on the continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for a "coalition of the willing" to come together to draw up a peace plan and present it to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer and other European leaders made a show of embracing Zelensky and reaffirming support for Ukraine at weekend talks in London. EU chiefs will be briefing Starmer on the Brussels talks on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Britain have pitched a one-month truce "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure", though not initially on the ground. Leaders are expected to raise that proposal in Brussels, but not formally decide on it.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders are also expected to start thrashing out what "security guarantees" the bloc might provide for a peace deal, including the possible deployment of European troops, which several states support.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Zelensky can expect strong words of support in Brussels, it was unclear if a deal would be reached on a new package of key weaponry, with several states arguing that Europe currently has enough money committed to meet Kyiv's needs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Thursday that Donald Trump's threats would encourage Israel to disregard the fragile ceasefire, after the US president said that unless hostages are freed, the people of Gaza would be "DEAD".
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's warning came hours after his administration revealed it held unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, which it proscribes as a "terrorist" group, focused on American hostages in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five Americans are believed to remain among the hostages – four have been confirmed dead and one, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed Israel was consulted and said in a statement that it "expressed its opinion" on the direct talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said later he was "sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job" as his administration expedites billions of dollars in weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you," he wrote on his Truth Social platform after meeting freed hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also warned of repercussions for Gaza as a whole, where virtually the entire population has been displaced by Israel's relentless military campaign in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said Trump's words pushed Israel to disregard the terms of a ceasefire in place since January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms," Qasim said in a statement, urging the United States to pressure Israel to enter the ceasefire's second phase. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Guangdong official on Thursday said the province will work closely with Hong Kong and Macau to host the National Games this year, and strengthen technological cooperation to build a world-class Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Hu, the executive vice-governor of Guangdong, made the remark at a plenary session of Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a first, the National Games will be hosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same meeting, Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong expressed his vision to welcome people from all walks of life for the quadrennial gala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to invite everyone to come and watch the Games in Guangdong and the Greater Bay Area ... to experience the rapid changes of Guangdong and the unique charm of the vibrant Greater Bay Area," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming, meanwhile, described the province's proximity to Hong Kong and Macau as a natural and unique advantage, adding the two SARs connect the region to the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang thanked both cities for their support and investment in Guangdong, saying their involvement is key to the Greater Bay Area's development.

<img alt="The MTR Corporation posts a net profit of HK$15.77 billion for 2024. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794580_1_20250306173403.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Thursday charged four people on suspicion of fixing matches in the Hong Kong football league.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three of the suspects were linked to Fu Moon Athletic Association, which currently plays in the Second Division, below the Premier League and First Division.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included 30-year-old defender Lo Hong-ming, who's also the owner and the coach, as well as 32-year-old midfielder So Chun-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Him-chun, a former Fu Moon player, was the alleged betting agent, while Yao Xiaocong was the alleged bookmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are due to appear in Eastern Court on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body alleged that 11 league and cup matches between the 2021-22 season were manipulated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo was accused of receiving HK$60,000 in bribes, while the three others allegedly offered HK$240,000 to other players in exchange for their cooperation on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said investigations were ongoing and warned of more arrests in the future.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

    Top court upholds sedition convictions of Tam Tak-chi

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court on Thursday upheld the sedition convictions of former activist Tam Tak-chi over a string of incitement incidents in public in 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal also maintained the former vice chairman of People Power's jail sentence of three years and four months for sedition and public order-related offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam's lawyers argued that the case should have been tried by a High Court jury, not the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the prosecutors should be required to prove the appellant had the intention to incite others to engage in violence or create a public disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the top court judges dismissed both arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said it was valid for a magistrate to transfer the case to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges also ruled that clauses of the old sedition laws didn't require proof of the intention to incite as an element of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They noted the crimes listed all came with an "or" rather than an "and", dismissing the lawyers' reliance on a clause that states it is only an offence when a person counsels "disobedience to law or to any lawful order".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The clause] constitutes only one of the various alternative forms of seditious intention each of which is capable of constituting the offence," the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam was prosecuted and jailed under the decades-old sedition laws, before the enactment of the local national security legislation under Basic Law Article 23.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

    'More transparent private healthcare charges needed'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says many private hospitals and clinics did not provide sufficient price information, resulting in a flood of complaints.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's consumer watchdog on Thursday called on various private healthcare service providers, including hospitals and clinics, to be more transparent when they disclose their fees, given complaints over unexpectedly higher medical costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received 191 complaints between 2021 and 2024, which were related to private medical care services, involving some HK$7.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of those complaints were due to disputes over fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council blamed the disputes partially on the lack of sufficient disclosures of fees by those private health care premises, adding a council study found that nearly 70 percent of patients surveyed encountered "price variations" when examining their bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final costs, in some cases, were HK$60,000 to HK$70,000 higher compared with the initial budget estimation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But about 65 percent of respondents did not get any explanation regarding the price difference, and about 39 percent reported receiving only verbal budget estimates without any written or detailed breakdowns of the chargeable items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the council pointed out the dramatically varied prices among the private premises also made it difficult for people to compare medical costs for the same treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  To tackle the issue, the watchdog urged private medical providers to disclose their price list online, and roll out more packaged treatment services with clear and detailed written prices for consumers to choose and compare.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

    Top court clears ex-Alliance trio over security probe

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three people for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled the trio, who were members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, did not have a fair trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Implementation rules under the national security law require suspects deemed to be "foreign agents" to hand over information to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were jailed in 2023 for four-and-a-half months each for refusing such a request about their former organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the top court found the evidence used by prosecutors to establish that the group was acting as a "foreign agent" was so heavily redacted that it was "self-defeating".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was self-defeating to have redacted out the only material relied on for establishing the foreign agent element of the offence, so that, in its absence, the charge could not be proved," the judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[D]epriving the appellants of all knowledge of the nature of the prosecution’s case... made it impossible for them to have a fair trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court therefore quashed the three's convictions and jail sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate security trial of inciting subversion involving Chow and two former Alliance leaders is still pending.

    Rare cyclone approaches Australian coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Early wind and rain from a rare tropical cyclone began lashing part of eastern Australia on Thursday as schools were closed, public transport was stopped and desperate residents got around shortages of sandbags by buying potting mix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early on Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The wind impacts, we’re already seeing those start to develop on the exposed locations along our coast with gusts reaching 80-90 kph. We are expecting those to continue to develop,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely-populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. More than four million people lie in the cyclone’s path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred was 280 kilometres east of Brisbane and moving west on Thursday with sustained winds near the centre of 95 kilometres per hour, and gusting to 130 kilometres per hour, Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to maintain its wind strength before hitting land.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the greatest fears are for the expected flooding over a wide area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modelling shows that up to 20,000 homes in Brisbane, a city largely built on a river floodplain, could experience some level of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 660 schools in southern Queensland and 280 schools in northern New South Wales were closed on Thursday as weather conditions worsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federal government had delivered 310,000 sandbags to Brisbane and more were on the way, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shortage of sandbags in Brisbane, a city of more than three million people, led some to buy sacks of potting mix as an alternative, according to Damien Effeney, a chief executive of a rural supplies business. (AP)
