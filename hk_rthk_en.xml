<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket blasted off on its latest test flight on Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever-closer ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevvy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red Maga hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4:00 pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with Nasa and the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-metre-tall stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonising Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" – a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa is also counting on a specialised version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk – perhaps inadvertently – disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelt catastrophe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialling new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload – a stuffed banana – and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" – or Doge, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.
  <br>
  <br>
  That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship programme, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous." (AFP)

    Guardiola set to extend stay as Man City boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola is set to extend his stay in charge of Manchester City by signing a one-year extension to his contract, the Athletic reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won six Premier League titles and the club's first ever Champions League since arriving at the Etihad in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach's current contract expires at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been speculation that Guardiola's time could be coming to an end with City facing an uncertain future due to an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's director of football Txiki Begiristain, a close ally of Guardiola, has confirmed his departure at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported that the 53-year-old will pen a one-year extension to his deal with the option for another year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola also signed his two previous contract extensions at City during the November international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions return to action on Saturday, looking to snap an unprecedented losing streak for their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has lost four consecutive games for the first time in his coaching career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hit by the loss of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri to a season-ending knee injury, City have fallen five points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after defeats to Bournemouth and Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also lost 4-1 to Sporting Lisbon in their last Champions League outing and were eliminated from the League Cup by Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won 15 major honours in total during his eight full seasons in Manchester, which also includes two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Club World Cup and one Uefa Super Cup. (AFP)

    Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 end higher after early weakness

<img alt="Wall Street finished mixed ahead of Nvidia results on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779983_1_20241120052411.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks shrugged off early weakness amid the worsening Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday and finished mostly higher ahead of Nvidia results.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent much of the early going on the back foot, as Russia threatened major retaliation after Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, a nuclear threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin unsettled investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices later pushed into positive territory, with the Nasdaq finishing at 18,987, up 1.0 percent
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 5,916, while the Dow Jones declined 0.3 percent to 43,268.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of on our own continent over here," Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners said of the US investor mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In time, we would be impacted by an escalation of tensions. But today we're going to shrug that off, because tomorrow we get Nvidia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence star Nvidia piled on nearly five percent ahead of results on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other tech giants also advanced, Netflix and Tesla winning at least 1.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart rose three percent as it lifted its full-year forecast on higher profits. Walmart's US business, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenues, enjoyed a solid 5.3 percent gain in comparable store sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lowe's dropped 4.6 percent as it lifted some of its full-year projections. However, the home-improvement retailer still expects full-year comparable sales to be down at least three percent in 2024. (AFP)

 Hong Kong on Tuesday beat Mauritius 1-0 in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The win guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's earlier loss to Chinese Taipei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory also means new head coach Ashley Westwood is the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.

    Macau's made good progress over the years: Ho Iat-seng

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau’s outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, on Tuesday said he’s basically accomplished all of the promises set out in his election manifesto five years ago, adding that the gaming hub has made great strides in many areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters for the first time since his announcement not to seek re-election, Ho said his administration had to overcome many challenges during his five-year tenure – including the Covid pandemic that lasted three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, he said Macau's economy expanded and measures were also put in place to better safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the stress and a prolonged lack of rest over the years had taken a toll on his health, and he believes it's now time to pass the baton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also confirmed that the Macau government will continue to dish out MOP 10,000 to permanent residents and MOP 6,000 to non-permanent residents next year, saying his successor, Sam Hou-fai, agrees with the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the outgoing Macau CE noted that he hopes Macau and Hong Kong can continue to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Macau has always been learning from Hong Kong, saying the city has made substantial progress in areas like finance, maritime and aviation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Hong Kong's development as a mega events hub, Ho said people should not see the two SARs as rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Hong Kong and Macau has the vibe for mega events. We are developing this together... We invite different international singers to perform, and both places have the vibe to host concerts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next term of the Macau government should also work closely with Hong Kong because the relationship between the two places is very good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho's successor, former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai, is due to take office on December 20.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ruthless Japan moved to the brink of qualifying for their eighth straight World Cup after beating China 3-1 away from home on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Headers from Koki Ogawa and Ko Itakura put runaway group leaders Japan two goals up at half time before Lin Liangming pulled one back for China early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa snuffed out China's hopes of a comeback with his second of the game six minutes later in front of a vociferous crowd of 45,000 in Xiamen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were playing their first senior international in China in nine years and there is a long history of rivalry between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a heavy police presence outside the Xiamen Egret Stadium, where around 750 Japan fans were expected to be in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loud booing greeted the Japanese national anthem before kick-off and the game was briefly stopped in the first half when a fan invaded the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win gave Japan five wins and a draw in Asian qualifying Group C and took them to within touching distance of a place at the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two teams in each of the three groups will reach the showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan are at home to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in their next fixtures in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China gave a much-improved performance after losing 7-0 to Japan in Saitama in their opening group game.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have six points from six games and are still in the hunt for a place at their first World Cup since 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan made several changes to the team that beat Indonesia 4-0 in Jakarta on Friday with Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma and Crystal Palace's Daichi Kamada among those dropping to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa opened the scoring in the 39th minute, planting a firm header past goalkeeper Wang Dalei direct from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan doubled their lead just before the half-time whistle and again it came from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Koki Machida flicked on Junya Ito's delivery and Itakura was unmarked at the back post to nod the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  China found the perfect reply to start the second half when Lin pulled a goal back for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie Wenneng cleverly dummied Wei Shihao's pass and Lin slotted the ball past goalkeeper Zion Suzuki.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's joy lasted just six minutes before Ogawa headed in another Ito cross to restore Japan's two-goal cushion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled all typhoon signals at 10.10 pm on Tuesday as Man-yi continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T1 signal was issued on Monday morning and had been in force for well over 30 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also noted that water level is expected to rise on Tuesday night and warned that minor flooding may occur in low-lying coastal areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the water level of the coast of Hong Kong will rise higher than normal tonight," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From around 10pm tonight to midnight, a high water level of near 3 metres above Chart Datum is expected in Victoria Harbour, and a high water level of about 3.1 metres above Chart Datum is expected at Tai O."
  <br>
  <br>
  People are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on the alert.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that anyone who intends to endanger national security will be punished in accordance with the law, after 45 opposition figures were sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lee said the court decision reflects the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence shows the court confirmed that the offence of the defendants was extremely serious and they should be severely punished,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE stressed Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law, and offenders must be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those involved acted under the guise of democracy and freedom to subvert the political regime of the HKSAR… This case shows that anyone who intends to subvert state power and endanger national security will ultimately be punished in accordance with the law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman, meanwhile, called on foreign governments to stop interfering in SAR affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government has noticed that the United States and some Western countries, anti-China organisations, anti-China politicians and foreign media have recently made malicious attacks and smears on various cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR government has stated on many occasions that like all cases, this case was handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law.”

 Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian defence ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither side's claims could be independently verified. (AP)

    British farmers protest against inheritance tax

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British farmers massed in London on Tuesday, calling on the Labour government to scrap plans to change inheritance tax rules for land ownership, which they say threatens the agriculture sector and food production.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tractors with banners calling the move "the final straw" for the beleaguered sector drove around Parliament Square, while farmers lobbied lawmakers and others called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration to think again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've brought thousands of farmers to London to explain to the government that farmers are food producers, and this ludicrous budget is going to put us all out of business," farmer Olly Harrison told AFP from the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Farmers just simply will pack up... it's just too much for us -- we've just had enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although on a smaller scale, the demonstrations are reminiscent of protests when an earlier Labour government incensed rural communities in the early 2000s with a plan to ban foxhunting with dogs in England and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, countryside campaigners estimated that 400,000 people marched through London to oppose the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Farmers Union president Tom Bradshaw, said the latest protests would continue for as long as it takes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They (the government) cannot have a policy in place which has such disastrous human impacts and think we're going to go quiet," he told Sky News television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bradshaw met Environment Secretary Steve Reed on Monday and said afterwards he had shown a "level of understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  But both sides appear to be digging in, as the new Labour government tries to claw back what it says is a £22-billion (US$28-billion) blackhole in public finances left by the last Conservative administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In France and other European countries farmers have also been protesting over increased pressure on their revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Central to the row in Britain, where farmers have been struggling due to lack of funding and post-Brexit labour shortages, is how farms could be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farming businesses previously qualified for 100-percent relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property, reducing the amounts that farmers and landowners pay when farmland is passed on after a death.
  <br>
  <br>
  From April 6, 2026, however, total exemption from death duties will only apply to the first £1 million (US$1.27 million) of combined agricultural and business property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any estate valued above that will have to pay a 20-percent tax rate -- half the standard applied to other land and property -- over 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government maintains the actual threshold before paying inheritance tax could be as much as £3 million (US$3.8 million), once exemptions for each partner in a couple and for the farm property are taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Monday "the vast majority of farms" will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the NFU insists that more farms may have to pay the tax when land, property and equipment are taken into account. It points to environment ministry figures that show that 66 percent of farm businesses in England have a net value of more than £1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our numbers suggest that 75 percent of commercial farms, those farms producing this country's food, are caught in the eye of this storm," said Bradshaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farmers fear the financial burden will force farms to be broken up and sold as result of the policy, hitting food production and supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,800 farmers lobbied MPs in London on Tuesday, winning support from the opposition Conservative party. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour "clearly doesn't understand or care about rural communities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tim Farron, environment spokesman for the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats, said direct agricultural subsidies had fallen by 20 percent in real terms since 2015, and 8,100 farms were lost across the country in 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major EU countries are ready to provide defence and financial aid to Ukraine if the United States reduces support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking on the 1,000th day of the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as foreign ministers from six major European countries held talks in Warsaw dominated by the war and Donald Trump's return to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top diplomats from France, Germany, Italy and Poland joined the meeting, while Britain's David Lammy and Spain's Jose Manuel Albares took part by video.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I note with appreciation the readiness of the largest European Union countries to assume the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the context of a possible reduction in US involvement," Sikorski told reporters after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warsaw gathering followed a meeting of all EU foreign ministers in Brussels and comes as Trump's return to the White House threatens a drastic change in US policy nearly three years into the Russian attack on Ukraine. (AFP)

    Rape victim Gisele Pelicot condemns machoism

<img alt="Gisele Pelicot arrives at the courthouse for the trial of her former partner Dominique Pelicot. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779937_1_20241119194127.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gisele Pelicot, the French woman drugged by her ex-husband so she could be raped and sexually abused by him and dozens of strangers, said on Tuesday that it was time for a "macho" society to change its attitude on rape.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivialises rape changes," said Gisele Pelicot in her closing statement at the trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men on rape charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time we changed the way we look at rape," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since early September her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot has been in the dock in the southern city of Avignon along with 49 other men. Another defendant is still at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has become a feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele, 71, said the marathon hearings marked a trial of "cowardice" on the part of the men who took part in the rapes organised by her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen people take the stand who deny rape, and some who admit it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to say to these men: at what point did Mrs Pelicot give you her consent when you entered the room? At what point do you become aware of this inert body? At what point do you not report it to the police?"
  <br>
  <br>
  None of her abusers alerted the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can hear this gentleman saying 'a finger is not rape'," Gisele Pelicot added, in reference to testimony from another defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have counted around 200 instances of rape, most of them by her husband and more than 90 by strangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele said her former husband "had a lot of fantasies that I couldn't fulfil".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But why did it come to this? I think what he wanted was Mrs Pelicot and not someone else," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I didn't want to go to a swingers' club, he thought he'd found the solution by putting me to sleep."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost 10 years of my life that I'll never make up for," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This scar will never heal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial enters its final stages this week. Dominique Pelicot was also set to address the court before the civil parties' deliver their closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are then scheduled to give their closing arguments and make their sentencing demands for the defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the couple's three children spoke in court of their heartbreak and grief, with the daughter insisting she has been "forgotten" despite being also abused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's daughter, who uses the pen name Caroline Darian, believes she was also assaulted by her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case of 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot has sparked horror, protests and a debate about male violence in French society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot has confessed to being a rapist. If convicted, he would emerge from the historic trial with a record as one of France's worst sex offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the co-defendants, only 14 have admitted the charges of aggravated rape, for which most of them face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35 others deny having raped Gisele Pelicot and maintain that they thought they were taking part in sex games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him in their home in the village of Mazan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has said that for years she had strange memory lapses and other health problems and thought she might have had Alzheimer's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many hope that the trial will help victims of sexual violence to finally be listened to and believed, and lead France to inscribe the notion of consent into the definition of rape in French law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One for all," French daily Liberation said on Tuesday, putting a picture of Gisele on its front page and calling the trial "historic."
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict is expected to be delivered by December 20 at the latest. (AFP)

    Power tariffs to climb by almost one percent in 2025

<img alt="Secretary for Environment Tse Chin-wan says the city's two power firms will raise their electricity tariffs by less than one percent on average next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electricity will cost slightly more for Hongkongers next year, with tariffs rising by 0.9 percent on Hong Kong Island and 0.98 percent in Kowloon and the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's two power firms, CLP and HK Electric, said even though fuel costs stabilised this year, ongoing geopolitical tensions meant they had to take on a more cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Electric noted that it also needs to pump in extra resources to further boost service reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To handle more frequent extreme weather conditions, we need to improve our infrastructure so that we can still deliver reliable electricity to our customers even during bad weather. Also, we need to update our old and outdated facilities. All these investments will put pressure on electricity prices," its managing director Francis Cheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CLP's managing director, Joseph Law, pointed out that the company is dealing with challenges like inflation, rising material costs, and a tense labour force -- all of which are driving up its operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand that people are concerned about electricity prices, and we will keep working to improve our operating efficiency by managing our finances wisely and controlling expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While international fuel prices have stabilised somewhat over the past year, geopolitical risks remain, and global fuel costs are still relatively high, so the outlook isn’t too bright. We’ll continue to take a careful approach in managing our expenses."
  <br>
  <br>
  A climate economist said while the increases this time around are in line with estimations, he expects the tariff hikes to exacerbate in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the international perspective, I would say there is still uncertainty about the fuel cost, especially the fluctuation in oil prices that might affect the future natural gas price. I think we should pay more attention," William Yu, CEO of World Green Organisation, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers also raised concerns about the SAR's reliance on imported fuels, and urged the administration to speed up plans to find alternative energy supply sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment secretary Tse Chin-wan said in response that the government has been negotiating with mainland officials about boosting its zero-carbon energy supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there's land set aside in Tseung Kwan O for receiving nuclear power and the project is scheduled for completion by 2035.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says foreign criticism of court sentences handed down on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far tramples on the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, spokesman Lin Jian said no one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape legal punishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also said Beijing firmly supports Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consulate in Hong Kong said Washington strongly condemns the sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia said it was gravely concerned about the fate of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng, who was jailed for seven years and three months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it expects mega events in the first half of next year to attract 840,000 tourists, a 50 percent rise when compared with the same period this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officials said there will be more than 90 mega events in the first half of 2025, including festivals, conventions and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the events are expected to generate total spending of HK$3.3 billion, which would be a 40 percent increase compared to the first half of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the cancellation of events due to poor weather conditions, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government will have better arrangements by learning from the mainland and creating back-up plans for events like drone shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for some of the shows, the original plan was to have 2,000 drones in a show, and they lowered the density to around 400. This allowed the show to continue to be carried out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will learn from them, so for some of the shows in the future, that will be one of the alternative options that we will prepare for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said it is inevitable that outdoor events such as the cross-harbour swim run the risk of being affected by the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted that tourists might feel disappointed with the cancellation of events, but dismissed worries that Hong Kong's reputation as a mega events hub could be damaged.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the sentences handed down on Tuesday in the city's largest national security case to date reflected the severity of the offence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the High Court court sentenced 45 people for conspiracy to commit subversion, Tang also told reporters that the government will look into individual cases before deciding whether to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think different people may have different judgements about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, eight others, including former lawmakers James To and Roy Kwong, are currently on bail after they were arrested three years ago for participating in the unsanctioned Legco primary aimed at bringing down the government. They have yet to be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every case, if we have sufficient evidence, we will arrest and we will prosecute," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong told RTHK that the sentencing reflected the application of common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One can see that the sentencing may not be as severe as a lot of people originally think, but it has its basis by reason of the fact that the court is effectively sentencing these defendants according to common law principles," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One must still remember that we are talking about serious crimes... A conspiracy crime may simply involve a situation where the crime has yet to be committed. Nevertheless from the sentencing, one can see that the court will treat it seriously and I think people should be aware of this."

    'Govt to carefully review bus fare increase requests'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung on Tuesday said the government will carefully review fare increase requests from bus operators before making any decisions.
 <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus are asking for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wants to put fares up by 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ll consider several factors, starting with how the public feels about it and the bus companies’ financial figures. We’ll also look at the services the bus operators offer. We will strictly play our gatekeeping role," Lam told reporters after attending a transport event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that officials will gather opinions from legislators and the general public as well as the Transport Advisory Committee, based on the existing mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legco's panel on transport is set to begin discussions on the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lam also said implementing time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel would be one of the many viable options when the government takes control of the infrastructure in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to present Legco the amendments to the tunnel's regulations by the end of this year and promised that the tunnel's tolls will be much lower than they are now.

<img alt="The court hands down jail sentences of at least seven years to Owen Chow, Gordon Ng and Gwyneth Ho." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779873_3_20241119164309.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of the defendants in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date received the heaviest sentences among those considered "active participants" in the scheme aimed at bringing down the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow was given a jail term of seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng was jailed for seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho got seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan pointed out that Chow, 27, was one of the initiators of a pledge relating to the scheme, which "certainly pointed to the fact that [Chow] was putting every effort in binding the participants to ensure its success”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was already jailed over a riot case, and Tuesday's sentence will be served consecutively because the judges ruled that they were "separate and distinct incidents".
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Ng, who had also pleaded not guilty, the judges said the 46-year-old "willingly and intentionally" facilitated the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was exemplified by the fact that he placed a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily on 3 July 2020 urging candidates who lost in the Primary Election not to participate in the LegCo election and asking people not to vote for anyone who had not participated in the Primary Election,” the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, meanwhile, was the only defendant who did not submit mitigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She had pleaded not guilty as well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stress test will be conducted at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Saturday, with the police saying the aim is to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five hundred members of the public will take part, along with 4,500 civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Ng Tsz-fai said tests will cover ticket inspections, security checks, designated seating arrangements, emergency response, crowd control and MTR passenger flow management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drill team will... test the security inspection procedures and simulate emergencies to evaluate the collaboration capabilities between various departments. This is the first time that there will be five thousand people and designated seating, so we can test the time required for entry and the clarity of instructions," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the first exit test will begin at 5pm, with participants divided into groups of 1,000 and walking from the stadium to Sung Wong Toi Station. A second test will follow shortly afterwards, with participants walking to Kai Tak Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR's Chief of Operating and Metro Segment Cheris Lee said trains will operate as usual, but there will be one-way only walking arrangements at the two stations during certain times.

    Sentences based both on NSL and common law, court says

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court says the prison sentences it handed out on Tuesday in Hong Kong’s largest national security case so far were based not only on the 2020 National Security Law (NSL), but also on common law principles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forty-five people were given prison terms ranging from four year and two months to ten years for conspiracy to commit subversion, in relation to their involvement in unauthorised primary polls that were found to be part of a wider plot to seize control of the legislature and ultimately to overthrow the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, questions were raised as to whether the defendants should be sentenced according to the penalties laid out under Article 22 of the NSL, which makes no mention of the offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article mandates prison sentences of between 10 years to life in prison for those deemed “principal offenders”, three to 10 years for “active” participants, and lesser penalties for “other participants”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court decided that while the penalty banding is of “reference value, [it] should not be strictly applicable.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said they also made reference to the common law offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, the starting points of the custodial sentences the court meted out to all defendants ended up being in line with the penalties mandated under Article 22 of the NSL.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When the court assessed the seriousness of the circumstances of the case, the prime focus was on the offender’s acts, as well as the actual consequences, potential risks and possible influence entailed”, the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stressed that the defendants were not sentenced for any acts prior to the enactment of the NSL in 2020, and no mainland sentences were used as a reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench also rejected arguments that the scheme was doomed to fail and the defendants should be given lighter sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government,” they wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this case, candidates for the primary election were essential [characters] of the scheme, without them, the scheme simply could not get off the ground. They lent their support to and actively participated in the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench added: “Had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government of the [Hong Kong SAR].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the four “principal offenders”, 41 other defendants were deemed "active participants” by the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, jailed activist Owen Chow was jailed for seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng received a jail term of seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho was imprisoned for seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, as well as ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu, were each sentenced to six years and nine months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another defendant, former student activist Joshua Wong, was slapped with a jail term of four years and eight months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court reduced his sentence by one-third for his guilty plea, but said it “did not consider him to be a person of good character” given his criminal records.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It should be noted that [Wong] committed the present offence while he was on court bail," the court said. “We did not think we should give further reduction because [Wong] could not have all the offences sentenced in the same proceedings. The sentence we passed on [Wong] also would not have a crushing effect on him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who were given the lightest sentences of four years and two months are former lawmakers Jeremy Tam and Claudia Mo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding Mo, the judges said they were “sympathetic to the ailing health” of her husband, Philip Bowring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, the health condition of [Mo’s] husband is not a matter that can militate against the sentence to be passed on [Mo],” the judges said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some defendants were given sentence reductions after saying they didn’t know they were breaking the law when taking part in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As to those who pleaded ‘ignorance of the law’ as mitigation, we were satisfied that they might have been misled by [Benny Tai] into thinking that the scheme was not unlawful”, the judges said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?

    <br>

    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.

    <br>

     </div>
     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

    Thousands march in NZ Maori rights protest

 Booming Indigenous Maori "haka" chants rang out across New Zealand's capital on Tuesday, as tens of thousands rallied against a conservative push to redefine the nation's founding treaty.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 35,000 demonstrators poured into the city of Wellington, police said, shutting down busy streets as their spirited procession inched its way towards parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks were joined by horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children marched alongside adults bearing distinctive full-face Maori "moko" tattoos and clutching ceremonial wooden weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vibe is beautiful. People of all walks are here to support. It is peaceful and respectful," participant Nick Stewart told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests have been swelling throughout New Zealand after a minor party in the conservative coalition government drafted a bill to redefine the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the bill has almost no chance of passing, its mere introduction has triggered one of New Zealand's largest protests in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many critics -- including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers -- see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's 900,000 strong Maori population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stand here gathered in our tens of thousands on the steps of parliament to protest this bill for our mokopuna," said Stewart, using a Maori word for future generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds gathered on the lawns outside New Zealand's beehive-shaped parliament building, playing reggae music and giving speeches that urged the government to come out and face them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties," said Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many demonstrators arrived in Wellington after a nine-day "hikoi" -- or protest march -- that began hundreds of kilometres away at New Zealand's northern tip. (AFP)

    Tai, three others named 'principal offenders'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In handing down sentences for subversion to 45 opposition figures on Tuesday, the High Court named four of them as "principal offenders", with former legal academic Benny Tai deemed as the initiator of an unofficial legislative primary election in 2020 aimed at overthrowing the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai received the heaviest jail term of 10 years among all defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three presiding national security judges – Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan – considered a starting point of 15 years behind bars for Tai, and reduced that by one-third after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “​​In short, [Tai] was not only the initiator of the scheme, but also an organiser of the primary election… He was the mastermind behind, hence could well be placed in the ‘[principal] offender’ category,” the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Tai] might not be the one standing in the primary election or the actual Legco election, he however provided the necessary platform for those who intended to exercise the vetoing power under the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin and former district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were also named “principal offenders”.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had pleaded guilty and become prosecution witnesses in the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio received jail sentences of six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  With starting points of 12 to 15 years in jail, the judges said the three had their sentences reduced for assisting the prosecution in the trial, as well as other mitigation factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng says Hong Kong must enhance its status as an international financial centre to fast-track the country's development as a financial powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering a speech at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit on Tuesday, he said Hong Kong has a pivotal role to play, with its robust financial system, growing appeal to investors and sound capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in Hong Kong. We will continue to expand mutual market access between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas such as stocks, bonds, financial management and interest rate swaps," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve the mechanism for the regular issuance of treasury bonds, steadily upscale the issuance in Hong Kong and support Hong Kong in consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the central authorities will continue to support Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, enabling them to expand and enhance the city's financial development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to deepen financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, and take forward the interfacing of rules and mechanisms between mainland cities in the GBA, Hong Kong and Macau in order to create more room for financial development in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The general principle is that so long as it is conducive to the plan of the central authorities, to the financial reform and development of our country and to the development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will explore and implement it."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he hopes Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages, being backed by the motherland while connecting to the world, and will seize opportunities from the country's deepening reforms and Chinese modernisation while dovetailing with the national development strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this will help Hong Kong contribute to high-quality national development, exemplifying the One Country, Two Systems principle on its journey.

<img alt="The defendants were jailed in a hearing held at West Kowloon Magistracy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779833_1_20241119105720.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forty-five people on Tuesday were sentenced from four years and two months to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion in the city's largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty and 14 others were convicted in May for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court sentenced former legal academic Benny Tai, who it said “advocated for a revolution” and masterminded the scheme, to 10 years in prison as a principal offender under Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL).
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others who were also deemed to be principal offenders for their roles in organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll related to the conspiracy – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, along with ex-district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were given jail terms ranging from six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 41 others were all ruled to have been "active participants" in the plot, with the heaviest sentences meted out to Owen Chow – who was jailed for seven years and nine months – and Gordon Ng, who got seven years and three months. The lightest sentence given was four years and two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the sentences, national security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan stressed that "had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the Government of the HKSAR."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether the scheme would ultimately succeed, it was not for this Court to speculate," they added. "What we were sure was that all the participants had put in every endeavour to make it a success."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed that while the court looked into things that happened before the NSL was enacted on July 1, 2020 to assess the seriousness and extensiveness of the conspiracy, none of the defendants were actually sentenced for any acts they committed during this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, they remained willing parties to that agreement and continued their participation in the scheme after it had been rendered criminal by the NSL”, they noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the 47 defendants were acquitted earlier.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies on Monday issued a joint statement highlighting the suffering caused by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, while calling for cooperation on climate change, poverty reduction and tax policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  G20 leaders meeting at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for a two-day summit tackled an agenda that reflected a shifting global order, trying to shore up multilateral consensus before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, leaders at the summit were able to reach a narrow consensus on the escalating Ukraine war, focused succinctly on "human suffering" and the economic fallout of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders' statement also expressed "deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip," and called urgently for more aid and protection for civilians along with a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit, and Moscow was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took marathon negotiations over the weekend for diplomats to finalise the joint statement, with debate over climate policy stretching into the dawn hours of Sunday, according to people involved in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their statement, leaders agreed the world needs to reach a deal by the end of the United Nations Cop29 climate change summit in Azerbaijan on a new financial goal for how much money rich nations must provide to poorer developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cop29 officials had called on the G20 leaders for a strong signal to help breach the impasse on climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the joint statement said nations need to resolve the issue, they did not indicate what should be the solution at the UN summit set to end on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As host of this year's G20 meetings, Brazil expanded the group's focus on extreme poverty and hunger, while introducing debate on cooperation to fairly tax the world's wealthiest – topics also highlighted in the leaders' joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva opened the summit on Monday with the launch of a global alliance to combat poverty and hunger, with backing from more than 80 countries, along with multilateral banks and major philanthropies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping also took the occasion to announce a raft of measures designed to support the developing economies of the "Global South," from scientific cooperation with Brazil and African nations to lowering trade barriers for least developed countries. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Xi Jinping says Group of 20 leaders should act to help cool the Ukraine crisis. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779796_3_20241119101708.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

    Thai police station comes under siege - from monkeys

<img alt="Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779750_1_20241118213246.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in central Thailand said they barricaded themselves into their own station over the weekend, after a menacing mob of 200 escaped monkeys ran riot.
 <br>
  <br>
  The human inhabitants of Lopburi have long suffered from a growing and aggressive monkey population and authorities have built special enclosures to contain groups of the unruly residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday around 200 of the primates broke out and rampaged through town, with one posse descending on a local police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to make sure doors and windows are closed to prevent them from entering the building for food," police captain Somchai Seedee said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was concerned the marauders could destroy property including police documents, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic cops and officers on guard duty were called in to fend off the visitors, the Lopburi police said on Facebook on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a dozen of the intruders were still perched on the roof of the police station on Monday, photos from local media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down in the streets, police and local authorities were working to round up individuals, luring them away from residential areas with food.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Thailand is an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, it has long assimilated Hindu traditions and lore from its pre-Buddhist era.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, monkeys are afforded a special place in Thai hearts thanks to the heroic Hindu monkey god Hanuman, who helped Rama rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of an evil demon king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the primates rule the streets around the Pra Prang Sam Yod temple in the centre of Lopburi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The town has been laying on an annual feast of fruit for its population of macaques since the late 1980s, part religious tradition and part tourist attraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their growing numbers, property damage and fights have made for an uneasy coexistence with their human neighbours.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spirit Airlines said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection, after the pioneer of no-frills travel in the US struggled with a long run of quarterly losses, failed merger attempts and looming debt maturities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, had been losing money despite strong travel demand as it struggled with higher operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's troubles deepened after the collapse of its US$3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that grounded many of its aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline listed its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of US$1 billion to US$10 billion each, according to a court filing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline, as part of the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has received commitment for a US$350 million equity investment from existing bondholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Existing bondholders will also provide US$300 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which, together with available cash, is expected to support the airline through the Chapter 11 process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it expected to continue its flight operations through the proceedings and customers can book and fly without interruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the near term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it expected to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's shares, halted for trading on Monday, have plunged more than 90 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company started out as a long-haul trucking company in 1964 before shifting to aviation around 1983. It offered leisure packages to popular destinations under the name Charter One Airlines and rebranded to Spirit in 1992. (Reuters/AP)

<img alt="Alan Jones has been charged with a total of 26 offences against nine alleged victims. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779755_1_20241118221129.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been hit with two additional charges, after being arrested on Monday for a string of alleged historical sex crimes.
 <br>
  <br>
  A police spokesman said the veteran broadcaster was charged with an additional two counts of indecent assault relating to a ninth victim, bringing the total to 26 charges, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault against people that had been employed by Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 83-year-old is a household name across Australia and for years held immense sway through his top-rating radio talk show.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a colourful career, he also coached the national men's rugby team, was a speechwriter for an Australian prime minister, and taught at one of the country's most prestigious schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detectives from a dedicated child abuse squad arrested Jones on Monday while executing a search warrant at his luxury Sydney Harbour apartment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was later released on bail ahead of a court appearance in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones has strenuously denied prior allegations of indecent assault which surfaced in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper late last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will allege that the accused knew some of them personally. Some of them professionally," state crime commander Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offending, Fitzgerald said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. They are fully aware, as are the investigators, that the hard work is just beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Whether as a sports coach, aspiring politician or radio heavyweight, Jones has spent decades in the public eye.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rose to fame while coaching the Australian rugby side in the 1980s, leading the Wallabies to a rare "grand slam" over England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His feats as a coach and administrator earned him a place in Australia's sports hall of fame, where he was inducted in 1989. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Tuesday said the T1 signal will remain in force until at least 10pm.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi had continued to weaken, and was closest to the SAR, skirting within about 400 kilometres of the city. It issued the T1 on Monday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, coastal water levels would will be higher than normal between 10 pm and midnight on Tuesday, and warned of possible minor flooding in some low-lying coastal areas, and urged the public to take care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be swells," it added. "Members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy reached a second consecutive Billie Jean King Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland on Monday in Malaga.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Swiatek came from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles rubber but the Italian earned immediate revenge over the five-time Grand Slam winner in the deciding doubles clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini and veteran Sara Errani overcame Swiatek and Katarzyna Kawa 7-5, 7-5 in the doubles rubber to send the four-time champions through to Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening singles rubber, Italy's Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Magda Linette in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed by Swiatek's three-set battle with Paolini which ran over two-and-a-half hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough today – the intensity was insane, I was a little bit tired but I said to myself, you still have to play the doubles, you have to give everything for Italy, for my team," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I lost the singles match I was a little bit sad, but then tried to go in the locker room and think positive about the doubles," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linette, world number 38, was largely outclassed by Bronzetti, ranked 78th, in the first singles rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 4-1 down in the second set, Linette battled back strongly to force a tie-break but was eventually beaten when she slapped a return into the net after saving one match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  It left the pressure on Swiatek to deliver, which she did in thrilling fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten every time in their three prior clashes and having never managed to take a set off Swiatek, Paolini battled with fierce determination from the outset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek crushed the world number four in straight sets in the French Open final earlier this year but found a vastly tougher opponent in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole saved two break points to hold at 2-2 and then broke with a fizzing forehand to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not deter Paolini, who doubled down and won the next four games, securing two breaks of her own, to claim the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek spurned three break points in the final game and showed signs of tiredness after helping Poland reach the semi-finals by winning both her singles match and a doubles rubber against the Czech Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini had done the same for last year's runners-up Italy against Japan but dug deep to keep Swiatek at bay until the 10th and final game of the second set, which the Pole won to force a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the players exchanged breaks in the decider, Swiatek eventually triumphed when Paolini went long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 13 of the 16 break points she faced, proving the stronger in the key moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it was tough, my energy level was down in the second set but I managed to get back and that was the most important thing," said Swiatek, explaining she had "no time to celebrate" as the job was not done yet. (AFP)

 Bryan Zaragoza won and converted a late penalty to help Euro 2024 winners Spain beat Switzerland 3-2 in a Uefa Nations League dead rubber on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nations League holders, already guaranteed top spot in Group A4, twice took the lead but were pegged back by the already-relegated Swiss in Tenerife.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first Spain match on the island in 28 years and fans were able to celebrate a win after Bayern Munich winger Zaragoza's late spot-kick settled the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Luis de la Fuente changed his whole line-up from the win over Denmark on Friday, handing Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aitor Paredes his debut in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeremi Pino, a Canary Islander, sent Spain ahead on home territory after 32 minutes after Pedri's penalty was saved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Alvaro Morata won the penalty and handed Pedri, born in Tenerife, the ball to take the spot kick, but Yvon Mvogo saved the Barcelona midfielder's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here at home with a goal, the win – I can't ask for more," Pino said. "It was a very special game – full marks to the fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente sent on another Spain debutant at half-time in Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joel Monteiro levelled for Switzerland but a few minutes later Bryan Gil stole the ball back to restore Spain's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andi Zeqiri fired home from the spot after a foul by Fabian Ruiz in the 85th minute but Zaragoza ensured Spain could finish a spectacular year on a high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, on loan at Osasuna from Bayern, burst into the box and was brought crashing down by Vincent Sierro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaragoza clinically dispatched the resulting penalty to spark jubilant celebrations in Tenerife. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed mixed on Monday, with traders bracing for Nvidia earnings later this week, and piling into Tesla on reports that President-elect Donald Trump could ease regulation on self-driving vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent to 43,389.60, while the S&P 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,893.62.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 18,791.81, buoyed by a jump in the share price of electric vehicle maker Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's share price jumped 5.6 percent following a Bloomberg News report over the weekend that Trump is looking to ease the restrictions on self-driving cars, which could benefit Tesla -- which is run by Trump-backer Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But elsewhere, it was "a relatively unremarkable day, in terms of magnitude of move," said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management, adding that this wasn't surprising, citing the post-election market "explosion," and the subsequent drawback last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kind of entered the new week at a midpoint with very little economic data," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are also looking ahead to earnings from chip designing titan Nvidia after markets close on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Kremlin warns against use of US long-range missiles

<img alt="Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use Army Tactical Missile System to hit military installations and airfields inside Russia. File photo: AFP/John Hamilton/US Department of Defence" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779746_1_20241118205717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday accused US President Joe Biden of escalating the war in Ukraine over reports that he has allowed Kyiv to use long-range missiles supplied by Washington to strike targets inside Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments from Moscow came as Ukraine said a fresh Russian strike on the Black Sea port city of Odesa had killed at least eight people and wounded 18, following a massive weekend attack on the country's creaking energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials as ATACMS, to hit military installations – and in particular airfields – inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine says it is mainly seeking to use the weapons to prevent Russian aerial bombardments that have levelled entire districts and towns near the front line and decimated energy facilities across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US official spoke about the policy shift on condition of anonymity on Sunday, saying the decision had come in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to aid its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If such a decision was really formulated and announced to the Kyiv regime, then of course it's a qualitatively new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the US's engagement in the conflict," Peskov added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said President Vladimir Putin had expressed Russia's position clearly in September when the leader said that such a move would put Nato "at war" with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said in September that if Ukraine were to attack Russia with the long-range missiles then Moscow would "take the appropriate decisions based on the threats". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said three franchised bus operators have asked for fare hikes of between 6.5 and 9.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said KMB and New Lantao Bus are seeking hikes of 6.5 percent, while Citybus wants a 9.5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies made the applications for higher fares earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the bus operators have averaged around 3.7 million passenger trips a day in the first half of this year, about 90 to 95 percent of what they were before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the government has been helping the firms boost income and cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, with rising salary expenses and volatile fuel costs, as well as continued competition for passengers with other transport modes, the financial situation of franchised bus operators has not been satisfactory," the bureau said in the document.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will strike a balance between the public's affordability and financial sustainability of the operators when considering the applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the bus firms raised fares from between a little less than 4 percent and 7 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

    Bentancur gets seven-game ban over alleged racial slur

<img alt="Rodrigo Bentancur has since apologised to South Korean teammate Son Heung-min. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779739_1_20241118195332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur was on Monday given a seven-match domestic ban by the Football Association over an alleged racist remark made about teammate Son Heung-min in a TV interview.
 <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was charged by the FA in September in connection with an alleged breach of its rules during the interview in his home country of Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Juventus player, who has also been fined £100,000 (US$126,000), had been asked in June by a presenter for a Spurs player's shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replied: "Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur, 27, apologised to the South Korea international but because it was deemed an "aggravated breach," an independent regulatory commission panel was required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel upheld the charge and Bentancur will have to sit out Tottenham's next seven domestic fixtures, though he will be able to play in Europa League matches against Roma and Rangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA said in a statement that it was alleged that the incident constituted an "aggravated breach... as it included a reference – whether express or implied – to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rodrigo Bentancur denied this charge, but the independent regulatory commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son, speaking in late September, said: "He apologised straight afterwards when we had holiday. I was at home. I didn't even realise what was going on. He sent me a long message and you could feel it was coming from his heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said Bentancur had acknowledged his mistake and had pleaded for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur will not return to domestic action until December 26, missing Premier League matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Tottenham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Uruguayan has played 15 times for Tottenham this season, scoring one goal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden on Monday began sending some five million pamphlets to residents urging them to prepare for the possibility of war, as neighbouring Finland launched a new preparedness website.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both Sweden and Finland dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led military alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 assault on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the war, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of war, citing the serious security situation in its vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The booklet "If Crisis or War Comes", sent by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), contains information about how to prepare for emergencies such as war, natural disasters, or cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous version sent out in 2018 made headlines, as it was the first time it had been sent to Swedes since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war," MSB director Mikael Frisell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-page document outlines with simple illustrations the threats facing the Nordic nation, including military conflict, natural disasters, and cyber and terror attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes tips for preparedness, such as keeping non-perishable food in stock and storing water.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSB said the updated 2024 version had a stronger focus on preparation for war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next two weeks 5.2 million copies will be sent to Swedish households.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages – including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden's former army chief Micael Byden alarmed many of his compatriots in January when he urged them to consider their own preparedness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Swedes have to mentally prepare for war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the government in Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia, launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises. (AFP)

    Tai Lam Tunnel to charge time-varying tolls: sources

<img alt="Sources said the authorities plan to charge time-varying tolls for Tai Lam Tunnel from May next year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779732_1_20241118184742.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said on Monday that the government plans to charge cheaper, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes control of the infrastructure in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tolling system would be similar to the ones for the three cross-harbour tunnels brought in last year, with three levels of charges for peak, general and non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car drivers need to pay HK$58 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau with Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said in future, it will be HK$45 for peak, HK$30 for general and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  An across-the-board charge of HK$28 is being mooted for taxis, down from HK$58 at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  And commercial vehicles will pay HK$43, which would be cheaper than current toll levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs the Legco transport panel, said he finds HK$45 for private cars during peak hours to be on the high side.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for taxis, he said the toll could be set at HK$25, the same as that for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared with the current situation, perhaps some truck drivers using Tuen Mun Road may turn to Tai Lam Tunnel (during peak hours in future), causing further congestion," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I believe if the government charges the time-varying tolls, that can allow the spread of traffic in an orderly manner. I think that's a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel's 30-year franchise began in 1995 and is currently fully-owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties.

    Fatalities as typhoon Man-yi lashes the Philippines

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed as super typhoon Man-yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate," President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. "We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced."
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110km per hour and gustiness of up to 135kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower," Dagdagan said inside the living room of his flooded home. "It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the US. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Monday said the chances of it issuing a T3 over Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi are not high, because winds across the city are not expected to get so strong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Man-yi adopts a more northerly track or edges closer to the coast of Guangdong with a higher intensity, the chance of issuing Strong Wind Signal No 3 is relatively low," said the observatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the T1 issued in the morning will remain in place until at least 10am on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Hong Kong is expected to be spared the worst of the storm, showers are likely to become more frequent on Tuesday and some minor flooding is possible in low-lying areas over the next two days, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is expected to skirt around 400 kilometres to the south of the SAR on Tuesday morning.

    First electric ferry to begin tests in HK waters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first electric ferry will arrive in the city this week and will be put into service after tests are completed, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier earmarked HK$350 million for a pilot scheme subsidising operators to introduce a total of four electric ferries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of these, operated by Sun Ferry, will conduct its final tests in Hong Kong waters by the end of this year, before it starts running between North Point and Hung Hom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanessa Au, an assistant director of the EPD, said the use of electric ferries will improve air quality around Victoria Harbour, and they are also more cost-effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the operating expenses for ferries can be reduced, but we have to test how much the actual reduction can be," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope within 24 months we can compare the electricity consumption and the traditional fuel consumption. Because it's using the motor technology, we hope to cut the maintenance cost as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au said charging an electric ferry for about eight hours overnight is enough for a full day's operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that solar panels will be installed on the deck of the ferries to support part of the lighting system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Cheng-qi, deputy general manager of Sun Ferry, said he hopes to see more electric ferries in Hong Kong, but the industry needs further assistance from the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Charging facilities may be an obstacle. If supporting facilities can be refined, ferry services can have a better prospect in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said charging facilities have already been installed at North Point, Hung Hom and Kwun Tong ferry piers.

    Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment

<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said a year-round recruitment drive is proving effective in tackling a manpower crunch across various departments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has been continuously recruiting for some roles since October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower.

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A non-governmental organisation says having a hearing impairment should not be an impediment to seeking mental health support.
 <br>
  <br>
  That is why Silence Limited, one of 11 Operation Santa Claus beneficiaries this year, has launched a project titled "Finding a Way to My Heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGO's Operations Director, Ken Ng, said Silence Limited would provide sign language interpretation services via the project for people with hearing loss during their consultations at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental health issues [are] not easy to diagnose by equipment or machines. Basically, the psychiatrist or the doctors have to talk or communicate with the patients to find out what the real issue is," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many of our clients report that it is not easy to get an in-house sign language interpreter to attend the consultation," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Established in 2008, Silence Limited aims to bring people with hearing impairments together, promote social inclusion, and foster equal development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our projects mainly focus on trying to fill up the gaps of existing services, how to improve the mental health situation of our clients. So we will provide or acquire sign language interpreters to participate in the medical consultation sections as well as the workshops or even the activities of our programme," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Biden makes historic visit to Amazon rainforest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping says he is looking forward to having an in-depth exchange of views with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on further enhancing China-Brazil relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks in a written statement upon his arrival in Rio de Janeiro for the 19th G20 Summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president arrived from Lima, where he had attended the Apec Leaders' meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  People from different walks of life lined the streets of Rio de Janeiro to welcome Xi, who arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday afternoon, local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welcoming crowds were seen waving Chinese and Brazilian national flags and holding banners adorned with messages offering a warm welcome, as the Chinese leader's motorcade passed by.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement, President Xi noted that China and Brazil were marking 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties and it was important to build on past achievements while forging ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He extended sincere greetings and best wishes to the government and people of Brazil, describing the two nations as like-minded friends with the same aspirations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said he felt very close to Brazil, having visited four times over the past 30 years and having witnessed development and changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said China and Brazil, as part of the voice of the Global South in the international arena, had made important contributions in promoting world peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he looked forward to attending the 19th G20 Leaders' Summit and was ready to work with all parties to jointly advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19th G20 Summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on Monday and Tuesday, under the theme of "building a just world and a sustainable planet". (Xinhua)

 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)
