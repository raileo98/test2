<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has told delegates to the national legislative body to ride on the stock market boom and boost economic development in the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also expressed confidence that the city can "weather the storm" in face of challenges posed by geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments on Tuesday during a closed-door exchange with National People's Congress (NPC) delegates from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Starry Lee, said the central government highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong administration on supporting the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the city's economy has been relatively stable, and able to achieve a 2.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that Hong Kong’s economy is relatively stable … especially the stock market, the volume [went up]. All these [were contributed by] the support of the central government," she told reporters after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming future, we will continue as NPC (members) to act as (contributors) to the economic development, and to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong people."
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok said the director singled out the city's stock market as an area of focus.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He said] if we can continue in this aspect, [it'll] certainly be helpful to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if geopolitics had been part of the conversation, the delegates quoted Xia as saying that some of the pressure faced by the country would "inevitably pass down to Hong Kong", but such challenges could be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the office said Xia expressed the hope for the delegates to perform their duties "with a sense of responsibility and mission" and reflect public opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement went on to say the director told the members to fully support their respective SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia urged Hong Kong delegates to expedite the city's transition from stability to prosperity, and those from Macau to promote moderate economic diversification, the statement added.

    EU chief unveils $US840 billion 'rearm' plan

<img alt="EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has called for the Europe to 'rearm'. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794224_1_20250304205503.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some $US844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to $US844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a $US158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide $US157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)

<img alt="Woo Chia-wai was credited for setting up the world-class HKUST Business School during his tenure. Photo courtesy: HKUST" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794219_1_20250304203731.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founding president of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has died last Sunday at the age of 87.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Woo Chia-wei led the university during 1991 and 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Tuesday, HKUST council chairman Harry Shum said Woo's departure marked an irreplaceable loss to the university, Hong Kong and the global academic community.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professor Woo was one of the few individuals with both grand visions and strong capability of execution. With unwavering dedication, he led the establishment of HKUST, transforming a bold vision into a world-class institution renowned for its pioneering research, innovation, and global impact, especially during a time when Hong Kong was in a critical juncture of transitioning to a knowledge-based economy,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current HKUST president, Nancy Yip, who worked alongside Woo for eight years when he was in charge, was also saddened by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man of extraordinary foresight, Professor Woo envisioned and empowered HKUST as a catalyst for Hong Kong's transformation. He forged a culture of excellence, recruiting distinguished faculty, designing cutting-edge curricula, and fostering partnerships with leading global institutions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo’s son, Wu Dekai, expressed gratitude to the love and support his family has received during a difficult time. Also a professor at HKUST's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, he strived to carry forward his father's innovation, determination and can-do spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than his role in the university, the elder Woo also held positions in several government committees, and was appointed a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physicist had also earned the Gold Bauhinia Star and Commander of the British Empire.

 The chairman of a leading casino and hospitality group in Macau said on Tuesday that his city and Hong Kong should work together to attract more foreign investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing, Galaxy Entertainment Group chairman Francis Lui said Macau’s leisure industry has been developing steadily in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he has full confidence in the industry’s future development, adding that the two SARs can work together to take business to a new level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong and Macau, we have a common objective in making sure that there will be more foreign players, customers and investors coming over,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we should cooperate with each other, making sure that all the hardware, all the services and all the resources behind Hong Kong and Macau could be working together to make sure that we bring in foreign investors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said Hong Kong’s economic development is an issue for delegates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes the central government will introduce measures during the Two Sessions that will help revitalise the city’s economy.

    China to firmly defend its interests: ambassador

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States says while China needs to firmly defend its interests, it will continue to handle Sino-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xie Feng’s comments came after US President Donald Trump's order to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports, from 10 to 20 percent, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against the tariffs by announcing additional levies of up to 15 percent on various US agricultural products, including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from March 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie said those who start conflicts by harming others will ultimately hurt themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the one side, we must acknowledge the significant challenges facing China-US relations. On the flip side, we should maintain our confidence in China's progress and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, staying determined. Whether it’s a tariff war or trade war, such disputes often begin by harming others but end up hurting oneself," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie is currently in Beijing for the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) outlined efforts to advance Chinese modernisation and refine standards and procedures at the start of the top political advisory body's annual session in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The firm which operates the Octopus Card on Tuesday said it hopes to shorten the process needed to implement the government's plans to scale back the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the budget last week, the government proposed limiting the HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elderly passengers would also have to pay 20 percent of future trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said last week it would take around 18 months to adjust each and every Octopus machine to adopt the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a media gathering, Octopus chairwoman Jeny Yeung said it would take time to implement the scheme because different transport operators have different discounts and fare calculation methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it should take the company at least a year to discuss these issues with them to adjust the system, as well as conduct trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said Octopus would seek to finish the work in less than 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the firm wants to introduce a new function in the second half of the year that would allow users who installed the Octopus mobile app to send money to another app user, or an actual card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such payments would require entering the card details of the other user.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added the firm is trying to extend its services to Japan in the third quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the idea is that transactions would go through the Octopus mobile app, as the firm is discussing cooperation plans with platforms that have wider coverage in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past year or so, the firm extended services to mainland China and Thailand.

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

 Entrepreneurs and leaders of mainland private enterprises have expressed hope that Beijing will roll out more supportive measures to assist with the nation's industrial upgrade, while balancing the development of various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the annual "two sessions", or "lianghui", kicked off on Tuesday, with thousands of political elites and lawmakers arriving in the capital to set policy agenda for the country's strategic areas including in economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, He Xiaopeng, chief executive officer of Chinese EV company XPeng, noted that while China has always been supportive of its private sector, more measures were being offered to firms that fall into the so-called "entity industries", which include agriculture, industrial production, telecommunications, and infrastructure construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, who is an NPC deputy, also hoped to bring XPeng's latest flying vehicles technology to Hong Kong to grasp opportunities offered by the SAR's so-called "low-altitude economy".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to let more people see the latest dynamics in the low-altitude flying technology," he told RTHK, adding that XPeng wuold also apply for trials covering flying vehicles and that there was vast potential in the industry, especially in the coastal regions.

    China's economy solid amid challenges: NPC spokesman

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s economy has a solid foundation with new growth drivers despite facing some challenges in the coming year, a spokesman for the top legislature said on Tuesday, as dates for the parliament’s annual session were announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) will kick off on Wednesday and run until March 11, lasting for seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the session, Beijing is expected to announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Undoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought the external environment have deepened and China’s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,” Lou Qinjian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But it’s more important to note that China’s economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience and vast potential.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States doubling additional tariffs on Chinese imports, the spokesman said trade disputes should be settled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  “By imposing unilateral tariffs, the US has violated WTO rules and disrupted the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains,” Lou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the US can work in the same direction as China and find a solution through equal-footed consultation. China is also ready to work more closely with other countries to safeguard the hard-earned multilateral trading system, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and advance a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said the progress of DeepSeek reflects the rise of Chinese companies in artificial intelligence, saying such firms have become the backbone of the country’s science and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lou said while artificial intelligence technologies are accompanied by “unknown risks”, China attaches great importance to their development.

 The president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on Tuesday said she hopes the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) will fully consider its plan to set up the SAR's third medical school.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Shuyang, a member of the National People's Congress, told RTHK that the hospital has worked with the institution on technology and technological research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both parties also cooperate on medical projects, medical education and training for doctors, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zhang said she was unaware of HKUST's plan to start a medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she hopes the university will conduct research on its proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKUST's president Nancy Ip revealed earlier that research and technology would be a focus of the medical school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, and also a delegate to the National People's Congress, on Tuesday said the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme to Qingdao provided great convenience for exchanges between Qingdao and the two SARs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was expanded in March last year to cover a number of mainland cities, including Qingdao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeng Zanrong told RTHK ahead of the preparatory meeting of the National People's Congress the implementation of the scheme had gone very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted there were many exchanges between Qingdao and the SARs on various aspects, including technological innovation, finance, and shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foshan mayor Bai Tao said he will work to get his city covered by the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bai, who's also a NPC delegate, said he welcomes Hong Kong residents to travel to Foshan, adding that there are no barriers to doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes visits can foster the relationship between people in the two cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor also said he welcomes SAR enterprises to expand their businesses in Foshan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing a range of between 10 and 15 percent hikes to import levies covering a basket of American agricultural and food products, while placing 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "An additional 15 percent tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton," the Finance Ministry said, adding "additional 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's unilateral tariffs measures seriously violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US," the Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, launching new trade conflicts with the top three US trading partners. (Reuters)

    HK govt still in the dark over new US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Secretary Algernon Yau on Tuesday said the SAR government still doesn't know whether new US tariffs on Chinese goods will also cover Hong Kong products, but in any case transit trade could be hit in the short term.
 <br>
  <br>
  An additional 10 percent duty on Chinese exports to the US is expected to come into force on Tuesday, following the extra 10 percent imposed by US President Donald Trump last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington earlier clarified that the first tariffs move did apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a RTHK radio programme, Yau reiterated the government's opposition to Trump's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, Hong Kong is a separate customs territory and the executive order is said to add duties on Chinese goods. But previous documents from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Customs and Border Protection have included Hong Kong goods as well. We have already announced that we'll file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time the US added another 10 percent levy on Chinese products. But it's very unclear; they did not say whether Hong Kong was included in the new tariffs. So we are studying whether they included Hong Kong this time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said transit trade could be affected, but the tariffs won't have a significant impact as Hong Kong's exports to the US account for less than 0.1 percent of the city's overall exports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the commerce chief said there have been significant improvements in the city's trade of liquor, after tax on some spirits was reduced last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 was cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said trading volumes of liquor increased by 60 percent from October to the end of January, while the value of the liquor traded rose by 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The momentum has been quite good in recent months. The reason we reduced the duties on premium liquor was that we wanted to develop Hong Kong into a trading centre for premium liquor. This would then have a knock-on effect to the catering, hospitality, logistics, and warehouse sectors, it could bring significant economic impacts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope to help Chinese baijiu to go global using the SAR as a trading centre. So we hope to boost trades on liquor, but not that we are encouraging people to consume more alcohol," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister encouraged SAR businesses to tap into opportunities brought by the rising e-commerce trend globally, noting that the sector accounts for some 20 percent of global trade, with revenues in this market rising by double digits on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second edition of the "Hong Kong Shopping Festival" will be held in the SAR in August to further capture the booming e-commerce business, Yau said, adding that authorities also hope to take the festival to Asean member states to promote Hong Kong products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine following his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official said, deepening the fissure that has opened between the two one-time allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Trump upended US policy on Ukraine and Russia upon taking office in January, adopting a more conciliatory stance towards Moscow - and after an explosive confrontation with Zelensky at the White House on Friday in which Trump criticiSed him for being insufficiently grateful for Washington's support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution," said a White House official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House had no immediate comment on the scope and amount of aid affected or how long the pause would last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pentagon could not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment nor did the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again said Zelensky should be more appreciative of American support after earlier responding angrily to an Associated Press report quoting Zelensky as saying the end of the war is "very, very far away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. (Reuters)

    Facial recognition mulled after alleged Kai Tak breach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Facial recognition technology could be deployed at Kai Tak Sports Park and other venues to stop people sneaking in without permission, Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her comment follows a report by Wen Wei Po on Monday that two reporters managed to attend the park's opening ceremony last weekend despite not having tickets. The newspaper said the pair, and a man that helped them get inside, also managed to avoid security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said police are investigating the alleged breach, but such a lapse wouldn't demonstrate any "large-scale loophole" in security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there might be a need to use technology to stop people such as backstage staff from getting non-ticket holders into venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The authorities need to check whether the person entering a place is the actual pass-holder. Say if you own the pass but you gave it to me, I shouldn't be allowed in," the minister said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether we can adopt real-name registration here, or, as some people suggested, use facial recognition, we can discuss these things with event organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said officials are hoping to bring non-local football teams to play at the sports park in the summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the staging of the National Games in Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November will provide a litmus test regarding the possibility of the region holding other major tournaments in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we host the Games well, that would prove that the Greater Bay Area city cluster is very much capable of hosting major sporting tournaments. Would this be the Olympics, or, I've also heard others say, perhaps the Asian Games?", she said

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the capital have stepped up security ahead of the annual “Two Sessions” meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates are in Beijing for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) starting on Tuesday and the National People's Congress (NPC) a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are more patrolling officers and security guards. Public security officers are also doing ID checks,” a Beijing resident told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the Netherlands said this is his first visit to Beijing, and he felt safe thanks to the presence of more officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the metro, there are guards at the entrance, so when you go inside they check [and] see if you bring no trouble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to go to the scanner, put your bags in the scanner and they just see if you have nothing with you that you can't bring.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC deputy, Johnny Ng, believes the arrangements this year will be more flexible, allowing them to communicate better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can flexibly have more communication with other delegates in CPPCC because we have over 2,000 [to] 3,000 people together,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that we can have more communications this year, in order to make sure Hong Kong can have more cooperation with other delegates and cities.”

    SpaceX calls off Starship test flight at last minute

<img alt="The latest test flight was to include another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794109_1_20250304101337.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX called off the latest test flight of its Starship rocket just before its scheduled launch on Monday, citing an unspecified problem with the behemoth spacecraft.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Standing down from today's flight test attempt," SpaceX posted on X, also owned by Musk. "Starship team is determining the next best available opportunity to fly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest and most powerful rocket was set to take off with no crew at 6:45pm local time from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rescheduled launch has yet to be announced, though SpaceX employee Dan Huot said it was expected "to be about 24 hours" during a live feed of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight will be Starship's eighth orbital mission overall and first since a dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is designed to eventually be fully reusable and plays a crucial role in Musk and SpaceX's vision of colonising Mars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Nasa is awaiting a modified version of the rocket for its Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded Starship after its previous flight on January 16 ended with the upper stage disintegrating in a fiery cascade over the Turks and Caicos Islands, prompting clean-up efforts for fallen debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the upcoming flight, SpaceX says it has introduced numerous upgrades to the upper-stage spacecraft, enhancing its reliability and performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission, expected to last just over an hour, includes another attempt to catch the booster stage using the launch tower's "chopstick" arms – a feat SpaceX has successfully executed twice, including in the last flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the first commercial mission of Europe's new heavy-lift rocket Ariane 6 was called off minutes before it was scheduled to launch, due to an "anomaly" on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest of several postponements for the rocket as Europe seeks to secure independent access to space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new round of negotiations for an international treaty on reducing global plastics pollution will be held in Geneva in August, the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A previous round of negotiations – tasked with hammering out a legally binding treaty – ended without agreement in South Korea last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plastic pollution is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trenches, and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on the Unep website of the new talks comes in the wake of a last-ditch Cop16 finance deal on biodiversity agreed in Rome last week by delegates from some 150 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unep said the new plastics talks will be held at the Palais des Nations in Geneva from August 5 to 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's South Korea talks broke down following opposition from a bloc of mainly oil-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from nearly 200 nations debated for a week on how to stop millions of tonnes of plastic waste from entering the environment each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were meant to end with the world's first accord on cutting plastics pollution after nearly two years of discussions, but concluded without an agreement – except to extend talks. (AFP)

    China warns of countermeasures against new US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to retaliate against fresh US import tariffs set to take effect later in the day, reiterating its stance that the Trump administration was trying to "shift the blame" and "bully" Beijing over fentanyl flows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra 10 percent duty that US President Donald Trump threatened China with last week is expected to enter into force at 0501 GMT on March 4, resulting in a cumulative 20 percent tariff in response to what the White House considers Chinese inaction over drug flows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariff represents an additional hike to pre-existing levies on thousands of Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Times reported on Monday that China had American agricultural and food products in its crosshairs, and would hit back with a series of both tariffs and non-tariff measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has repeatedly stated that the US' unilateral tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and undermine the multilateral trade system, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such measures will not solve [the US'] problems but instead will harm China-US economic and trade cooperation and disrupt regular international trade," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China urges the US to "immediately withdraw" its unilateral tariff measures that are "unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others," the ministry added. (Reuters)

 Stock markets in Hong Kong and on the mainland both opened lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the upcoming annual parliamentary sessions to gauge Beijing's policy path.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 328.02 points, or 1.43 per cent, to open at 22,678 points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Tech Index was down over three per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index dropped 0.6 per cent at the open, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market focus is shifting from the recent tech and AI themes to the National People's Congress meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing was expected to maintain its economic growth target at roughly five per cent and announce a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell more than one per cent in early trade, dragged by overnight Wall Street declines and a stronger yen, with US tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect as planned later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump also reaffirmed that he will increase tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent from the previous 10 per cent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump's announcement, Beijing warned on Tuesday that it would take countermeasures against new US tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated against the US dollar as the greenback slid, knocking down exporters shares and further dragging investor sentiment. (Agencies)

    Study paints grim picture of obesity

<img alt="Researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794096_1_20250304090417.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 60 per cent of all adults and a third of all children in the world will be overweight or obese by 2050 unless governments take action, a large new study said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The research published in the Lancet medical journal used data from 204 countries to paint a grim picture of what it described as one of the great health challenges of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," lead author Emmanuela Gakidou, from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of overweight or obese people worldwide rose from 929 million in 1990 to 2.6 billion in 2021, the study found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a serious change, the researchers estimate that 3.8 billion adults will be overweight or obese in 15 years - or around 60 per cent of the global adult population in 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's health systems will come under crippling pressure, the researchers warned, with around a quarter of the world's obese expected to be aged over 65 by that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also predicted a 121-per cent increase in obesity among children and adolescents around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third of all obese young people will be living in two regions - North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean - by 2050, the researchers warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is not too late to act, said study co-author Jessica Kerr from Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much stronger political commitment is needed to transform diets within sustainable global food systems," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That commitment was also needed for strategies "that improve people's nutrition, physical activity and living environments, whether it's too much processed food or not enough parks," Kerr said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than half the world's overweight or obese adults already live in just eight countries - China, India, the United States, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and Egypt, the study said.

 US stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, after US President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions against China and levies on Mexico and Canada neared imposition, while European defence shares soared as the European Union sought increased military spending over Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had signed an executive order raising tariffs on China to 20 per cent, shortly after Trump seemed to rule out any change to the planned 25 per cent tariffs against Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent, while the broad-based S&P lost 1.8 per cent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq took a harsher tumble, closing down 2.6 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX - colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" - surged, hitting its highest level since December.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, BAE Systems surged 14 per cent, helping London's benchmark FTSE 100 index to a record high, the latest in a series over recent months.
  <br>

  French defence group Thales won more than 16 per cent and German peer Rheinmetall rallied 15 per cent. (AFP)

    Tariffs to go ahead on Mexican and Canadian imports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that 25 percent taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada would start on Tuesday, sparking renewed fears of a North American trade war that already showed signs of pushing up inflation and hindering growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Tomorrow - tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. And that’ll start,” Trump told reporters in the Roosevelt Room. “They’re going to have to have a tariff.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has said the tariffs are to force the two US neighbours to step up their fight against fentanyl trafficking and stop illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has also indicated that he wants to eliminate the Americas' trade imbalances as well and push more factories to relocate in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments quickly rattled the US stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the Trump administration remains confident that tariffs are the best choice to boost US manufacturing and attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump provided a one-month delay in February as both Mexico and Canada promised concessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said that there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to avoid the steep new tariffs, which were also set to tax Canadian energy products, such as oil and electricity, at a lower 10 per cent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If Trump is imposing tariffs, we are ready," said Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joly said Canada had a very strong border plan and explained that to Trump administration officials last week. She said diplomatic efforts were continuing. She spoke after Trump made his comments on Tuesday. (AP)

    'No major policy shifts at Two Sessions expected'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793998_1_20250303165106.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest needed penalties to beat Ipswich and book a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor was the only man who failed to score from the spot as Matz Sels' save edged the shootout 5-4 in Forest's favour to set up a last eight trip to Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sides are separated by 15 places and 31 points in the Premier League, but with Forest's priority securing Champions League football next season, Nuno Espírito Santo rested a number of his key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich sensed their opportunity and took the lead early in the second half when George Hirst headed in a corner at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Yates took advantage of some woeful defending to nod in an equaliser 22 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 30 minutes of extra-time came and went without a winner despite Nuno sending on top scorer Chris Wood and England international Morgan Gibbs-White.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sels, another of Forest's star performers this season, proved the hero after the first nine penalties of the shootout found the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In penalties one of the goalkeepers is going to be the hero," said Sels. "I'm happy I could help the team to the next round. It was the only penalty I was in the right corner." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A car driven into a crowd in the German city of Mannheim on Monday killed one person and injured several, police said, adding that one person had been arrested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We can now confirm that a car was driven into a pedestrian zone and that one person was killed," said police spokesman Stefan Wilhelm, adding that several people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that one suspect was arrested," he said, adding that "the investigation is continuing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilhelm said residents had been urged "to avoid the inner city area" after the emergency sparked a large-scale police operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police with heavy weapons cordoned off the area and police helicopters were seen in the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reporter for news channel NTV reported that "at least one person is lying covered under a tarpaulin".
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany has in recent months suffered a spate of violent attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month a man drove a car into a trade union demonstration in the southern city of Munich, killing a two-year-old girl and her mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December a car-ramming attack targeted a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg, killing six people and wounding hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mannheim itself was the scene of a stabbing attack at an anti-Islam rally last May in which a policeman was killed and five others were wounded. (AFP)

    Sunbeam puts on a show for one last time

<img alt="Lana Wong, left, says she has many fond memories of Sunbeam. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794043_2_20250303213509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunbeam Theatre – the North Point venue best known for its Cantonese opera performances – put on its last show on Monday night, bidding farewell to fans and opera lovers after more than half a century.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of people were already there ahead of the final show at 7.30pm, in what would be another full house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Au Yeung brought along his son, 4, for a final look at the theatre that opened back in 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's a great memory for many people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never watched any Chinese opera before. But I think it is very valuable for most of the Hong Kong people, especially for the (older) generations. I hope the traditional Chinese opera can be extended to the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew To, a Malaysian who has been living in the SAR for over 20 years, was at Sunbeam Theatre for the second night in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I'm not taking photo, but I'm just here to walk around, to see the people around, what they are doing, how they're saying farewells... Just soaking in the moment before it's gone forever," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran actress Lana Wong, 94, performed at Sunbeam many times in the past. On this night, she came to watch the final show and say farewell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sunbeam is like my family, it's like my family being torn apart today. I am very, very sad," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said she doesn't believe the closure would affect the development of Cantonese opera, adding performances can still be staged in many other venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Chan also came for Sunbeam's last show, about the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping played by award-winning opera performer Loong Koon-tin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike Wong, she believes the end of the North Point landmark could have a negative impact on Cantonese opera because a lot of performances started off at Sunbeam.

  Chan, who lives in Tseung Kwan O, also said while fans can still enjoy performances at locations such as the Xiqu Centre in West Kowloon, Sunbeam is more convenient because it's closer to her and can be easily reached by the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  A church will take over the location after Sunbeam ceases operation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's police said the perpetrator of a stabbing attack in the northern city of Haifa on Monday was a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who recently returned from abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Druze are an ethno-religious minority among the Arab citizens of Israel, who's roots in the region go back centuries. They make up roughly 5.5 percent of Lebanon's population, 3 percent of Syria and 1.6 percent of Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came one day after Israel blocked aid to the Gaza Strip during an impasse over extending the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, a prominent Druze leader in Lebanon said on Sunday that he will soon visit Syria to meet its interim leader as tensions simmer between members of the minority group, the war-torn country’s interim government, and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The free Syrians must be cautious of the plots of Israel,” veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a news conference Sunday, accusing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of creating sectarian division and chaos in the country. “In Syria there is a plot for sabotage. There is a plot for sabotage in the region and for the Arabs’ national security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-week first phase of the truce ended at the weekend. It had enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance to Gaza. The Israeli decision prompted the United Nations to call on Israel for an immediate restoration of the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany also urged Israel to resume aid flow "immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel's army said it struck on Monday a "suspicious motorised vessel" off the coast of south Gaza's Khan Yunis. (Agencies)

<img alt="WWF-Hong Kong says it hopes to discuss its findings with government officials. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794010_1_20250303173647.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation groups are warning that around a quarter of almost 900 different species assessed in Hong Kong are at risk of local extinction, with types of birds and freshwater fish among the most in danger of disappearing from the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The findings were released on Monday in the 'The state of Hong Kong biodiversity' report by WWF-Hong Kong, in association with the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Outdoor Wildlife Learning Hong Kong and local researchers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assessments covered mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, butterflies, dragonflies and freshwater crustaceans. Of the 886 species researchers checked, 232 were deemed to be on the brink of local extinction while 21 were confirmed to be extinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Examples of species under threat include the Oriental magpie which is at high risk of disappearing locally, and the crested bunting which has lost its breeding population here. The Chinese floating frog, meanwhile, is already gone from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With nearly half of the native freshwater fish species at risk of local extinction, threats such as channelisation and water pollution, and the invasion of non-native species must be tackled," said Dr Alphonse Tsang, Research Assistant Professor at Lingnan University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report is accompanied by the 'Hong Kong Terrestrial Biodiversity Hotspot Map 2025' which highlights what are described as 27 critical biodiversity sites outside the protected-area system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 80 percent of the hotspots are said to have suffered from eco-vandalism, while almost half are threatened by development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report includes more than two dozen recommendations for the authorities, including the establishment of special task forces to combat poaching and a review of plans to build on ecologically important habits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to share this report to all the relevant government bureaus and departments, and we would request to have a kind of sit-down and share our thoughts with the relevant departments," said Dr Bosco Chan, director of conservation at WWF-Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxis that offer a variety of ways to pay and come equipped with systems to keep an eye on the driver  are about to arrive on the city's streets, with officials saying the only way is up when it comes to service quality.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five new taxi fleets with more than 3,500 vehicles between them were unveiled on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of the taxis are brand new and as well as accepting various forms of electronic payments rather than just cash, the fleets' various boasts include a number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles, some electric vehicles, online booking, and driver monitoring systems "for passenger convenience and driving safety", according to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan said that after years of challenges, the taxi trade can only make improvements when it comes to service and she hopes the fleets will play a leading role in this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think today is a start," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that we can promote and attract more taxis to join such a kind of fleet management so as to provide more modern and more user-friendly services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Big Boss Taxi Company, CMG Fleet Management, Sino Development (International) Company, SynCab Service and Tai Wo Management are the operators granted licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between them they will run around 20 percent of all the city's taxis, with the first fleet expected to start operating by the end of this month and all of them arriving by July.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual session of China's top political advisory body will run from Tuesday to March 10, authorities announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee will begin on Tuesday 3pm at the Great Hall of the People, and about 3,000 Chinese and international journalists have signed up to cover the annual meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the week-long session will review the work of the national committee in the past year and plan for its work this year, while also discussing government work reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media briefing, the session's spokesman, Liu Jieyi, said 2024 was a critical year for realising goals and tasks set forth in the 14th Five-Year Plan, and this year would be a concluding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The CPPCC National Committee will carry forward our fine traditions, keep in mind our political responsibilities, give full play to the CPPCC's role as a specialised consultative body, serve the overall picture by focusing on the central tasks,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will strengthen theoretical and political guidance, actively produce policy advice, and contribute our ideas and strengths to building a great modern socialist country in all respects, and rejuvenating our nation through Chinese modernisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added that China’s economy maintained steady progress in the past year, and the country also made solid advances in high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As long as we face the challenges, be confident, and follow plans of the Central Committee of the Party, the high-quality development will be able to reach new heights,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic issues are always a priority in the work of the CPPCC National Committee. Over the past year, the National Committee offered advice on a series of important economic issues, and made solid and effective contributions to economic recovery and growth.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu said about 230 CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macau played active roles in the country’s economic and social development, and the CPPCC would continue to help the two SARs integrate into the overall development of the country.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said while Hong Kong's capital account, which is used to finance large infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis, was facing higher deficits, the city's operating account was still largely balanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On the operating account, our aim is to return it to balance as soon as possible, and start to register surplus. The coming [financial] year, in 2025-2026, we will be largely in balance. The deficit is only about HK$4 billion. When you take it into the context of the government expenditure of over HK$600 billion a year, I would call that largely balanced. And then the year after, 2026-2027, we [will] start to have an operating surplus," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the city must expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis so as to drive the SAR's technological growth, but that would also mean the government's capital account would be under an imbalanced fiscal situation in the short term due to the gap between revenue and expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to match the cash flow requirements. We can consider issuing some bonds with longer tenor. That is possible. But at the same time, I have to wait and balance between cost of borrowing and the tenor," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been concerns over the city's rising debt, given authorities' plan to issue up to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the coming five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan stressed the city's debt levels remain low and it should make good use of its borrowing capacity to meet the capital account cash flow gap.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Monday said it received 2,058 reports of corruption last year, up three percent from 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft body said 480 of the complaints involved government departments, with the police getting the most at 108, followed by the Correctional Services Department with 44 and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department with 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 1,438 reports involving the private sector, more than a third concerned building management firms, with the construction industry and finance and insurance companies also seeing scores of complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 140 reports involving public bodies, including 25 linked to the Hospital Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said it prosecuted 207 people in 2024, including 16 civil servants, and 119 people were convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overall corruption situation in Hong Kong still remains very positive. We have not seen any sign of deterioration in terms of rise of corruption in Hong Kong,” said Bernard Chan, chairman of the ICAC's operations review committee.

 "Anora", the story of a sex worker who gets a chance at a new life when she marries a wealthy client on a whim, won five Academy Awards on Sunday, including the coveted best picture Oscar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The movie's 25-year-old star, Mikey Madison, was named best actress. The film also won best director for Sean Baker and trophies for original screenplay and editing.

   “Anora” creator Sean Baker won best director, best picture and two other Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday, bookending a dominant awards season for the American filmmaker whose stories seek to humanise sex workers and immigrants.
   <br>
   <br>
   Baker, 53, wrote, produced, directed and edited the film, and he swept in all four categories.
   <br>
   <br>
   With his four Oscars, Baker ties Walt Disney for the most wins in a single year in Academy Awards history.

    China factory activity grows at fastest pace in months

<img alt="The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793951_1_20250303101834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery," said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory production accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew five percent last year, reaching the official target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10 percent duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang emphasised the importance of timely policy support, saying "March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Beijing on Tuesday to attend the annual opening meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The NPC meeting will open in the capital on Wednesday, while the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong on Thursday, and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will be the acting CE during his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Executive Council will not hold meetings these two weeks as local NPC and CPPCC members will need to attend the meetings in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport on Monday, a number of local NPC deputies expressed hope for policies supporting private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that in the government work report, there will also be supporting measures to encourage more private enterprises from Hong Kong and around the world to invest in our country," said Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Iris Wong said she was upbeat about the country's potential in tech and cultural industries despite Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone can see that whether it's DeepSeek or the development of robotics, and even the recently popular Ne Zha movie, these are all achievements of our innovation, culture and technology," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member and Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said he would continue to push for more Greater Bay Area residents to visit Hong Kong, including expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to eight more cities in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate and lawmaker Johnny Ng, meanwhile, said he would propose mechanisms for fraud prevention education during the meetings in the capital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's largest bubble tea and drinks chain Mixue Group jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday after the firm raised HK$444 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
 <br>
  <br>
  Mixue sold 17 million shares in the deal at a fixed price of HK$202.50 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shares started trading at HK$262 each and the gains outpaced a 0.8 percent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail investors subscribed for 5,258 times more shares than were on offer in that tranche, according to Mixue's filings, making it one of Hong Kong's most popular ever IPOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail subscription rate was just below Bloks Group whose retail book was 6,000 times oversubscribed, a record, in its January IPO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institutional tranche of the deal was 35 times covered, the filings showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixue is often seen as China's largest chain of iced drinks, milk tea and ice cream. However, it operates more like a raw-material supplier than a traditional beverage brand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1997 as a small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Mixue has grown into a franchise giant with over 45,000 stores globally by September 2024, surpassing Starbucks' 40,576 stores worldwide. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday blocked aid flowing into Gaza, where a six-week truce enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance, prompting the UN to call for an immediate restoration of humanitarian assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli decision came as talks on a truce extension appeared to hit an impasse, after the ceasefire's 42-day first phase drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Truce mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Israel had announced a truce extension until mid-April that it said United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favouring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With uncertainty looming over the truce, both Israel and Palestinian sources reported Israeli military strikes in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported at least four people killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the fighting, said the "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people", comments echoed by Qatar which said it "strongly condemns" Israel's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which has rejected any talk of normalising ties with Israel without a Palestinian state, condemned the aid block as "a tool of blackmail and collective punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan said Israel's action "threatens to reignite" fighting in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres called for "humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union condemned what it called Hamas's refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block "risked humanitarian consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels called for "a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire". (AFP)

 The Cleveland Cavaliers erased an 18-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 133-129 in an NBA overtime thriller, boosting their league-best record with a 10th straight victory as Boston beat Denver in a clash of the past two champions.
 <br>
  <br>
  De'Andre Hunter, getting a starting nod as Cavs star Donovan Mitchell rested, scored 18 of his game-high 32 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as Cleveland poured it on late to grab their 50th win of the season against 10 defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made open shots, tried to get to the rim and get fouled," Hunter said of his late-game heroics, which saw him give Cleveland the lead for good with a three-pointer that put them up 131-129 with 30.8 seconds remaining in overtime
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter, acquired from Atlanta at the trade deadline, then came up with a steal and grabbed a rebound when Portland's Deni Avdija missed a three-pointer. Finally Hunter drilled a pair of free-throws to seal the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ty Jerome scored 25 points off the bench for Cleveland as six Cavs players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avdija led Portland with 30 points and added 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his first career triple-double. Anfernee Simons scored 27 points for the Blazers, who led most of the first half in pursuit of a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cleveland edged ahead 42-39 on Darius Garland's jump shot, Portland closed the first half on a 15-0 scoring run that sent them into the locker room leading 54-42.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs pulled level at 101-101 with just under five minutes left in the fourth quarter, and they traded the lead three more times before Simons made a pair of free-throws that tied it at 119-119 to send it to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're a resilient group," said Jerome, admitting the Cavs' come-from-behind win over the Celtics in Boston on Friday had taken it out of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's a good team," he added of the Blazers. "We just had to stay with it and make some shots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Boston, the Celtics let a big lead get away before holding off the Nuggets 110-103.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown scored 22 points and handed out eight assists to leading the reigning champion Celtics, who led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter only for Denver to pull within three points in the waning minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray scored 13 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to key the comeback, his driving layup off a rebound of a Brown miss pulling the Nuggets within 102-99 with 1:15 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBA Most valuable Player Nikola Jokic scored 20 points with 14 rebounds and nine assists for the 2023 champion Nuggets, but the Celtics came up with the shots when they needed them to snap a two-game skid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Al Horford finished with 19 points, Derrick White added 17 and Jayson Tatum had a relatively modest 16 with 11 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively, I thought we were good tonight," Brown said. "Offensively we missed some good looks.I missed some layups, I missed some open shots, but we were able to hang on." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian share markets dithered on Monday as the threat of imminent tariffs lurked in the background, while bitcoin surged on news it would be included in a new US strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump on social media announced five digital assets he expected to include in a new reserve, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, shot up more than 11 percent to US$94,110, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed 14 percent to US$2,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, helped by a softer yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.1 percent, having staged a late rally on Friday after a week of heavy losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25 percent level.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 10 percent levy on Chinese imports is also due to come into effect this week, just as the National People's Congress opens its annual session on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<img alt="Leaders gather at Lancaster House in London to discuss European security and Ukraine. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793931_1_20250303083142.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders closed ranks on Sunday in support of Kyiv at a London summit, where they pledged to spend more on security and assemble a coalition to defend any truce in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  And French President Emmanuel Macron, flying back from the summit, said in a newspaper interview that France and Britain wanted to propose a partial one-month truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which brought together 18 allies, came just two days after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in front of reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain, France "and others" would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, which they would then put to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London meeting came at a delicate moment for war-battered Ukraine, facing uncertain US backing and on the back foot against Russia's three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's row with Zelensky also raised fresh questions over the US commitment to Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Europe found itself "at a crossroads in history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a moment for more talk - it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  With no guarantee of US involvement, "Europe must do the heavy lifting", Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries were ready to help defend any truce, he added - without naming them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron, in an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, said he and Starmer were working on a one-month truce in Ukraine, "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was warmly embraced by many of the world leaders at the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the UK leader's Downing Street home, people gathered to show their support for Ukraine, some dressed in the country's blue and yellow national colours. (AFP)

    HK to push for greater integration at Two Sessions

<img alt="Closewise from top right, Starry Lee, Ronick Chan, William Wong and Johnny Ng are among the delegates attending the Two Sessions in Beijing.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates attending the "Two Sessions" meetings this year said they're looking to make a range of proposals – from the development of artificial intelligence to a low-altitude economy – as the SAR seeks to further integrate into the nation's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be joining the country's largest annual political gatherings in Beijing this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker and local CPPCC member, Johnny Ng, told RTHK that he expects Beijing to put forward initiatives on technology – especially AI – in light of the emergence of DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays we have DeepSeek, this is open source. Open source means different industries can leverage AI to improve their efficiency, like the healthcare industry, the legal industry, the education industry," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I expect and I suggest the government to make a clearer blueprint to every different industry to leverage the benefits of AI... The government should have a clear blueprint and make some funding support."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects cybersecurity to be a key concern for policymakers amid the country's technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker and CPPCC delegate, William Wong, called for the development of a cross-border low-altitude economy, which he sees as key to boosting cooperation in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the development of a low-altitude economy is generally considered more mature on the mainland than in the SAR, Wong believes Hong Kong can play a significant role moving forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The research part can actually be done in Hong Kong, and then the sort of prototyping, the testing part can be done in Shenzhen, for example, because one project is split between two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So during the research and development process, there will be a lot of, for example, document transfer. There may be experimental samples transfer or even equipment transfer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stronger cross-border cooperation could also be on the cards when it comes to biotech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, said the Hetao zone is a major technology hub for the SAR, and the city should make good use of it and step up cooperation with the mainland, to help boost the country's overall biotech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member said the mainland could send its blood products to Hong Kong, so the SAR can capitalise on its advantage in medical research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financing for businesses is another key topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local NPC deputy, Ronick Chan, said many mainland enterprises, especially those in Qianhai, want to tap the Hong Kong loan market, but it's difficult for them to do so right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wants to expand the loan quotas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put in place a total quota in respect of how the Qianhai enterprises could borrow from Hong Kong's financial institutions, and also Hong Kong's companies and enterprises could also borrow from Qianhai's financial institutions. This kind of liberation, I expect, could accelerate the cross-border fund flow and also be beneficial to Hong Kong's loan growth," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other delegates at the "Two Sessions" said they'd like to see more support for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Stanley Ng wants more mainland tourists to be able to visit Hong Kong via the multi-entry visa scheme, which only covers Shenzhen residents at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the scheme will cover residents in Guangzhou before expanding further to other cities in the Greater Bay Area in future.

    'Kai Tak Stadium makes Hong Kong a hot destination'

<img alt="Lawmaker Adrian Ho says Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park went smoothly. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793928_1_20250303081026.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Monday said the Kai Tak Stadium places Hong Kong on the map as a "hot destination" for major concerts and events, after the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opened over the weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Adrian Ho was among the tens of thousands of people who attended the ceremony, where spectators were treated to a dazzling performance featuring athletes and celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said organisers of major events will now take notice of Hong Kong's brand new facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really never had a sort of internationally up-to-standard arena until right now. So I believe that we would be a very hot destination to host events not only just locally, but internationally too," the New People's Party member told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the size of the stadium is a draw, adding that international stars prefer to perform at newer facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Almost all organisers prefer sort of newer arenas. So I mean, this is the newest and hottest arena... If you look at events around the world everybody wants to go to a newer arena because of more state-of-the-art technology, technological advancements in terms of equipment, infrastructure, it's newer, it's better, so to speak, so I think for that matter... we're at an advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also said Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park -- which featured a fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau -- went smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a huge event, and I think all of the expectations that I had prior to the event in terms of security, arrangements, the audience, as well as the programme, pretty much met my expectations," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was great."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United's dismal season hit a new low as the FA Cup holders crashed out after a 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat against Fulham in the fifth round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's side trailed to Calvin Bassey's first-half opener at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised to force a 1-1 draw after extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham keeper Bernd Leno was the hero in the shoot-out as he saved from Victor Lindelof and Joshua Zirkzee, with the visitors converting all four of their kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booed off at half-time, it was another wretched result for United in a season that sees them languishing in 14th place in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13-time FA Cup winners had reached the final for the last two seasons and beat Manchester City to lift the trophy last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be no trip to Wembley this season for United, who have only the Europa League left as a silverware chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard. We had the best chances in the game but in the end the penalties can go both ways and today it was not our day," Amorim said. "I know that we are losing games and losing trophies during this season but the goal is to win the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how long it's going to take," he added. "But if you think like that, we can suffer a little bit in these defeats."
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been another testing week at Old Trafford, with 200 job cuts announced and United struggling to draw with Everton and barely beat lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim admitted that life is "hard" just now for United and this was the latest hammer blow to the under-fire Portuguese coach, who only arrived in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head to Real Sociedad for the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday before hosting Arsenal in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Amorim to realise United were in for another dispiriting afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund fired over from an acute angle after Christian Eriksen's cross found the much-maligned United striker, whose goalless drought has now reached 18 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eriksen's curler was fisted away by Leno, but that did little to satisfy fans frustrated by years of underachievement. (AFP)

<img alt="Relatives mourn two Palestinians killed in a reported Israeli strike in the northern Gaza Strip, as a truce hangs in the balance. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793904_1_20250302212847.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza said four people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli attacks on Sunday after the first phase of a fragile truce in the territory drew to a close.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Since this morning, four dead and six wounded" have been brought to "hospitals in the Gaza Strip following Israeli attacks in various parts of the territory", the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that it struck suspects planting an "explosive device" in northern Gaza as the first phase of a fragile ceasefire with Hamas ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel and Hamas to maintain their ceasefire in Gaza to prevent the conflict-weary region from sinking back into despair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire agreement has saved countless lives and offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering. Any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair," it said in a statement, adding the truce was "essential."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came as Israel said it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza and as deadly attacks were reported in the territory after Israel and Hamas hit an impasse of how to proceed further.

  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged on Sunday the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire deal, calling on the European Union to pressure Israel to enforce it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January," Abdelatty said at a press conference in Cairo, urging the EU to exert "maximum pressure on the parties, especially the Israeli party, regarding commitment to the ceasefire agreement".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for more than two weeks with double pneumonia, on Sunday thanked believers around the world for their "support" and "affection" as he missed delivering a third straight Angelus prayer in person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been treated at the Gemelli hospital in Rome since February 14, missed the traditional weekly prayer, which instead was published in the form of a letter the Vatican released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world. I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all," wrote the Argentine pontiff.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by calling for peace in addressing conflicts around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray above all for peace. From here, war appears even more absurd. Let us pray for tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu," the pope wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Vatican, the pope spent "a calm night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is still resting," the Holy See said earlier in its latest health update on the head of the Catholic Church.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, it had said the pope's condition was "stable", adding that he was still receiving oxygen, had no fever, had been eating, was alert and praying. (AFP)

<img alt="Henry Tang, a member of the CPPCC Standing Committee, says he will put forward ideas on allowing Greater Bay Area residents more access to HK's financial system.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local delegate to the country’s top advisory body plans to ask for measures on facilitating people flow within the Greater Bay Area, during the upcoming “Two Sessions” meetings in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tang, who is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member, came up with a number of proposals on better integrating Hong Kong into the country’s development and the Greater Bay Area, as well as leveraging the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former chief secretary hoped the central government would expand the multiple-entry visa scheme currently in place for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one “new concept”, as he put it, would be on enriching the financial system on a closed-loop basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like I’m proposing to open up a giant back door to undermine the currency controls of the country, but to allow the people in the Greater Bay Area to take much better advantage of the financial instruments available in Hong Kong that are otherwise unavailable to the Shenzhen residents,” he said in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang said the latest budget blueprint unveiled by the SAR government had focused on stability, calling it “commendable and reasonable”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you look at it from three basic principles — first is stability, second is development, and third is investing for future — they have all three parts in it,” said Tang, who formerly served as financial secretary himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Generally, it is an acceptable budget, in that aspect, and that three years is a reasonably period for a forecast to return to a budget surplus.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s latest budget, he stressed containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and France will work with Ukraine on a plan to end the fighting with Russia, which will later be presented to the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States," Starmer told British media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer hosted Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Sunday for a summit on the conflict, which has taken on huge significance in the wake of the clash between the Ukrainian president and US counterpart Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said "nobody wants to see" the scenes of the two leaders' White House clash, and that "I am clear in my mind that he (Trump) does want a lasting peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister has presented himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe, and met with Trump in Washington on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will come again if he's given the opportunity to do so..., which is why I've been so centrally focused on what a guarantee is. How do we defend the line if a line is agreed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Where that physical line would be is "a subject for discussion", said Starmer. (AFP)

    Private US spaceship lands on Moon

<img alt="A US company successfully landed its spacecraft on the Moon on Sunday, marking only the second private mission to achieve the milestone. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793887_1_20250302174506.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefly Aerospace became the second US company to land on the moon on Sunday with its debut Blue Ghost lander, kicking off a two-week research mission as one of a handful of private firms to reach the frontlines of a global moon race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight controllers at Firefly's Austin, Texas headquarters watched as Blue Ghost descended toward the moon's surface at a gentle two miles per hour, confirming on a live stream that the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're on the moon," declared Will Coogan, Blue Ghost Chief Engineer at Firefly Aerospace, from mission control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefly became the second private firm to score a soft moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and, last year, Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every single thing was clockwork, even when we landed, and then after, we saw everything was stable and upright," Firefly CEO Jason Kim said on stage at a company watch event in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the audience were hundreds of Firefly employees, space industry officials and senior Nasa leaders, including the agency's acting administrator Janet Petro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Firefly's in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two navigation cameras onboard Blue Ghost were used to spot hazards on the lunar surface during its final descent, helping the spacecraft steer toward an ideal landing spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impact sensors on the craft's four carbon-composite legs triggered Blue Ghost's engine to shutdown upon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two solar panels on the side and one of the top will power the lander and its research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus minus 173 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed by Nasa and its flagship Artemis moon programme, private companies are playing an outsized role in the modern moon race with the hopes of stimulating a lunar market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 for the first time since 1972. (Reuters)

    Israel suspends entry of supplies into Gaza

File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793880_1_20250302160735.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday slammed Israel's suspension of supplies and aid entering Gaza, describing it as a "war crime" and a violation of the ceasefire agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement", the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced earlier on Sunday that it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza, and threatened "consequences" for Hamas if it did not accept a proposal for a temporary extension of the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended," his office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will not accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists with its refusal, there will be other consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said earlier on Sunday that it supported a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, or April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the proposal came from the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopia dominated the competition at the Tokyo Marathon on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's categories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tadese Takele won the men's race in a time of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 23 seconds on Sunday as Uganda's double Olympic track champion Joshua Cheptegei finished ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele broke clear of the pack with around four kilometres to go in warm conditions to claim his first major marathon title, shaving a second off his previous personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele's compatriot Deresa Geleta was second in 2:03:51, with Kenya's Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich third in 2:04:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The weather wasn't a problem, it wasn't too hot and for me it was comfortable," said Takele.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The course was good and this was a great day for me. In the future, I hope to run even better than I did today."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's race, Ethiopia's Sutume Asefa Kebede defended her title, finishing in 2 hours, 16 minutes, 31 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya's Winfridah Moraa Moseti was second in 2:16:56, with Ethiopia's Hawi Feysa third in 2:17:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheptegei, who won gold in both the Tokyo Olympics 5,000m in 2021 and the 10,000m in Paris last year, was running his second marathon after making his debut at the distance in Valencia two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old finished in a time of 2:05:59.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, who was running her first marathon in 10 years at the age of 51, finished in a time of 2:57:26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Radcliffe also plans to run the Boston Marathon next month. (AFP)
