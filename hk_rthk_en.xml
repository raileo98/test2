<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers resumed a search operation on Wednesday for people missing after flash floods and landslides on Indonesia’s main island of Java that killed at least 17 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waters from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in Petungkriyono resort area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhari said at least 17 people were dead, nine were missing and 13 injured by Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted on Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and, whenever possible, survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scores of rescue personnel were searching through a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a café to search for at least nine people reported missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed personnel digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has called on countries to promote collaboration among public, private and philanthropic sectors so as to encourage private investments in green and transition projects.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, he joined a breakfast meeting organised by the Giving to Amplify Earth Action launched by the WEF.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that there was a significant funding gap globally in responding to climate change and highlighted Hong Kong's role as a leading green finance hub in Asia, gathering financial institutions, professional services and talent with relevant expertise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the thriving ecosystem of family offices, private equity funds, wealth and asset management was conducive to connecting wealth with climate transition projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  He briefed attendees at a luncheon meeting on Hong Kong's latest economic situation and development strategies, highlighting its collaboration with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan met the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Daren Tang, to exchange views on strengthening cooperation in areas such as intellectual property protection and talent training.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also met the United Arab Emirates' foreign trade minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to discuss bilateral cooperation in finance and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his attendance at Davos, Chan has highlighted Hong Kong's unique advantages, such as its role as a "super connector" and "super value-adder" between mainland China and the world, saying this creates opportunities for global businesses and investors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that asks government agency chiefs to combat Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies in federal agencies, contracting and the private sector, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order also encouraged the private sector to "end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences," the White House added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The action outlined in an Office of Personnel Management memorandum came one day after Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity programmes, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and other traditionally under-represented groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programmes will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the memorandum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a “reduction-in-force action” against those federal workers. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, Australia, India and Japan recommitted to working together on Tuesday, after the first meeting of the Quad grouping's top diplomats since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement after the talks in Washington, hosted by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on his first day in the job, the four nations said officials would meet regularly to prepare for an upcoming leaders' summit in India, expected this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio earlier said he said would stress the importance of working with allies "on the things that are important to America and Americans" during the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He posed with Australia's Penny Wong, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japan's Takeshi Iwaya in front of the flags of their countries before the meeting at the State Department, but did not respond to questions from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant that the Quad (foreign ministers' meeting) took place within hours of the inauguration of the Trump Administration," Jaishankar said on X after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This underlines the priority it has in the foreign policy of its member states."
  <br>
  <br>
  The four nations restated their "shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended," the joint statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also met separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Wong told a news conference in Washington she had a "very positive discussion" with Rubio on Aukus, a trilateral security partnership that also involves the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and a political tool for the US to contain China and maintain its hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has also said the Aukus alliance would intensify a regional arms race and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Travel Industry Council, Fanny Yeung, on Wednesday said Greater Bay Airlines' move to cancel scores of flights in the coming weeks won't have a significant impact, given the city's overall capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers are believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the move, which mostly affects its services to Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of affected passengers is around 5,000 plus, so it's still a very minor share when we compare with the overall flight capacity. So I don't think that will have a significant impact," Yeung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, the company should take steps to avoid a repeat of such issues, Yeung added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the low-cost carrier apologised for the cancellations and said it has already contacted customers regarding rebookings and refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An internal review in this matter has been carried out immediately and negligence was found in our flight scheduling process. We have also taken immediate action to tighten up the relevant approval procedure for flight scheduling," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said no flights over the Lunar New Year are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier added that it is considering dropping its flights to Seoul because of unsatisfactory performance.

    Guidelines to help govt staff uphold national security

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said a set of guidelines will be introduced in the first quarter of this year, allowing public officers to better understand their responsibilities on safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's Policy Address stated that all government bureaux and departments must review guidelines to ensure compliance with provisions in the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Tang said the guidelines would provide clear explanations on 20 categories of national security and how they relate to officers' work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public officers not only have to make considerations of national security at work, but they also have to be proactive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them don't fully understand that, so we will introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of 2025, using plain language and examples, instead of legal terms, to make explanations."
  <br>
  <br>
  An example cited by Tang is how government procurement may be affected by foreign sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a cross-border emergency-response mechanism established last year strengthening collaboration between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, the security minister said up to two large-scale drills are held every year, while small-scale ones take place more frequently.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama has complained to the United Nations over US President Donald Trump's "worrying" threat to seize the Panama Canal, even as it launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two ports on the inter-oceanic waterway.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the government in Panama City referred to an article of the UN Charter precluding any member from "the threat or use of force" against the territorial integrity or political independence of another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missive distributed to reporters on Tuesday urges Guterres to refer the matter to the UN Security Council, without asking for a meeting to be convened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities then announced an "exhaustive audit" would be launched to ensure the "efficient and transparent use of public resources" at the Panama Ports Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, part of Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comptroller's office said the aim was to determine whether the company was complying with its concession agreements, including adequate reporting of income, payments and contributions to the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said operated on the principle of neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," Mulino said in response to Trump's threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Ports Company's concession agreement was extended by 25 years in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the canal's main user, followed by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2000, the waterway has contributed more than US$30 billion to Panama's state coffers, including nearly US$2.5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP)

    Ichiro becomes first Japanese into MLB Hall of Fame

<img alt="Suzuki at an MLB game between the Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics at Tokyo Dome in 2019. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788618_1_20250122095830.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ichiro Suzuki, whose uncanny hitting talent made him a Seattle Mariners icon after he'd established himself as a star in Japan, has become the first Japanese player elected to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro headlines the 2025 Hall of Fame class to be enshrined at Cooperstown, New York, which also includes pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player, as opposed to a pitcher, to play in the US major leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won both American League Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year honors that year, going on to earn 10 All-Star nods, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished his career with 3,089 hits in MLB – on top of 1,278 he piled up in nine years in Japan. His 4,367 hits as a professional are the most of any player in baseball history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He amassed two batting titles, 1,420 runs and 509 stolen bases in more than 19 Major League seasons while expanding the horizons for Japanese players aiming to make the move Stateside when some still doubted that their skills would translate to MLB.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004 Ichiro won his second batting title and broke George Sisler's 84-year-old record with 262 hits – part of a stretch of 10 straight seasons with at least 200 hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first year of eligibility, the 51-year-old Ichiro fell one ballot shy of unanimous election – something achieved to date only by Yankees pitching great Mariano Rivera. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump voiced his latest tariff threats in remarks to reporters at the White House a day after taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs," Trump said of the EU. "You can't get fairness unless you do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would "straighten that out" by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10 percent tariff, saying it was "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: "Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc was ready to defend its interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remained an important partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's "first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate" with Trump, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs, mainland media accused him of blaming China for Washington's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US, while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has spoken out against protectionism, saying no one wins in a trade war. (AFP)

    Trump 'open' to Elon Musk buying TikTok

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788608_1_20250122091017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would be open to tech billionaire Elon Musk - the owner of social media platform X - buying Chinese-owned app TikTok.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump told reporters when asked if he was open to Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, acquiring the video-sharing platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before he took office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive order directed his attorney general to delay the implementation of the law for 75 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  To save the company's US operations, Trump on Monday also floated the idea of a 50-50 partnership between "the United States" and its Chinese owner ByteDance, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Tuesday if his phone had TikTok, which is banned on US government devices, Trump said: "No, but... I think I'll get it right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the tacit co-operation of Oracle, its server provider, TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday crediting Trump's commitment to save the app for making the reversal possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if existing users can still enjoy TikTok, Apple and Google have still not made the app available in their app stores, therefore denying downloads to new users as well as updates to those who have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user if the app is accessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a report that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok. (AFP)

    Trump highlights billion-dollar AI partnership

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Japanese tech behemoth SoftBank Group soared more than eight per cent on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a major investment to build AI infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called "Stargate", set to launch in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool beat Lille 2-1 to maintain their perfect record in this season's Champions League and clinch qualification for the last 16, while Barcelona produced a stunning comeback to beat Benfica 5-4 in a classic to secure their own place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Anfield side are the only team with a maximum 21 points from seven matches in this new, expanded Champions League and they now know they will skip next month's play-offs and head straight to the last 16 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah ran clear to give Liverpool the lead at home to a Lille team who have also impressed this season, and the visitors appeared in trouble when they had Aissa Mandi sent off just before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan David swept in an equaliser for Lille, but Harvey Elliott's shot took a wicked deflection on its way in to give Liverpool the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy that we are top eight. That's the only thing that tells me something, because this league table doesn't tell you anything," said Slot when asked about being through to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the biggest drama on the night, however, came in the rain in Lisbon, where Barcelona trailed 4-2 with 12 minutes of the 90 remaining, but somehow recovered to win 5-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greek striker Vangelis Pavlidis scored a hat-trick in the first half-hour for Benfica, including a penalty, while Robert Lewandowski netted from the spot for Barca, who were 3-1 down at the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha pulled it back to 3-2 when a clearance by the goalkeeper ricocheted back off the Brazilian's head and in, but a Ronald Araujo own goal midway through the second half appeared to have secured the win for the Portuguese side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another Lewandowski penalty on 78 minutes gave Barcelona renewed hope, and Eric Garcia headed in the equaliser on 86 minutes, before Raphinha ran away to settle an incredible game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mentality of the team, they always believe in themselves and this was unbelievable to see," said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans are second with six wins out of seven, and will finish in the top eight to go straight to the last 16. Benfica, with 10 points, must still sweat to reach the play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Atlético Madrid are third on 15 points and certain to at least be in the play-offs after a Julián Alvarez brace secured a 2-1 home victory over Bayer Leverkusen in a game both teams finished with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico had Pablo Barrios sent off midway through the first half, and Piero Hincapie then put Leverkusen ahead just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina star Alvarez levelled seven minutes into the second half, and Hincapie was sent off for the Germans before another Alvarez goal won it for the home side in the last minute as they climbed above Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's Europa League winners Atalanta are also guaranteed at least a play-off place after crushing Sturm Graz of Austria 5-0. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks jumped on Tuesday as markets greeted early moves by US President Donald Trump that raised hopes new tariffs won't be as bad as feared.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's first day back in the White House included a litany of executive actions, but while he threatened new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the trade announcements were "more benign than expected," said a note from Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other analysts pointed out that Trump did not announce immediate tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 percent at 44,025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 6,049, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent to 19,756.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's gains came as US Treasury yields edged lower, a sign investors remain less perturbed by inflation worries following last week's consumer price data.
  <br>
  <br>
  While several large technology companies moved higher, an exception was Apple, which slumped 3.2 percent following a report of weak China sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive fell 6.5 percent following a Trump executive order that takes aim at programs favoring EVs. EV charging companies ChargePoint Holdings and EVgo also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dow member 3M gained 4.2 percent as it reported better than expected profits. William Brown, CEO of the industrial products company, pointed to strong sales momentum, saying "we are confident in our ability to deliver our 2025 guidance." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A vintage Novak Djokovic tamed Carlos Alcaraz in a late-night blockbuster to set up an Australian Open semi-final with Alexander Zverev as two-time women's defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fought on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic rolled back the years at the scene of his greatest achievements on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph sealed close to 1:00 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb surged into the semi-finals and a date with world number two Zverev to edge closer to an 11th Melbourne crown and all-time record 25th Slam title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just wish that this match today was the final," said Djokovic, who had to have his thigh heavily strapped and appeared to be labouring at the end of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just one of the most epic matches I have played on this court, any court really," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With former rival Andy Murray now in his coaching corner, Djokovic was at his imperious and defiant best, cupping his ear to the crowd after winning big points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic was at the centre of a row on Monday after he demanded an apology – and got one – from a local TV presenter for what he called "insulting and offensive comments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's world number three Alcaraz will have to wait another year to get a kangaroo tattoo. He had vowed to get one if he won the Australian Open for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old four-time major champion has still never been beyond the Melbourne Park last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  He felt he should have rammed home the advantage when Djokovic was struggling with his movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to say that was the biggest mistake that I made today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former number one Djokovic extended his career advantage over Alcaraz to 5-3, having also beaten him in the Paris Olympics final in their last meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz got the better of his rival in the 2023 and 2024 Wimbledon finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot and windy conditions, Germany's Zverev defeated the American Tommy Paul 7-6 (7/1), 7-6 (7/0), 2-6, 6-1 to step up his quest to win a Grand Slam for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old lost his cool at one point because of a feather. The umpire called for a replay when the feather drifted in front of him as he played a shot at a critical juncture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "C'mon, that is unbelievable on break point," he shouted, before taking out his fury on Paul by breaking to love.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner plays home hope Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, the winner facing American 21st seed Ben Shelton or the unseeded Italian Lorenzo Sonego.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Sabalenka will face Paula Badosa in the last four as the Belarusian bids to win the Australian Open for a third time in a row, something last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one kept that dream alive but had to battle for it in beating Russian 27th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly I was just praying, trying to put the ball back in these tough conditions," said Sabalenka. "I'm just super happy I was able to somehow magically win this match." (AFP)

<img alt="Herzi Halevi had been widely expected to step down. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788576_1_20250122051633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday he would resign on March 6, taking responsibility for the security lapse on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas fighters from Gaza carried out a cross-border attack on Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Halevi, who had been widely expected to step down in the wake of the deadliest single day in Israel's history, said he would complete the Israel Defence Forces' inquiries into October 7 and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear who would replace Halevi, who said he would transfer the IDF command to a yet-to-be-named successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite public anger over the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has resisted calls to open a state inquiry into its own responsibility for the security breach that resulted in 1,200 Israelis being killed and about 250 hostages taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address, Halevi promised a deep and transparent investigation, the details of which would be presented to the defence minister and, as much as permissible, to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior military officers have already resigned over October 7, and the head of the military's Southern Command, Major-General Yaron Finkelman, also said he would be resigning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe our prime minister should take example from the personal responsibility that the chief of staff has taken," activist Gil Ashkenazy, 60, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 46,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's war in Gaza, and the heavily built-up territory has been widely demolished by Israeli bombardments and airstrikes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a fire that engulfed a hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday rose to 76, officials said, expressing great "pain" at the tragedy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, footage showed bedsheets hanging from the windows, and media reports suggest some had died after trying to jump to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pain is great," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the resort in Kartalkaya, around 170 kilometres northwest of the capital Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out at 3:27 am (0027 GMT) in the 12-storey Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 238 guests were registered at the hotel, the minister added. It was a peak time during a two-week school holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish authorities detained four suspects including the owner of the resort hotel, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister previously announced that six prosecutors had been allocated to investigate the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private broadcaster NTV said that the dead included three people who had jumped from the hotel's windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire is believed to have started in the restaurant and spread quickly, though it was not immediately clear what caused it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the structure backs onto a cliff, making it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China and Russia should consolidate and expand bilateral relations and push for in-depth development of practical cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks when holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi stressed that in the new year, he is willing to work with Putin to continue guiding China-Russia relations towards greater heights, to cope with the uncertainties of the external environment with the stability and resilience of China-Russia relations, to jointly promote the development and revitalisation of the two countries, and to uphold international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the two sides to continue deepening strategic coordination, firming up mutual support and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said Beijing and Moscow should jointly defend the UN-centred international system and the outcomes of World War Two victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said the two countries should also uphold basic norms governing international relations and practise true multilateralism. (Xinhua)

    A trade war leaves no winners: Vice Premier Ding

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned on Tuesday that no country would emerge victorious from a trade war, in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos as Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, told the forum that a "tug of war" was underway between supporters and opponents of economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the board with imminent tariff wars and trade wars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global governance system is undergoing profound adjustments. Human society has once again come to a critical crossroads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism leads nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war," Ding said, without mentioning Trump or the US by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has also been locked in trade disputes with the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU imposed hefty tariffs on electric cars made in China last year. In turn, Beijing targeted European brandies and opened probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without mentioning the EU or any country by name, Ding warned against "erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a "consistent approach" in addressing climate change and trade policies "so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition".
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe was ready to improve ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Europe "must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest" despite escalating trade tensions between the two. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host the World Snooker Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Arena, the first ranking tournament to be held in the city since 1989.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will take place from March 4 to 9, featuring the top 32 players from around the world including Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who will be playing on home turf for the first time after becoming Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other snooker greats set to be in action include China's top player Ding Junhui, former World champions Mark Selby of England and Australian Neil Robertson, and the current World champion Kyren Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be the first formal sport event to be held in Kai Tak Arena, so there will be a lot of challenges because I don't think anyone in Hong Kong has the experience of organising something of this scale in this venue," said Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working on every single detail meticulously, especially the production, the seating plan, the scenery, the facilities for example the media room, the media centre, the other rooms for the players, a lot of things. It's not an easy task, but we are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also the first time Hong Kong will host the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Brownell, CEO of the World Snooker Tour, said it'll be a treat for both the fans and the players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be desperate to become the first to lift the historic World Grand Prix trophy in Hong Kong, and to win the historic highs prize money for this event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the local fans, it will be incredible opportunity to watch the best players on the planet and marvel at their skills. We are sure the atmosphere will be electric and it will be a fabulous experience for everyone inside the arena."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the event, exhibition matches will be held for other elite players, including local favourite Marco Fu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it promises to be a great tournament that would further promote snooker in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking back, many years ago I went to Queen Elizabeth Stadium to watch the likes of Steve Davis, Jimmy White, they played in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and that's when I really fell in love with the game of snooker," Fu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure many youngsters will come to this tournament to watch all the top players playing, and I'm sure they're going to fall in love with the game of snooker.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this tournament, more youngsters will pick up the cue and start to play snooker. It's going to be fantastic."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Tuesday announced the cancellation of flights, which could disrupt the plans of some Lunar New Year travellers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline did not specify the number of flights affected, but it's understood that more than 200 flights scheduled between January and March, mainly to Japan and South Korea, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it's helping passengers to re-book tickets or with refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will learn from the experience and review the relevant arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said all fees will be waived to reduce the possible impact on people's travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight cancellations sparked a backlash on social media, with would-be holidaymakers complaining that their travel plans have been disrupted in a Facebook group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport secretary Mable Chan expressed deep concern and requested a detailed report.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said the Transport and Logistics Bureau will meet with airline representatives to understand the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, said 11 tour groups heading to Tokushima, Japan, after February 10 will be affected, involving more than 100 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, we give customers options. They can choose to switch to other destinations. If they cannot find a suitable alternative due to flight disruption, we usually provide a full refund," Huen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen Chun-ning, executive director of WWPKG Holdings, said five tour groups going to Sendai in March will have to be cancelled, with around 100 people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers can reschedule or choose to cancel for a full refund, Yuen said.

 Immigration officials on Tuesday said seven mainland visitors were jailed for up to two months each for working illegally in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The jail sentences came after officers arrested eight people this month who provided illegal tour guide services and acted as "shopping agents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven earlier appeared at Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts and at Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Courts, and admitted they had breached their condition of stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were given 54 days to two months in jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said one case is still under investigation, and there could be more arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said four women acted as tour guides in Hong Kong. They arranged guided visits for their guests to different tourist attractions in the city, and took photos for them, at an hourly rate of HK$100 to HK$300.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the other four men, officers said they acted as “shopping agents” by buying food and necessities at supermarkets and restaurants on the mainland, and delivered the goods to customers in Hong Kong. They could earn anywhere between HK$100 and HK$200 for each transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four men and four women, aged between 19 and 52, were arrested in Hong Kong between January 13 and Monday, after officers posed as customers and reserved services from them through social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Department deputy commander Leung Tsz-chung reminded citizens to be wary of such services.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When choosing those services, people have to be careful and vigilant, and to make sure the service providers can be employed legally in Hong Kong. Otherwise, people may face criminal liability,” Leung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lunar New Year fireworks display on the second day of the Year of the Snake will feature patterns of pandas, smiley faces and gold ingots, organisers said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-minute show, divided into nine scenes, will light up Victoria Harbour from 8pm on January 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said 23,888 pyrotechnic shells will be launched from three barges, opening with a lucky number eight and a scene entitled "A Brand New Beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Mao, CEO of Pyromagic Multimedia Productions, said the eighth scene is the highlight of the show, featuring patterns of six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The six panda heads symbolise the family of pandas that are now in Hong Kong. Two of which are newborns, a very happy moment for Hong Kong, and also China has given Hong Kong two pandas. Along with the two natives that are always in Hong Kong, we have a family of six," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao described the extravaganza here as "one of a kind".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very beautiful backdrop, and to feature a fireworks display in this beautiful backdrop is one of a kind. There's nowhere in the world that can beat this beautiful backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fireworks in Guangzhou, they don't have a backdrop like in Hong Kong... Hong Kong is certainly world famous, the fireworks event held here is always number one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators can listen to RTHK Radio 4 for synchronised music during the show.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in December compared to the same month the year before, official figures showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the same rate as seen in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said underlying inflation, which nets out the effects of the government's one-off relief measures, rose 1.3 percent year-on-year, slightly higher than the 1.2 percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices for alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increase last month, rising 21.2 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was followed by the prices for electricity, gas, and water, which rose 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clothing and footwear prices fell, however, by 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said underlying consumer price inflation remained modest last month, with prices of major components broadly in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain moderate in the near term. As the Hong Kong economy continues to grow, domestic cost may see some upward pressures. External price pressures should remain contained, though uncertainties from the external environment warrant attention," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 2024 as a whole, overall consumer prices were 1.7 percent higher than in the previous year, while the underlying inflation rate stood at 1.1 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China installed a record amount of renewable energy in 2024, data from the National Energy Administration (NEA) showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has committed to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation added about 277 gigawatts (GW) of solar last year, an increase from the 217 GW added from the previous year, the NEA said in a statement. It also expanded its wind power by nearly 80 GW.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total installed capacity of solar and wind power were around 887 GW and 521 GW respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping in 2020 set a target for at least 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity installed by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  China surpassed this target last year, almost six years earlier than planned, data from the NEA in August showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  And it has built almost twice as much wind and solar capacity as every other country combined, according to research published in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing invested over US$50 billion in new solar supply capacity from 2011 to 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar industry has also benefited from access to cheap raw materials, readily available capital from state-owned banks, and huge engineering manpower. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland student from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is suspected to have lost around HK$1.8 million in a phone scam, sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the woman, 22, got a phone call last August from someone pretending to be from the SAR's Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammer told her she was involved in a case on the mainland and threatened to arrest her unless she opened an account at a designated bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim was asked to make six money transfers to the bank account to prove that she was innocent, sources have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Failing to contact the fraudster, she realised she had been scammed and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an email to students on Sunday, HKU said that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a total loss of HK$60 million.

    China urges US cooperation to resolve trade issues

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it hopes for cooperation with the United States to resolve trade issues, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the United States, properly manage differences and expand mutually beneficial cooperation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States will work with China to jointly promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday warned that he could impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico next month, but appeared to delay any action against China for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his inauguration speech, Trump did not target China nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, he directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo also said China will firmly maintain its national interests, but at the same time it is necessary for senior officials of both countries to maintain contact in an appropriate manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to a question on whether Beijing would drop its sanctions on the newly confirmed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was among a group of American officials sanctioned by China in 2020 over Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On TikTok, Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app, but said he might impose tariffs on China if Beijing does not approve a potential US deal with TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order kept TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform’s users.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump said he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between its Chinese owner ByteDance and the US government, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s CEO, attended Trump’s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised he would pause the ban, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump said he could travel to China as soon as this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if he would travel to China this year, the US leader said, "Yeah, could be. I've had the invite." (Agencies)

    At least 10 people killed in Turkish ski resort fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people were killed and another 32 injured after a fire broke out at a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out overnight at the hotel's restaurant in the resort of Kartalkaya in Bolu province, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building in a panic, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private NTV television said some people tried to climb down from their rooms using sheets.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 234 guests staying at the hotel, Aydin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor at the hotel, said he was asleep when the fire erupted and he rushed out of the building. He told NTV television that he then helped some 20 guests out of the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the hotel was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for guests to locate the fire escape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed the roof and top floors of the hotel on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the fire was not immediately known. NTV television suggested that the wooden cladding on the hotel's exterior may have accelerated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kartalkaya is a popular ski resort in the Koroglu mountains, some 300 kilometres east of Istanbul. The fire occurred during the school semester break when hotels in the region are packed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aydin's office said 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Less than a quarter of small to medium-sized companies in Hong Kong have taken adequate steps to make sure they don't fall foul of competition laws, a watchdog warned on Tuesday, adding that it has come up with a new website to help firms get the information they need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Competition Commission said a survey of around 600 companies it carried out from late 2023 to 2024 found only 24 percent of SMEs had policies in place to ensure they complied with competition regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey results suggest that the SMEs have a quite good understanding of the Competition Ordinance. At the same time, we realise they have some confusion on some details regarding the law. We found out that they may not have the necessary resources to implement compliance plans within the company," said Gary Shiu, an executive director of the commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said larger enterprises have the resources to hire professionals to provide advice on the matter, while smaller companies that don't have the money are at a greater risk of breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new platform, SME Hub, highlights key aspects of the ordinance and has an assessment tool for identifying potential risks with business activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said it also includes real-life scenarios or hypothetical examples to bust common myths surrounding the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All enterprises have some misunderstanding concerning being part of a cartel agreement or price-fixing agreements. They would always think that as long as there are no anti-competitive effects or any negative effects in the market, then why would they infringe the law?" Shiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it will also be organising talks and training for SMEs on implementing internal guidelines for the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Kwok, who chairs the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said limited resources is not the only challenge when it comes to implementing relevant guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lack of expertise, and being uncertain about the ordinance requirements make it difficult to lay out internal policies. If the details [of the law] are too complicated, SMEs may need to consult relevant lawyers for clarification," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok agreed that the new website can help SMEs understand the ordinance more thoroughly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some SMEs may have a basic understanding, but most do not fully understand the [ordinance] terms in detail and what it implies. The launch of the SME hub provides resources and guidance tailor-made for SMEs," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

    Trump orders US to leave WHO, Paris climate agreement

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump in his first day back in office on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), and from the Paris climate accord for a second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the WHO compared to China, adding: "World Health ripped us off."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organisation, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO's operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement to exit the agency, the Foreign Ministry said the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to "pause the future transfer of any United States government funds, support, or resources to the WHO" and to "identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also once again withdrew the United States from the Paris climate deal, removing the world's biggest historic emitter from global efforts to fight climate change for the second time in a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move places the United States alongside Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries in the world outside the 2015 pact, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China is concerned about the US announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity, Guo said no country can stay aloof or unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's determination and actions to actively address climate change remain consistent," he said, adding that the Chinese side will work with all parties to actively tackle the challenges of climate change. (Agencies)

    CE hopes for 'good efforts' to promote ties with Trump

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."

    'Trump's speech has imperialistic overtures'

<img alt="Josef Gregory Mahoney says Donald Trump's inauguration speech had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788447_1_20250121101535.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international relations professor on Tuesday said Donald Trump’s inauguration speech had "sort of imperialistic overtures".
 <br>
  <br>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai made the remarks on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme as the newly-sworn in US president vowed to “take back” the Panama Canal and potentially rename the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and invoked a “manifest destiny” in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if there's sort of this parallel that Trump is creating with this old 18th century idea of the US controlling the Western Hemisphere, at least the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, in as much as he's made overtures towards Greenland, Canada in terms of imperialistic overtures, but also things related to Mexico and now the Panama Canal and then renaming potentially the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if he’s creating sort of parallel with China where you have China in the South China Sea, China in the American mind trying to impose its sort of manifest destiny in East Asia.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney also pointed out that Trump made a wise move by holding back on tariffs against China, as the implementation would have roiled the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we all realised that tariffs are lose-lose at this point, that's what almost every study has confirmed,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that the biggest losers of all are American consumers who end up paying essentially inflationary prices for products as much as they have to bear the costs of the tariffs. And the United States depends much more on products from China than vice versa.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Before taking office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised Beijing for violating Hong Kong’s autonomy, saying it was now  a “semi-autonomous entity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney believes the statement will spark concerns towards how Washington will treat the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, you know, raises the spectre about whether or not the United States will start to treat Hong Kong as being part of the mainland and how that could have implications for the special status that Hong Kong has vis-a-vis the United States in terms of financial regulations,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That remains something of serious concern that we'll have to continue to watch. On the one hand, Rubio has said that he's committed to Hong Kong autonomy, but if he's decided that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous, then that raises a whole different perspective.”

 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong will strengthen cooperation with other places to try to secure the release of SAR residents being held prisoner in "scam farms" in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the moment, 10 Hongkongers are believed to be being forced to take part in fraud after being tricked into travelling to Thailand and neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday that authorities will carry out thorough investigations and work with counterparts overseas to tackle the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are a lot of players in the whole fight against this crime, including law enforcement agencies in the relevant countries. There are good networks already. The respective countries have already heightened their attention and escalated the government participation in our whole fight," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen cooperation in this area, passing intelligence across the players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on the public to be aware of different types of scams, including those that have ensnared scores of university students from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People may have heard about such cases...but still they think they won't be the victims and so they are not as alert," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have strengthened cooperation with tertiary institutions to raise awareness of financial scams among students, Lee added.

    1.4m mainland arrivals expected during LNY: John Lee

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said more than 1.4 million mainland arrivals are expected in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the administration will make comprehensive preparations to ensure travellers have a good experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inter-departmental working group, chaired by the chief secretary, will make proper arrangements based on the situation during individual festive periods and the estimated traveller numbers," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding cross-border arrangements, we need to discuss and cooperate with mainland authorities. We will look at the actual situation to see whether service hours at border checkpoints need to be extended and how long these should be. We should be announcing the details within this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said 2025 will open a new page for Hong Kong with more tourists making frequent visits to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of inbound visits saw a huge surge last year, reaching almost 45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  While mainland arrivals saw a 30 percent year-on-year increase, the growth from Southeast Asia was even more significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he expects the growth to continue in the coming year, with more new air routes to be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chief executive also announced that twin panda cubs at Ocean Park will make their public debut on February 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said there would be a naming contest for the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope everyone can share the joy of this big family, so having a naming contest will make it even more joyful and warm. Details will be announced soon," he said.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan arrived in Davos, Switzerland on Monday for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting where he expressed his desire to expedite a free trade agreement between Hong Kong and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan met Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the council's secretary-general, to discuss strengthening bilateral trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FS said both parties acknowledged that the launch of the "Gulf Cooperation Council Chapter" at the Asian Financial Forum last week marked a significant step forward in strengthening financial services cooperation between Hong Kong and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government is committed to facilitating two-way business delegation visits to enhance collaboration in digital economy, green transformation, securities markets, Islamic finance, and asset and wealth management with Arab states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also met several finance and business leaders from Europe, America, the Middle East and Japan and promoted the SAR's advantages as a "super connector" and "super value-adder".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he briefed the leaders on Hong Kong's recent economic and social developments, highlighting progress in the local financial market last year and achievements in attracting businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised strategies to advance finance, innovation and technology, trade and aviation and create global opportunities for businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan met the chair of Revolut, a UK-based fintech company specialising in digital banking services, to discuss the latest developments in the field and to encourage the company to expand its operations in Hong Kong.

    Badosa stuns Gauff to reach Aussie Open semi-finals

<img alt="Badosa (R) greets Coco Gauff after her quarter-final victory in the Australian Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788455_1_20250121110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An "emotional" Paula Badosa shattered world number three Coco Gauff's dream of a first Australian Open title when she stunned her 7-5, 6-4 in the quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badosa reached a Slam semi-final for the first time in her career -- the first Spanish woman to do so since Garbine Muguruza at Melbourne in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a bit emotional," said Badosa, who will face either two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a very emotional person. I wanted to play my best game. I think I did it – I'm super proud of the level I gave today," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a remarkable comeback to tennis for the 11th seed, who was ranked outside the top 100 a year ago after a stress fracture in her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean, a year ago, I was here with my back that I didn't know if I had to retire from this sport, and now I'm here playing against the best in the world," said Badosa. "I won today. I'm in a semi final. So I would never think that a year after I would be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third seed Gauff had been unbeaten in nine matches this season, but dropped her first set of 2025 before recovering to beat Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa began aggressively and had the Gauff serve under pressure early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff was serving at 5-5 30-40 when the Spaniard got the breakthrough on her third break-point opportunity and served out to take the opener in 56 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American, uncharacteristically, failed to create any break points in the first set and littered her game with unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa was relentless at the start of the second set in a marathon first game that lasted for 14 minutes and went to eight deuces. Gauff saved four break points but a fifth proved costly as the American went long to drop her serve again.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rasping running forehand winner and a backhand at the net put Gauff on the board and fired her up as broke back to level at 2-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Badosa powered to another two breaks and secured the match in one hour and 43 minutes, falling to the court in celebration as she registered her first win over a top-10 opponent at a Grand Slam in four attempts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning NBA champions Boston Celtics crushed the Golden State Warriors 125-85 as current league leaders Cleveland romped past the Phoenix Suns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tatum scored 22 points with nine rebounds and seven assists before sitting out the entire fourth quarter of the Celtics' dominant victory in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and Jaylen Brown chipped in 17 for Boston, who took full advantage of the absence of Draymond Green, the latest Warriors injury victim after he strained his left calf on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are some of the tricky games in the NBA, when teams have some star players out, other guys get a different role," Tatum said. "We fell victim to that a couple of times this year, so we were just trying to lock in from the beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up by 15 at halftime, the Celtics erupted for 43 points in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Curry scored 18 points to lead the Warriors and Moses Moody added 13 off the bench – the only Golden State players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was just one of the lopsided results as the NBA marked the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday with a day-long slate of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to fuel the Cavaliers in a 118-92 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury absences of Evan Mobley, Isaac Okoro and Caris LeVert did nothing to slow the Cavs, who led by as many as 32 on the way to boosting their league-best record to 36-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing was this was a group effort," Mitchell said. "Everybody contributed at a high level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Durant scored 33 points with seven rebounds to lead the Suns, but Devin Booker – who had scored at least 30 points in the Suns' last five games – was held to 15 points on six-of-14 shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to help the Memphis Grizzlies rally from a 16-point deficit to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-106.
  <br>
  <br>
  Desmond Bane added 22 points and Ja Morant scored 19 for Memphis, who were still down by five going into the fourth quarter and took their first lead of the second half on Bane's floater in the lane with 3:21 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was ugly from the start, but we kept competing and found a way down the stretch," Bane said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 32 points to lead the Timberwolves, but missed a potential game-winning three-pointer as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, New York's Jalen Brunson scored 34 points to propel the Knicks to a 119-110 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 27 points, leading seven Hawks players to score in double figures, but Atlanta saw their three-game winning streak end.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte, LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges scored 23 points apiece as the Hornets used a balanced scoring effort to hold off Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks 110-105.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving scored 14 of his 33 points in the final frame and Daniel Gafford finished with a career-high 31 points and 15 rebounds, but with Luka Doncic still sidelined by a calf injury, the Mavericks lost for the fourth time in their last five games. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's embattled Country Garden jumped as much as 11 percent in resumed trade on Tuesday following a more than nine-month trading suspension to give time for the developer to prepare delayed financial statements for 2023 and 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a lawyer for Country Garden, once China's biggest developers, told a Hong Kong court that the company expected to reach terms with creditors next month regarding the restructuring of US$16.4 billion in offshore debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock had been suspended from trading since April 2 pending the publication of its 2023 full-year and 2024 interim financial reports after it defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong-based Country Garden has now been granted an adjournment until May 26 in a court hearing held to gauge the extent to which its debt restructuring is proceeding ahead of a decision on a liquidation petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Country Garden were up 11 percent in early trade on Tuesday at HK$0.54, compared with its last trading price of HK$0.485 before the suspension in April. (Reuters)

    Trump pardons over 1,500 people for Jan 6 riots

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, in a show of solidarity with supporters who stormed the seat of American power in his name.
 <br>
  <br>
  The far-reaching action also cuts short the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations, including some who were convicted of seditious conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also directs the US attorney general to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What they've done to these people is outrageous," Trump, a Republican, told reporters in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are the hostages - approximately 1,500 people - for a pardon, full pardon," he said at a signing ceremony shortly after arriving at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they come out tonight frankly," he said. "They're expecting it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, whose first term as president ended under the cloud of the Capitol assault, has repeatedly played down the unprecedented violence of January 6, even going so far as to describe it as a "day of love."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 race. He then encouraged the crowd to march on Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged by special counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the case never made it to trial, and was dropped under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest figures from the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, 1,583 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol siege, including 608 accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the former leader of the Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, said he expected his client to be released from federal prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tarrio is serving a 22-year sentence, the longest of anyone criminally charged in the riot, for seditious conspiracy. He was found guilty of plotting to violently oppose the transfer of power after the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for Tarrio's co-defendant, Joe Biggs, said he was also told by an intermediary that Biggs is being processed for release. Biggs, who held a senior post in the Proud Boys, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Constitution gives presidents broad pardon power and there is no legal mechanism for challenging a presidential pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, before leaving office on Monday, issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, retired general Mark Milley and close family members to shield them from "politically-motivated prosecutions" by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden gave similar pardons to former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney and other members of the congressional committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just minutes before Trump was sworn in, Biden announced he was issuing pardons to his brother James Biden, James's wife Sara Jones Biden, his sister Valerie Biden Owens, Valerie's husband John Owens, and his brother Francis Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windy and dry conditions returned to Southern California on Monday, raising the risk of new wildfires sparking as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area that started in similar weather nearly two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gusts could peak at 113 kph along the coast and 160 kph in the mountains and foothills during extreme fire weather that is expected to last through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued a warning of a “particularly dangerous situation” for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon until Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities urged people not to mow their lawns to prevent sparking a fire, nor start any fires that could get out of control.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also asked residents to review their evacuation plans and ready emergency kits and be on the lookout for any new blazes and report them quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the biggest concerns are the Palisades and Eaton Fires breaking their containment lines and a new blaze starting.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Don’t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,” Acuna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on January 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades fire was 59 per cent contained on Monday and the Eaton fire 87 per cent contained, according to fire officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, who was sworn in as US president on Monday, has said he will be visiting the fire-ravaged areas at the end of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trip could include an awkward encounter with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been the target of Trump's barbs over his handling of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of "excess rain and snow melt from the North."
  <br>
  <br>
  In reality, Los Angeles' water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins further east. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous, rural area of Taiwan's south on Tuesday, according to China Earthquake Networks Centre (CENC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-seven people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake hit at 12:17am local time, with its epicentre at a depth of 14km, the CENC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were felt in Taipei, lasting for over 10 seconds, and several aftershocks occurred after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of deaths from the quake, though rescuers were still assessing damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those injured were six people, including one child, who were rescued from a collapsed house in Nanxi District in the city of Tainan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 900 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Monday, the United Nations said, exceeding the daily target outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian aid continues to move into the Gaza Strip as part of a prepared surge to increase support to survivors," the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, 915 trucks crossed into Gaza, according to information received through engagement with Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout the conflict in Gaza, the UN has denounced obstacles restricting the flow and distribution of aid into the battered Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the day the ceasefire came into force, 630 trucks entered Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is meant to enable a surge of sorely needed aid for Gaza after 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement calls for 600 trucks to cross into Gaza per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas said on Monday it would next release hostages held in Gaza on Saturday, after an official with the Palestinian militant group had said they would be released a day later than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas is set to release more than 90 hostages over the coming weeks as part of the ceasefire deal. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City have announced the signing of Uzbekistan centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov from French club Lens for a reported fee of US$42 million plus add-ons.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov, the first player from Uzbekistan to join a Premier League club, has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at the Etihad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This squad is full of the best players in the world and I can't wait to meet them and play alongside them," said the 20-year-old, who has 18 international caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course Pep Guardiola is one of the greatest coaches ever and I am so excited to learn from him and improve my game even more," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a young defender, Abdukodir is already very intelligent, as well as being strong, aggressive and extremely quick," City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said. "Working with Pep will only make him better and, speaking to him, he is determined to keep improving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov's deal keeps him at the Etihad until the end of the 2028 to 2029 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City are fourth in the table after a 6-0 win at Ipswich on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signing gives Guardiola's team much-needed defensive reinforcement after an injury-hit season. (AFP)

<img alt="Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella scored the second goal for Enzo Maresca's side. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788418_1_20250121070942.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea overcame a howler from goalkeeper Robert Sánchez to beat relegation-threatened Wolves 3-1, ending a five-game winless run to climb back into the Premier League's top four.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's team were just two points behind leaders Liverpool in mid-December, raising hopes of an unlikely title challenge before losing their way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now they are back on track to qualify for next season's Champions League after second-half goals from Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke spared Sánchez's blushes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish goalkeeper had dropped the ball moments before half-time, allowing Matt Doherty to cancel out Tosin Adarabioyo's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca said Chelsea had dominated the first 40 minutes before problems that have haunted them in recent weeks returned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We lost a little bit of confidence, we conceded a goal and we started to struggle a little bit and then the second half I think we started quite well and then after the second and third goals the game was in control," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past five games we didn't win but I said many times that the performance was there," he added. "We created many chances, we didn't score and tonight finally we scored three goals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's top-scorer Cole Palmer, a doubt before the game, was fit to start as Maresca made five changes from last week's draw against Bournemouth including bringing in centre-back Trevoh Chalobah, recalled from his loan spell at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side dominated possession in the early stages and Palmer had a couple of early efforts, curling one wide and forcing José Sá into a diving save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were rewarded for their dominance midway through the first half when Adarabioyo fired home for his first Premier League goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defender controlled the ball well after it was deflected into his path from Reece James's shot from the edge of the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of Chelsea players were in offside positions in a crowded penalty area and the flag was raised but the on-field decision was overturned after a VAR check. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump vowed a new "golden age" as he took the oath for a historic second US presidential term on Monday, painting a picture of an America in decline that only his hardline policies can restore to glory.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an address in the US Capitol, the 47th president promised a blitz of orders including the declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border and a policy of only recognizing two genders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also struck a nationalistic tone as he capped the most extraordinary comeback in US political history, pledging to impose trade tariffs, rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and take "back" the Panama Canal, which has been controlled by the Central American country since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world," Trump said in the Capitol, where the inauguration was held indoors for the first time in decades, due to freezing weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican even appeared to suggest he was on a divine mission, saying "I was saved by God to make America great again" after escaping an assassin's bullet at an election rally in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  While promising renewal, Trump denounced what he said had been a "betrayal" of Americans by a "radical and corrupt establishment" under outgoing President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America's decline is over," said Trump, who at 78 is now the oldest president ever to take office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 82, who had earlier hosted Trump and his wife Melania at the White House for tea, watched on as his political rival read the last rites over his single term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's last acts in office included preemptive pardons of former officials and his own siblings to shield them from Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump and said on Monday he was open to talks on the Ukraine conflict. (AFP)

 Police on Monday said a worker died after falling from a ladder in Happy Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the 58-year-old man was on a wooden ladder while he was installing an air-conditioner at a residence on Wilson Road in Jardine’s Lookout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker fell from around 1.5 metres at 10.30 am, injuring his head and passing out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sent to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai, where he was later certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it is very concerned about the fatal accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both police and the Labour Department are investigating the cause of the fall.

    Donald Trump sworn in as 47th US president

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was sworn in for a historic second term as US president on Monday, pledging a blitz of immediate orders on immigration and the US culture wars as he caps his extraordinary comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With one hand raised in the air, the 47th US president solemnly took the oath of office beneath the huge Rotunda of the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump and outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden had earlier travelled by motorcade together to the Capitol, where the ceremony was being held indoors - and with a much smaller crowd - for the first time in decades due to frigid weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, they and their spouses met for a traditional tea at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome home," Biden said to Trump as he and First Lady Jill Biden greeted their successors at the front door to the presidential residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, was a political outsider at his first inauguration in 2017 as the 45th president, but this time around he is surrounded by America's wealthy and powerful.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all had prime seats in the Capitol alongside Trump's family and cabinet members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who bankrolled Trump's election campaign to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars and promotes far-right policies on the X social network, will lead a cost-cutting drive in the new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump refused to attend Biden's 2021 inauguration after falsely claiming electoral fraud by the Democrat, this time Biden has been keen to restore the sense of tradition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden joined former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the Capitol. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush were there but ex-first lady Michelle Obama pointedly stayed away. (AFP)

 The Security Bureau said another Hong Kong resident suspected of being lured to Southeast Asia to engage in illegal work has been rescued.

    New system to simplify land ownership transfer mooted

<img alt="The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788360_1_20250120191656.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027 to help streamline procedures relating to ownership transfer.
 <br>
  <br>
  It will also cover land granted by private treaty and by land exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Monday, Development Bureau officials said it's estimated that there will be around 450 new land grants, and 25,000 title registers will be created within five years after the new system is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the current deeds registration system, title is decided by checking previous deeds, and officials said there is no guarantee of title to property.
  <br>
  <br>
  When conveyancing a property, the buyer’s lawyer has to check all previous title deeds carefully, including historical title documents, to make sure the property has a “clean title” so the buyer will have the legal ownership. Owners will also have to properly keep the title deeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, officials said title registration will provide certainty in property ownership, and the person who is being registered will be recognised as the true owner.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Title Register is conclusive evidence of title to the property,” an official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau also said the new system can shorten the property-transfer process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no need to check historical title documents in sale and purchase of property. People will find out the owner from the Title Register on the Land Registry, and whether there are other ownership interests,” the official added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A genuine and innocent buyer who has acquired the property will have the “indefeasible title”, even if the transfer of property involved third-party fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, the former owner can apply for compensation, capped at HK$50 million, under a Land Title Indemnity Fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that it does not have a timetable on converting the existing 2.9 million land registers to title registration, due to complicated legal issues such as problematic ownership.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairman of the Bar Association, Victor Dawes, said on Monday that while protecting national security is fundamentally important and helps to ensure Hong Kong's economic development, the authorities need to exercise their powers in a proportionate manner.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech at a ceremony marking the start of the Legal Year, Dawes said common law and the judicial system are pivotal to the success of Hong Kong and the constitutional order in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited Lord Hodge, deputy president of the United Kingdom's top court, as saying that the quality of a place's legal institutions is important to investment levels, innovation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawes said there is no doubt that protecting national security is fundamentally important and essential for economic prosperity and people's well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there continued to be unfair criticism overseas regarding security matters linked to incidents that took place in Hong Kong in 2019, and some of the criticism was aimed at undermining the SAR's prosperity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association chief said it's important for the authorities to exercise powers derived from national security laws in a considered and proportionate manner, to show that Hong Kong, as a jurisdiction, respects the rights of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ministers and public officers at all levels must be able to show that their powers are exercised in good faith, fairly, and for the purpose for which the powers are conferred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses must have the confidence that they will be dealt with on a principled and not an arbitrary basis. In this regard, powers under our new national security legislation should be used in a considered and proportionate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, said his organisation will do its best to preserve the legal sector's self-regulatory regime, saying this is seen as an important part of the profession's independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The independence of the profession will give the public confidence that it can take an objective view and effectively uphold the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is particularly important when our systems are under close scrutiny in the geopolitical climate, and the Law Society will strive to preserve the profession's self-regulatory status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong also called on the sector to play a bigger educational role to help tackle misinformation.

    Paul Lam slams 'efforts to exert pressure' on judges

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday hit out at attempts to "exert improper pressure" on overseas judges serving on Hong Kong's top court.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the beginning of the Legal Year, he also said people should not overlook the fact that some foreign non-permanent judges (NPJs) have decided to stay on the bench at the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the court. There are now 10 NPJs, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the "participation of eminent foreign judges" in the work of the top court benefits both the SAR and the common law world as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's most regrettable that there were attempts mainly from overseas to exert improper pressures on foreign judges to dissociate themselves from the Hong Kong court. These attempts pose a threat to not only the rule of law in Hong Kong but also the development of common law in general," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is in full support of the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign NPJs in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also criticised individuals who "intimidate" national security judges or "interfere" with judicial proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's vital to bear in mind that the enforcement of the national security law is subject to the supervision of the Hong Kong court exercising its independent judicial power," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anyone who intimidates judges handling national security cases or interferes with the relevant judicial proceedings in whatsoever manner cannot be genuinely concerned about the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the homegrown national security law, which took effect in March last year, aims to ensure "the hard-won peace and stability" that Hong Kong enjoys can be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless security is first safeguarded, it will be impossible for Hong Kong to utilise its unique strengths at full strength under the principle of One Country, Two Systems, and serve as an international financial, shipping and trade centre," Lam said.

    Rapist and murderer of Indian doctor jailed for life

<img alt="Police stand guard at an entrance of Civil and Criminal Court during the verdict for the case of the rape and murder of an Indian doctor in Kolkata. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788348_1_20250120180810.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The rapist and murderer of an Indian doctor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and widespread hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her weeping family had called for the convicted killer to be hanged and said they were "shocked" at the sentence, for a case that highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not "the rarest of the rare cases", and ordered that Sanjoy Roy must spend his life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August 2024 sparked outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The murder led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court last year ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of Roy, who pleaded not guilty and repeatedly insisted on his innocence was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim's mother, who was seated close to Roy when he was convicted on Saturday, has said the family wanted him to be hanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are shocked by the verdict", the victim's father told AFP, tears running down his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our fight, and won't let investigations stop... Come what may, we will fight for justice." (AFP)

    Legal principles upheld in all cases: chief justice

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's judges have upheld fundamental legal principles in hearing all cases, including national security trials, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the start of the Legal Year, the SAR's top judge said the city's national security laws have brought with them "cases that attract heightened attention", particularly due to their political sensitivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung stressed the same legal principles apply in national security cases as in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presumption of innocence, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the right to a fair trial are all essential safeguards that remain firmly in place," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our courts do not merely pay lip service to these fundamental principles. Judges at all levels are expected to, and indeed do, adhere to them in the adjudication of cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said tensions often exist between protecting basic rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the judiciary is firmly committed to upholding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Striking the right balance can be challenging, and outcomes in individual cases may be contentious at times, nor is the interpretation or application of newly enacted statutory provisions always straightforward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, it is one thing to disagree with a legal provision or a court decision in applying it, but entirely another to suggest that the justice system has been undermined by political expectations or societal atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after the ceremony, Cheung said the city's judges faced threats, and stressed that judicial officers should not be interfered with by any countries, bodies or organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Threatening sanctions against judges simply doing their work goes directly to the question of judicial independence and interfering with judges' work and therefore it is objectionable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is objectionable as a matter of principle and it is a direct affront to the rule of law and to judicial independence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief justice also said while the departure of foreign judges from the city's top court "caused concerns in some quarters", it has not affected judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunate that a few of these judges have felt unable to continue their service. They are, of course, entitled to their views, and their decisions ought to be respected. However, their premature departures do not mean a weakening of the quality or independence of the judiciary," Cheung said in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is true that, given the current geopolitical headwinds, recruiting overseas judges with the right stature and experience may be less straightforward than it once was. After all, overseas judges are appointed to our highest court on account of their acknowledged eminence and legal expertise, not merely to sustain the system of overseas judges for its own sake."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Following their exits, there are 10 non-permanent judges (NPJs) left sitting on the top court, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments made to the media, Cheung expressed confidence that the city will be able to recruit more overseas judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the rather stable number of appeals heard by the CFA in recent years, the number of 10 NPJs – six overseas NPJs, plus four local NPJs – plus possible appointment of further NPJs in the future, would be more than sufficient to allow us to cope with our very steady workload on the court," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm reasonably confident of keeping our existing NPJs as well as recruiting new NPJs in the future when we can identify suitable candidates to be appointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The top judge also said the presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of Hong Kong's judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the city has faced significant political, social and economic challenges in recent years, which tested the resilience of the territory's legal system and the strengths of its institutions. Despite that, he said, the judiciary continued to uphold the rule of law and ensured that legal procedures remain transparent, fair and independent.

    'Digital signage users need to up cyber security'

<img alt="HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases. Photo courtesy of HKCERT" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788324_2_20250120210646.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) on Monday urged organisations using digital signage devices to enhance security measures and review best practices to protect against potential cyber attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, the spokesman for HKCERT, said the use of digital signboards has increased significantly to engage customer interactions through digital advertising and public information, but warns that its growth comes with potential cyber risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT conducted a survey of 624 organisations across various industries, including retail, tourism and financial services and found that almost 40 percent of the companies they surveyed did not conduct risk assessments for their signages in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre identified various vulnerabilities that require urgent remediation among digital signage usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Someone uses a USB device that includes malicious content or also can
  <br>
  include some script, when they insert it into a digital signage with the USB port exposed, they can quickly replace the content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the infrared, it's another channel apart from the USB port the attacker can leverage, they can based on some infrared advice to emit some orders or instructions to the digital signage so that they would also, under the other malicious command, change the content of the digital signage."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some digital signage systems also utilise weak encryption methods, which could potentially allow to hackers intercept, control or obtain network information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said companies need to increase their awareness and conduct the security measures recommended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Physically, they block the USB port, they stop the USB port autoplay functions, the infrared services, or maybe use a very strong username password for the content management system, or use a stronger encryption protocol so that it's not easy to eavesdrop on the content sent between the user computer, the Wi-Fi network, the content management system, and the digital signage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases, marking a 108 percent increase from the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan highlighted that looking ahead this year, supply chain security and AI content hijacking will become the primary cyber security risks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Organisations and individuals must prepare by implementing appropriate cyber incident response measures, deploying suitable cyber security measures, conducting regular security audits and penetration testing, and understanding and preventing relevant risks," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained stable in the final three months of last year at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the previous figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate was also unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total employment increased by about 7,100 to 3,718,900, while the labour force barely changed at 3,831,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of unemployed people fell by around 6,100 to 113,600, while the number of underemployed individuals dropped by about 1,800 to 43,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the overall jobless rate remained low and there were improvements in the manufacturing, financing, social work, arts, entertainment and recreation sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though the employment situation in some sectors might be more affected by the increased uncertainties in the global environment," he added.

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high, trading above US$109,000 on Monday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788326_1_20250120170729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin hit a record high above US$109,000 on Monday as Donald Trump, who has signalled plans to deregulate the cryptocurrency sector, prepares to be sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin surged to reach an all-time peak of US$109,241 ahead of Trump's inauguration ceremony, before falling back to US$107,765.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared since Trump won the presidential election in November, with bitcoin surpassing US$100,000 for the first time in early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after he nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the new president will deregulate the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having once branded cryptocurrencies a "scam", Trump changed his stance and was a major advocate of them during his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, he launched his own cryptocurrency, appropriately called $TRUMP, sparking feverish buying that sent its market capitalisation soaring to several billion dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  When bitcoin reached the landmark US$100,000 level, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! US$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"
  <br>

  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was pitched as a way to break free of mainstream financial institutions by establishing a decentralised platform for transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency is created -- or "mined" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on a meddle-proof register known as the blockchain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has long been criticised for being the currency of choice for making untraceable payments on the so-called dark web, a hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The asset has often come under attack for facilitating money laundering and allowing extortion through ransomware attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its carbon footprint has also come under scrutiny because mining cryptocurrencies requires huge amounts of energy. (AFP)
