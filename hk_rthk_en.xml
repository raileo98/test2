<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

 The Hong Kong Observatory says it will issue a T1 between 6am and 9am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moves towards the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight tonight, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, windy conditions are likely by Tuesday, the observatory said, warning that some low-lying areas may see flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

    Electricians, plumbers on new workers priority list

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

    Thousands join 10km races on airport's third runway

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

 Host nation Peru has hailed the 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week a success as the event wrapped up on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long summit, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues over the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included Peru's signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with its biggest trading partner, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities: trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to the formal and global economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  She didn't divulge whether a Leaders’ Declaration had been adopted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 15-minute press conference ended without a chance for reporters to ask questions.

 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fly-half Thomas Ramos kicked 15 points to help France beat New Zealand 30-29 in a thrilling Test clash in Paris on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romain Buros, Paul Boudehent and Louis Bielle-Biarrey were the hosts' try-scorers as they claimed a third-straight win over the All Blacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lakai and Cam Roigard crossed for New Zealand before Damian McKenzie's contributions with the boot set-up a nervy last half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  France head coach Fabien Galthie recalled experienced centre Gael Fickou to the starting lineup in one of four changes from last Saturday's easy win over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand boss Scott Robertson welcomed back fly-half Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor after the influential pair missed last week's win over Ireland with injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the game New Zealand captain Scott Barrett said his side lost the scrum battle with the French in their World Cup defeat 13 months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the set-piece proved crucial in the opening score as the visitors were penalised and Les Bleus led 3-0 after seven minutes thanks to a Ramos shot at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robertson's outfit reacted almost immediately to make it 7-3 as Lakai, a second-minute replacement, crashed over for his maiden Test try and Beauden Barrett slotted the extras after nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks had the upper hand after the opening quarter, profiting from a poor France lineout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their dominance paid off even further after half an hour as scrum-half Roigard celebrated his 24th birthday by intercepting a pass destined for opposite number Antoine Dupont after a scrum to stroll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  With seven minutes of the first-half to play, France cut the score to 14-10 as full-back Buros crossed on his Test debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the interval, New Zealand led 17-10 as Beauden Barrett added a penalty to his earlier two conversions with the visitors in control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, the tight one-pass play paid off for the hosts as they trundled up the field before flanker Boudehent found a way over from a rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos kicked the conversion to bring the sides level at 17-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie had picked an extra forward on the bench by dropping fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the matchday squad and after 47 minutes brought on four of them at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, it bore fruit, as France led for the first time in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winger Bielle-Biarrey dotted down after a Ramos grubber kick and with the Toulouse playmaker's extras they were 24-17 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the try, the game was far from over and with 17 minutes to go McKenzie kicked two penalties either side of a Ramos effort to make it 27-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKenzie added a third penalty for 27-26 with 13 minutes to go and a tense final 10 minutes was set-up as Ramos and McKenzie once again traded shots at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks were camped in their own territory but their attack was held up and referee Nika Amashukeli blew the full-time whistle to send the majority of the 80,000-capacity crowd delirious. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday vowed to work with the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged," following the election, Xi said, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Xi that the two leaders haven't always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said the two countries' relationship would make "considerable progress" when both nations "treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, according to a simultaneous translation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come two months before Trump assumes office. (Reuters)

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain. (AFP)

 The guitar described by Noel Gallagher as "the best in the world," which he played on the third Oasis album "Be Here Now," sold at auction on Saturday for £226,800 (US$286,000).
 <br>
  <br>
  The custom Silver Sparkle Gibson Les Paul Florentine guitar that starred on the 1997 album was one of Gallagher's primary guitars during the height of Oasis's fame.

  <br>
  It was made for him at Gibson's custom shop and appeared in performances on The David Letterman Show and Saturday Night Live.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not one of the best guitars. It's the best guitar," Gallagher said of the instrument in a 1997 interview with Spin magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guitar was sold in a sale of entertainment memorabilia by online auction group Propstore. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Militants stormed a paramilitary checkpoint in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing seven troops, the latest in a string of attacks by separatist insurgents, police said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The early-morning attack in the mountainous Kalat district, some 150 km south of Quetta, capital of the southwestern Balochistan province, continued for several hours, said police officer Habib-ur-Rehman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 18 wounded paramilitary soldiers, some in critical condition, were admitted to local hospitals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its fighters had attacked the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has stepped up its operations recently, claiming a suicide bombing last week that targeted Pakistani army troops at a railway station minutes before they were due to board a train to return home for vacations. It killed 27, including 19 soldiers, who were in civilian clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA and several other militant groups have been fighting for decades for a separate homeland to gain a greater share of the mineral and resource-rich Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. (Reuters)

 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means."
 <br>
  <br>
  He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas. (AFP)

    Trump pick Hegseth accused of 2017 sexual assault

<img alt="Donald Trump's choice for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, was not charged over the allegation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779487_1_20241116182956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks just became even more so: Pete Hegseth, tapped for defence secretary earlier this week, was accused of sexual assault in 2017, according to police.
 <br>
  <br>
  No charges were filed in the case, but shocked Trump transition team officials are nonetheless reportedly weighing the next steps for the Fox News host, whose nomination took many in Washington by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Trump nominated the 44-year-old National Guard veteran on Tuesday to run the world's most powerful military, despite having never managed a large organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in Monterey, California confirmed on Thursday that they had investigated "an alleged sexual assault" at a hotel involving Hegseth that included bruising to the victim's right thigh, in early October 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the woman's accusations caught the Trump team off guard, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told the publication that the allegation "was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth "has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defence so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's hearing in the Senate is likely to be among the more fraught, not only due to his lack of experience but also other controversies, such as his lobbying of Trump during his first term to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts "Fox and Friends Weekend" and serves as a host for "Fox Nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He additionally served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations against Hegseth come as Trump's pick for attorney general, far-right former congressman Matt Gaetz, stunned many following his lengthy embroilment in sexual misconduct allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump himself was convicted of financial wrongdoing for covering up payments to a former porn star and found liable for defaming and sexually abusing an author.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has been married three times, divorcing his first wife in 2009 following an "irretrievable breakdown" and "infidelity," according to the Washington Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second wife filed for divorce in September 2017, one month after he had a baby with a Fox News producer whom he subsequently married, according to US media. (AFP)

    Kai Tak hosts rugby match as dummy run for new venue

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

    UN climate chief urges G20 to push for COP29 deal

<img alt="Simon Stiell says the G20's role in progress on climate action finance is mission-critical. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779484_1_20241116180132.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN's climate chief urged G20 nations on Saturday to push COP29 negotiations towards a deal to raise money for developing nations, warning there was a "long way to go."
 <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators worked through the night to narrow their differences at the UN talks in Baku before ministers arrive next week for the final days of the summit, but major differences remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell appealed for leaders of the Group of 20 nations, which includes the world's biggest economies and top polluters, to weigh in when they meet in Brazil on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As G20 Leaders head to Rio de Janeiro, the world is watching and expecting strong signals that climate action is core business for the world's biggest economies," Stiell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some developing countries, which are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, want an annual commitment of US$1.3 trillion to help them adapt to climate impact and transition to clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is over 10 times what donors including the United States, the European Union and Japan currently pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the negotiations are stuck over a final figure, the type of financing and who should pay, with developed countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft deal was 25 pages long, and still contained a raft of options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here in Baku negotiators are working around the clock on a new climate finance goal," Stiell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a long way to go, but everyone is very aware of the stakes, at the halfway point in the COP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate finance progress outside of our process is equally crucial, and the G20's role is mission-critical." (AFP)

    Philippines braces for impact of Super Typhoon Man-yi

<img alt="Man-yi will be the sixth major storm to batter the Philippines in the past month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779477_1_20241116162508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A super typhoon sweeping towards the Philippines on Saturday was intensifying and could have a "potentially catastrophic" impact, the state weather forecaster warned, with millions of people at risk from storm surges.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 650,000 people have fled their homes ahead of Super Typhoon Man-yi, which is expected to make landfall later on Saturday or early on Sunday, becoming the sixth major storm to pummel the archipelago nation in the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  With wind gusts of up to 240 kilometres per hour, Man-yi was on track to slam into the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon or "near peak intensity", the weather service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said in its latest update, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 14-metre high seas were expected around Catanduanes, while more than 7.6 million people were at risk from storm surges of one to three metres, the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we would be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea was sheltering with her fruit vendor husband and their three children in a school classroom with nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions were hot and cramped – the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan – but Perea said it was better to be safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials – just two gusts are required to knock it down," said Perea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why we evacuated. Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation centres were filling up on Catanduanes island in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, with the weather forecaster warning of "widespread incidents of severe flooding and landslides."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 400 people were squeezed into the provincial government building in the capital Virac, with new arrivals being sent to a gymnasium, said provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monterola said he had dispatched soldiers to force about 100 households in two coastal villages near Virac to move inland due to fears storm surges could swamp their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the exact landfall point, heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surges may occur in areas outside the predicted landfall zone," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the mediaeval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano said, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  All vessels – from fishing boats to oil tankers – have been ordered to stay in port or return to shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 people were stranded after the coast guard shut 55 ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi will hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anthony Davis scored 40 points and LeBron James made more history to spark the Los Angeles Lakers over San Antonio 120-115 on Friday, launching their bid to defend the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  James managed a triple-double in a fourth consecutive game for the first time in his 22 NBA seasons, the 39-year-old legend delivering 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists over a game-high 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the game and I'm happy I'm still able to come out here and make some plays to help our ball club win," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  James tied a Lakers triple-double record streak and became the oldest player in NBA history with four triple-doubles in a row, all in winning efforts, although his seven turnovers stung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just putting the work in. My teammates trust me with the ball," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess they trusted me a little too much tonight with the seven turnovers. I've got to be a lot better than that if I'm going to have the ball in my hands. I'll clean that up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, won a battle of the big men with last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, Frenchman Victor Wembanyama, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Spurs in the West Group B clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another magnificent game by AD," James said. "We lean on AD every night. The ball goes to him not only the first option but also the second option... He has definitely been a beast this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Stephon Castle's basket gave the Spurs a 115-114 lead, Davis made a slam dunk with 91 seconds to play and James sank a layup, his first basket in more than 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Castle missed a tying 3-point attempt and James made two free throws to seal San Antonio's fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis drove to the hoop and banged his right knee into the left knee of Wembanyama late in the game but both were playing at the finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, downing Chicago 144-126 as games were played in all six NBA Cup groups with results also counting in the NBA regular-season standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland improved to 14-0 as Donovan Mitchell scored 37 points to lead the East Group C rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just so much fun. The vibes are right," Cleveland's Jarrett Allen said. "It just seems like everything is clicking right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers are only the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0, matching the fourth-best start in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group A, Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox scored 60 points but the host Kings lost to Minnesota 130-126 in overtime as Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, James Harden matched Ray Allen for second behind Stephen Curry on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list on 2,973, scoring 21 points for the Los Angeles Clippers in a 125-104 loss at Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabari Smith led the Rockets with 28 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 28 points to lead Oklahoma City over visiting Phoenix 99-83, keeping the Thunder in the Western Conference lead at 11-2 in the Group B game.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group C, Brandon Ingram had 29 points as host New Orleans snapped a six-game losing skid by beating Denver 101-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the league's rebounds and assists leader, was out for personal reasons as Denver's five-game win streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, Golden State reserve Buddy Hield had 18 points and 12 Warriors scored in a 123-118 home victory over Memphis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group C, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels led eight double-figure scorers with 25 points as the Hawks beat visiting Washington 129-117.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire at the neonatal unit of an Indian hospital killed 10 newborns, authorities said on Saturday, with another 16 clinging to life after a blaze blamed on a faulty oxygen machine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Building fires are common in India due to shoddy construction and a routine disregard for safety regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday night's fire broke out at about 10:30 pm (1700 GMT) at the Maharani Lakshmibai Medical College in Jhansi, around 450 kilometres south of the capital New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage from the scene showed charred beds and walls inside the ward as a crowd of anguished families waited outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Babies rescued from the fire, all only days old, were laid side by side on a bed elsewhere in the hospital as staff hooked up their arms to intravenous drips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten infants have sadly died," Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven bodies have been identified. Three bodies haven't been identified as yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 16 infants were in critical condition after the blaze, news outlet Times Now reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pathak said a safety audit of the hospital was carried out in February followed by a fire drill three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the fire will be probed," he added. "If any lapses are found, strict action will be taken against those responsible and no one will be spared."
  <br>
  <br>
  District official Avinash Kumar said the fire had been caused by an electrical short circuit in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing medical care to the critically injured," he was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports quoted other officials who said the fire started in a piece of machinery used to enrich the level of oxygen in the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high concentration of the combustible gas in the unit helped the fire spread quickly and suddenly, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster NDTV reported that 54 infants in total were in the neonatal intensive care unit when the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the deaths "heart-wrenching" in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My deepest condolences to those who have lost their innocent children in this. I pray to God to give them the strength to bear this immense loss," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced compensation of 500,000 rupees (US$5,900) to bereaved families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The district administration and concerned officials have been instructed to carry out relief and rescue operations on a war footing," Adityanath wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray to Lord Shri Ram to provide salvation to the departed souls and speedy recovery to the injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's fire comes six months after a similar blaze at a children's hospital in New Delhi that killed six newborns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee had his most hectic day yet in his week-long visit of Peru, signing a free trade agreement with the nation and meeting with the leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also attended an informal dialogue on Friday, Lima time, briefing regional leaders on the SAR’s strengths as well as its role in China’s Belt and Road initiative and Apec development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong leader then met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for the first time since July last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked Anwar for supporting the SAR’s plan to establish an Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, the fourth in the region known as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also congratulated Malaysia for taking the chairmanship of Asean next year, and hoped the nation will continue to support Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or Rcep.
  <br>
  <br>
  After attending another Apec dialogue where he exchanged views Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Lee had two more bilateral meeting with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries are key trading partners of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader’s day culminated in the signing of the FTA between Hong Kong and Peru, and he got to relax by watching cultural performances at an Apec gala dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Lima time, Lee will attend the Apec Economic Leaders' meeting retreat and meet with Peruvian business sector representatives.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson's controversial return to boxing ended in a one-sided defeat on Friday, with Youtuber-turned-prizefighter Jake Paul cruising to victory by a unanimous decision against the heavyweight icon in Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, 58, barely landed a punch during the eight-round bout at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, with Paul winning by big margins on all three cards – 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, 27, used his superior speed and movement to dominate the ageing Tyson with ease, and had the former undisputed heavyweight champion in trouble after landing a flurry of punches in the third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the younger fighter was unable to land the knockout blow he had promised to deliver during Thursday's ill-tempered weigh-in, where Tyson slapped him across the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, however, looked every bit of his 58 years, managing to land only a handful of meaningful punches during the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final statistics showed Tyson connected with just 18 of 97 punches thrown while Paul threw some 278 punches and landed 78 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the final seconds of the eighth round counted down, Paul could even afford to bow in respect to Tyson before the bell sounded. (AFP)

<img alt='President Xi Jinping has told his Japanese counterpart, Shigeru Ishiba, Beijing is ready to work with Tokyo  "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

    '20 used fake DSE certs to apply for Macau university'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Saturday said the authorities have stepped up screening after 20 people used forged DSE certificates to apply for the Macau University of Science and Technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, she said the university suspected that the documents were bogus and had contacted the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous. There were 20 fake DSE certificates. For anyone who has doubts about the DSE results, we can help. The HKEAA keeps a record of the DSE results and can help verify them," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the authorities have reported the cases to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added that some people had used fake academic qualifications to gain admission to universities in Hong Kong, but she said applications are now being checked more closely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, she said a task group on setting up the SAR's third medical school will hold its second meeting later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the expected requirements, the universities which are interested can make changes to their proposals and examine their own qualifications... So this is not a race to see who hands in their proposals fastest," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said on Saturday that he's confident that the shipping industry will prefer Hong Kong's bunkering facilities to those of nearby cities.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking a day after the authorities unveiled plans to develop the SAR into a high-quality green maritime fuel bunkering centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, including an aim to switch 55 percent of diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said the demand for green maritime fuel will gradually increase in line with the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and he expects Hong Kong to outperform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of traditional fuels, Hong Kong ranked seventh among global fuel bunkering ports. The other two in the GBA were not within the top ten, so we have an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green maritime fuel bunkering is like adding a new type of fuel to a gas station, and green maritime fuel will be more widely used as vessels have to reduce their carbon footprint... This will boost business at our port."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the government will look into using 11 hectares of land in Tsing Yi to store green methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met Hong Kong government officials together with SAR representatives of the business sector in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Xia had urged Hong Kong to develop its ports in land, air and sea, and the authorities would consider tax reduction measures to attract more maritime service enterprises to expand their business in the city, strengthening the SAR's status as an international maritime hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

 The free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will put the SAR in the global spotlight and fast-track regional trade, according to the city’s delegate to a key working group of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exporters and shippers also welcomed the pact and expressed interest in expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, citing the city’s strategic location in Asia and connections with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marjorie Yang, a Hong Kong, China, representative on the Apec Business Advisory Council, said one of the biggest features of a free-trade agreement is lowering, or abolishing, tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that wasn’t the case here.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Right now, this trade agreement eliminates tariffs on the Peruvian side, but Hong Kong doesn't have any tariffs to eliminate. So Peruvian business have always been welcome to come and do business in Hong Kong,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, who's also the head of Esquel Group, one of the world's biggest textile and apparel manufacturers, explained what the Hong Kong-Peruvian FTA is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Bilateral agreements are always good because if you can't get (something) like CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) going, you can get bilateral agreements and gradually push.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “So this agreement … the terms are such that if there are better terms reached in other bilaterals, we would also benefit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Vasquez, a former minister of foreign trade and tourism in Peru, stressed that free trade deals have many facets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The main focus of the free trade agreement is to have the possibility to cooperate with each other in many other aspects with regards to goods, because we have sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, intellectual property,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now representing the Peruvian Association of Exporters, Vasquez believes the agreement boosts exposure of Hong Kong in Peru and vice versa.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure that with the free trade agreement, as with our experience with the United States, our exports exploded. With China also, our exports increased a lot. We signed with Thailand, with Australia, our exports are growing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For Liverita, a Peruvian freight forwarder and consultancy firm, Hong Kong was already on its radar years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  It set up an office in the SAR in 2020 and followed up with another outlet in Shanghai later that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  General manager Carolina Hurtado said she was extremely grateful for the assistance from InvestHK, the SAR government arm tasked to lure direct foreign Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[That’s] because you really don't have an idea of how many ports or how many locals or chamber of commerce I have visited and asked for information. I mean, what do I need? What info, what documents, what is the process, how much I need to invest?” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are pretty (good) friends right now with them (InvestHK).”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurtado added that Hong Kong’s advanced infrastructure and robust financial sector makes it an ideal destination for investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I know that the financial companies in Hong Kong are pretty big, more than 100 banks, right? In Peru we don't have more than 20. They don't have a lot of bank investors or bank information for international products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I know Hong Kong (has) got that.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland rebounded from defeat to New Zealand by edging Argentina 22-19 in a nailbiting one-off rugby union Test at Lansdowne Road on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish led by 13 points at the break but a lack of discipline and excellent play by the Pumas almost gave the visitors their first ever win in Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went right down to the wire there," Ireland skipper Caelen Doris told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were happy with how it started. There was a good feeling through the warm-up and that carried over to the start. I felt we were in a pretty good position at half time and their quality showed in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ireland started brightly but it was the Pumas who thought they had struck first through Matias Moroni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead Moroni trudged off after receiving a yellow card for a head collision with Irish fly-half Jack Crowley earlier in the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Crowley who was celebrating a minute later as he went over for his second Test try and converting it for 7-0 in the fourth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barely a minute had passed since Crowley's try when Garry Ringrose broke through the centre and a sublime pass by Jamison Gibson-Park found Tadhg Beirne, who selflessly passed inside to Mack Hansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-born wing touched down for his 10th Test try -- Crowley failed to convert but the Irish were 12-0 up inside six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz got his team on the board with a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish piled the pressure on the visitors and were denied a third try after Beirne knocked on as he went to touch the ball down.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they lost prop Finlay Bealham to a yellow card in the 17th minute for a dangerous tackle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Farrell looked rueful in the coach's box as Bealham trotted off with Albornoz knocking over the penalty for 12-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley landed a sweetly struck drop goal to make it 15-6 to the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz's unerring boot added three more points shortly before Bealham returned to the fray for 15-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas resisted waves of Irish attacks but finally cracked just after the half hour mark as Joe McCarthy powered over for his second Test try -- Crowley converted for 22-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Irish line somehow held out as the Pumas pressed in the final few minutes of the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ringrose turned the ball over and the hosts breathed easier as they headed in 22-9 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Pumas responded brilliantly after the break, fullback Juan Cruz Mallia broke through from deep, Ringrose and Hansen failing to bring him down, and touched down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz converted for 22-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish discipline was creaking just as it did against the All Blacks, conceding three penalties within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Paul Williams had had enough of Irish offsides and sent McCarthy to the sin bin much to Farrell's frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz moved past 100 points in Test rugby with a smoothly taken penalty for 22-19 and just under half an hour to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The penalty count went to 10 as Crowley took out Albornoz in the air, but at the end of the next phase of play the Pumas' fly-half sent a drop goal attempt wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farrell rang the changes just after the hour including replacing Crowley with 21-year-old Sam Prendergast for his first cap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night came in the 67th minute as prop Cian Healy came on to equal Brian O'Driscoll's Irish record of 133 caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish were hanging on but received a huge boost when Pumas replacement Francisco Gomez Kodela was sin-binned for a head shot on Doris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas were the ones pressing right at the end and were inside the 22 when the Irish managed to turn the ball over. (AFP)

    US, European markets fall on interest rate jitters

<img alt="US markets finished lower as traders pondered comments from the head of the US central bank signalling that it was in no hurry to cut interest rates. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779429_1_20241116075502.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global stock markets ended the week on a sour note on Friday as traders digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that the US central bank was not on a preset path to cut interest rates.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Powell indicated the Fed was in no hurry to cut rates as it monitors inflation's downward trajectory, Wall Street turned red, with all three major indices closing lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly Powell's speech has triggered some skepticism about the path of rates, with potentially December being a skip instead of another cut," Edward Jones senior investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we do have another inflation and jobs report before that, so there is still a good sense we might see another rate cut in December," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 percent to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent to 18,680.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading the way down were a clutch of vaccine-makers' stocks after US President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London was off 0.1 percent, digesting disappointing growth data. Frankfurt and Paris also ended in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disappointing US retail sales in October did not help overall sentiment as oil prices also drifted down.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech on Thursday, Powell said that "the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the US central bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, investors are scaling back their bets on how many cuts will be made next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are worried tax cuts and tariffs planned by Trump could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The (Trump) administration's renewed focus on tariffs could weigh heavily on currencies of trade-exposed economies, particularly those in Asia and the eurozone," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  European markets stuttered as the European Commission predicted economic growth would pick up slightly and inflation would keep falling in the eurozone next year, but warned of growing risks linked to geopolitical tensions. (AFP)

    HK-Peru FTA to boost more than 150 sectors

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has signed a free trade agreement with Peru, concluding two years of negotiations with the South American nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Chief Executive John Lee and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte looked on, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau and his Peruvian counterpart, Ursula Desliu Leon, inked the much-anticipated deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTA will take effect after both sides have completed their respective internal procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represents Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement, and the 21st economy that the SAR has struck a pact with.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the SAR government, over 150 services sectors will benefit from commitments made by Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some examples include professional, transport, financial, recreational and cultural services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier pledged to provide a transparent and favourable platform for Hong Kong investors wishing to set up shop in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America with bilateral trade reaching HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peruvian exports to Hong Kong accounted for only one third of that total, and producers here are keen to bump up shipments of popular products such as fruits and vegetables, as well as fish meal.

    Hamas official says 'ready' for Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Most of Gaza has been reduced to rubble over the past 13 months. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779374_1_20241115202323.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Hamas official said on Friday that the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza and urged US President-elect Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, said Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas informed the mediators that it is in favour of any proposal submitted to it that would lead to a definitive ceasefire and military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, allowing the return of displaced people, a serious deal for a prisoner exchange, the entry of humanitarian aid and reconstruction," Naim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands are the same ones Hamas has made in successive rounds of ceasefire negotiations since the start of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump promised peace in the Middle East and has vowed to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naim's comments come after Qatar said on Saturday that it had suspended its role as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gulf emirate, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with US blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war triggered by the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' over floods

<img alt="Carlos Mazon admits he was having lunch on the afternoon of the disaster. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779377_1_20241115203421.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted on Friday to "mistakes" in handling the country's deadliest floods in decades that killed 216 people there and apologised.
 <br>
  <br>
  The October 29 disaster claimed 224 lives nationwide. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to deny mistakes," Carlos Mazon told Valencia's regional parliament, adding he was "not going to shirk any responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  As the head of the regional government "I would like to apologise" to those who "felt" that "the aid did not arrive or was not enough," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the building, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation and calling him a liar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost half the people killed in Valencia were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several carried placards that read: "Our hands are stained with mud, theirs with blood."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system. In some cases, residents were only contacted by telephone when floodwater was already gushing through towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergency alert was only sent after 8 pm, nearly 13 hours after the state weather agency warned of the risk of "very intense" rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of Valencia's emergency department admitted she did not learn it was possible to send such warnings until the evening of the first day of the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Spain's decentralised system of government, regional governments lead disaster response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Socialist-led central government has said Mazon's administration, run by the conservative Popular Party (PP), bore responsibility for not issuing the alert earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mazon has also come under fire for having been missing for several critical hours on the afternoon of the disaster when it was already raining heavily.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to repeated questions for explanations for his absence, he finally admitted he had been having lunch with a journalist to offer her the directorship of the regional television station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have complained they were left without food and water for days and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oil executives and lobbyists descended on COP29 in Baku for "energy day" on Friday, as environmental groups denounced the presence of the fossil fuel industry at the UN climate talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  While negotiators haggled over the key goal of an increase in climate funding, a former UN chief denounced the talks as "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of France's TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said the sector is "part of the problem," but insisted it was making "continuous progress" on transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Kick the Big Polluters Out" (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the annual climate confab, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fossil fuel industry is creating havoc in people's lives, the fossil fuel industry is responsible for destruction," said Makoma Lekalakala, a South African environmental campaigner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presence of oil, gas and coal interests at the climate talks has long been a source of controversy, and the appointment of UAE state oil firm head Sultan Al Jaber to head last year's negotiations in Dubai stoked criticism.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's host is energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday repeated his insistence that oil and gas are a "gift of God."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US vice president and climate activist Al Gore warned on Thursday that "the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of leading climate activists and scientists including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday that the COP process was "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  They urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate change for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the talks remained crucial for vulnerable nations shut out of forums like the G20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the only time that our voice can be clearly heard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  KBPO said Japan brought employees of coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation, Canada included oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, some of those on the NGO list work for companies that are not primarily fossil fuel-related, including Danish offshore wind champion Orsted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority at the talks is a new figure for climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition their economies away from fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rich nations are reluctant to spend much more than the US$100 billion a year already committed, conscious of domestic publics angry about inflation and stuttering economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But developing countries warn they need at least US$1 trillion to defend against the ravages of climate change and meet commitments to reach net-zero emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators are struggling to agree on a workable draft text before ministers arrive next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must be honest, we believe that the pace of their work is currently too slow," warned COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanging over proceedings is the question of what role the United States will play on climate action and funding after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January, given his pledge to again withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  American officials at the talks have insisted Trump will struggle to undo the climate action already in motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When history is written, he will be looked at as a speed bump on the tremendous growth of this clean energy transition," the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, told an event on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab on Friday extended school closures in smog-hit major cities by a week, as the country battles record air pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The schools will remain closed for another week due to the hazardous air quality. Institutes including universities would switch to online classes to ensure the safety of students," Marriyum Aurangzeb, Punjab's environment minister, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air quality in Lahore was deemed "hazardous," according to data from IQAir, with the concentration of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – around 30 times the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 35,000 patients have been reported in the hospitals of Lahore due to smog-related health issues in almost a month," Aurangzeb added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also urged residents to "stop roaming around on bikes and in cars and to wear masks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The province, home to more than half of Pakistan's 240 million people, had previously closed all schools until November 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  A mix of low-grade fuel emissions from factories and vehicles, exacerbated by agricultural burning, blanket the city each winter, trapped by cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's food agency says transport is the main cause of air pollution in Pakistan, followed by industry and agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children are often hardest hit, with Unicef noting that "prior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12 percent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were due to air pollution." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A collection of guitars and other musical equipment owned by influential rock guitarist Jeff Beck will go on sale in London in January, Christie's auctioneers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the 130 guitars, amps and "tools of the trade" used by Beck during his decades-spanning career are expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) when they go under the hammer on January 22, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include the rock legend's 1954 "Oxblood" Gibson Les Paul, famously depicted on the cover of his seminal 1975 solo instrumental album "Blow By Blow" and used on several tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is estimated to fetch up to £500,000 (US$634,000).
  <br>
  <br>
  Beck, who rose to stardom with 1960s supergroup The Yardbirds and later enjoyed a prolific solo career, died in January last year aged 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Sandra Beck, said it was "a massive wrench" to part with the instruments but that they needed to be "shared, played and loved again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guitars were his great love and after almost two years of his passing, it's time to part with them as Jeff wished," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the future guitarists who acquire these items are able to move closer to the genius who played them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The collection includes another Gibson Les Paul from 1958, dubbed the original "Yardburst" as it was bought in 1966 while Beck was in the seminal British rock group. It is valued at up to £60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Fender Telecaster and Gibson hybrid crafted by world-renowned guitar designer Seymour Duncan specifically for Beck in 1973 is predicted to sell for as much as £150,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlights from the guitar haul will be on public view in Los Angeles on December 4-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full collection will go on show for a week at Christie's London headquarters before the January 22 sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie's Amelia Walker said the auctioneers were "honoured to have been entrusted" with the sale of instruments belonging to a "rock pioneer whose influence on his peers was unmatched."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added Beck's guitars had "shared his emotion and voice" with the world and the auction would "pay tribute to his enduring legacy." (AFP)

    Tyson takes a swipe at Paul ahead of anticipated fight

<img alt="58-year-old Mike Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779365_1_20241115190345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson could not wait to put on the gloves to take a shot at upcoming opponent Jake Paul, striking the social media influencer-turned-boxer in the face as they approached each other at Thursday's weigh-in at Arlington, Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-time "Baddest Man on the Planet," 58-year-old Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years against "ultimate heel" Paul in the wildly anticipated showdown at the AT&T Stadium on Friday (8 pm EST).
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no love lost between the two as Tyson, who weighed in at 228.4 pounds, approached Paul and immediately slapped the 27-year-old in the face and offered a two-word televised remark before walking off stage: "Talking's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, who gained a cult following on YouTube before turning to boxing four years ago, was far more loquacious, offering an expletive-riddled rant about his plans to demolish Tyson, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's angry, he's an angry little elf," said Paul, who weighed in at 227.2 pounds. "It's personal now – he must die!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight is the first live boxing match that Netflix has aired, as the streamer with more than 280 million subscribers makes inroads into the sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match has drawn extraordinary global interest but also criticism, with British promoter Eddie Hearn dismissing the bout as "dangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, said in an interview last month that the fight was not about the payday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not for financial reasons. My life is not going to change, not one percentage point after this fight. We will always be able to live this way," he said. "And I'm just doing it because I want to test myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, Paul will get US$40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August. Tyson will get US$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tyson's last professional fight was a loss against Kevin McBride in 2005. The fight against Paul will be shorter: eight two-minute rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12 three-minute rounds. Both boxers will also use heavier 14-ounce gloves instead of the typical 10-ounce gloves. (Reuters/AP)

    Landslide win for Sri Lanka president's coalition

<img alt="Anura Kumara Dissanayake's leftist coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779382_1_20241115211555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake thanked voters on Friday for delivering his leftist coalition a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections that repudiated establishment parties blamed for triggering an economic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, a self-avowed Marxist, swept September presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover stolen assets, two years after a slow-motion financial crash imposed widespread hardships on the island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to immediately call polls and secure parliamentary backing for his agenda was vindicated on Friday, with his National People's Power (NPP) coalition taking at least 159 seats in the 225-member assembly – exceeding a two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance," Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coalition had a monumental 61.5 percent of the vote while opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party was well behind with only 17.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system," said IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sign of the magnitude of support for Dissanayake, his party won the most votes in the northern district of Jaffna, dominated by the island's minority Tamil community, for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September's presidential polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, the 55-year-old son of a labourer, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stormed to the presidency after successfully distancing himself from successive leaders blamed for steering the country to its 2022 economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial crash was the worst in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka's history as an independent nation, sparking months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resulting public anger culminated in the storming of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's pledge to change a "corrupt" political culture has resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation's finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very happy about this victory," said voter Nilusha Nilmini after the scale of the win became clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All this time, the country was governed by thieves, robbers and corrupt people. I am very happy that the crooks are out and a clean government has been established."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's JVP party, the main constituent in the NPP coalition, led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987 that resulted in at least 80,000 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he was sworn in after presidential polls described as one of the island nation's most peaceful elections. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."

 Authorities on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from the cargo industry and expand the use of green maritime fuels among government fleets and ships registered in the city.

  The government wants to switch 55 percent of the diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026, and cut carbon emissions at the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals by 30 percent in 2030 compared with 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said Hong Kong is currently ranked seventh as a global bunkering hub, offering strategic advantages for international ships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the present moment, we do not have any forecast on the economic benefits. But one of the side benefits of attracting ships to use our bunkering services is that... there will be opportunities for them to use our cargo handling," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also opportunities for them to use the Hong Kong maritime services. So this would be added values for Hong Kong to ensure that we maintain [our role] as the international maritime centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about difficulties in transitioning to green fuels, Director of Marine Wong Sai-fat said existing engines are tailor-made for specific fuel types and can't easily switch to alternatives like LNG or methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By large, the government vessels are using the diesel engine and the petrol engine. For the use of the petrol engine, it's using the petroleum, and that is not easy or straightforward that you can use other alternative fuel to replace the petrol engine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong added that diesel engines are more adaptable and can mix with biofuel, which is already being used in several government vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said it will provide training to nurture talent in the field of green maritime fuel, with 50 people expected to be trained by 2026.

<img alt="Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of this year's US presidential election and endorsed Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779324_1_20241115153158.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the top health agency in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic diseases, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they needed to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump that he would work to "Make America Healthy Again”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump, in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country," Trump said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over public health agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among Kennedy's suggestions is that he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices – and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "FDA's war on public health is about to end," he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its "aggressive suppression" of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine and other items.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has been criticised for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  He disputes the anti-vaccine tag, saying he instead wants more rigorous testing of vaccines. However, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a non-profit organisation that focuses on anti-vaccine messaging. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday passed a motion of thanks for Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the third and final day of the discussion at Legco, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the need to transform the local economy as mentioned by the CE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said his sector – amid recent struggles – faces similar challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now there's a shift in the consumption pattern of these mainland visitors. E-commerce is all the rage these days, and local residents are glad to head north for dining and shopping," Shiu, who also chairs the Liberal Party, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I said, let's recognise the new situation, let's use technology so that our goods are sold not just locally... let's use the online platform and promote our products elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu also called on entrepreneurs to take a major part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, saying they should be confident about the country and the SAR and that the project would produce great returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee sector lawmaker Doreen Kong, for her part, noted that some tenants living in sub-divided units (SDUs) said rents are rising as the government plans to regulate these homes and turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  The official leading a task force on the matter, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, said the government has confidence tackling the issue now because there are more flats in the pipeline to accommodate SDU tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stick to this people-centric and orderly approach," Wong said in the chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can continue to boost the quantity and speed in building public housing, more SDU residents can move into public flats and demand for SDUs will gradually fall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials will give a report on the matter to the legislature at the start of next month, which will be followed by a two-month public consultation exercise.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government will issue retail infrastructure bond worth HK$20 billion next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-year bond will be linked to inflation and offer a minimum guaranteed interest of 3.5 percent, to be paid every six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's lower than the 4 percent for the latest round of silver bond offered by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, executive director for external affairs for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Kenneth Hui, said the interest for the retail infrastructure bond is still appealing to investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we set the interest rate, we do consider a combination of factors, including market conditions as well as the demand, as well as the interest rates of comparable products right now in the market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All things considered, we feel that 3.5 percent is an attractive rate, particularly considering the latest interest rate trend in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said each lot is worth HK$10,000, and each investor will be allocated a maximum of 100 lots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription period will last from November 26 to December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bond will be issued on December 17 and listed on the local bourse the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceeds will be used to finance infrastructure projects, including new towns and airport development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 34-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

 Runners and organisers of the Hong Kong Oxfam Trailwalker on Friday braced for a rainy start and a mischievous troop of monkeys.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video showed that dozens of monkeys were raiding a supply station set up along the route, ransacking for food and delving into a torn blue-and-white striped nylon bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, Oxfam Hong Kong’s director of fundraising and communications, said it is hard to prevent the animals from enjoying what he called a "once-a-year, all-you-can-eat buffet" at the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said volunteers could only replenish food and supplies at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oxfam Trailwalker is one of the city's largest fundraising events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Participants are given 48 hours to complete the 100-kilometre run, kicking off at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and finishing at Harrow International School Hong Kong in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also a shorter 40-kilometre race.

    'Some fan heaters not energy efficient'

<img alt="Gilly Wong, left, says the devices tested by the Consumer Council have different airflow rates and energy-efficiency levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council said on Friday bladeless fans with heating functions may not be as energy efficient as some other products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found 11 models it tested took longer to heat up the room than traditional fan heaters it tested previously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The models were also found to have different airflow rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average is 16.1 cubic metres per minute, three of them had an airflow rate of 10 cubic metres or less per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are talking about the airflow rate for different bladeless fans, we found it quite diverse. The energy efficiency, as well, is also quite diverse. Don't assume the fact that this kind of fans are very similar in terms of energy consumption. In actual fact, there are more energy-saving ones for you to select," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more you use energy-efficient appliances, the more you save for your expenses, but furthermore, you help to save the environment as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said by contrast, reverse-cycle air conditioners, which offers both heating and cooling in one system, may be more energy efficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said it's ultimately up to consumers to choose what they want to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are pros and cons. If you are talking about the reverse-cycle air conditioner, its heating capacity is much better and energy efficiency is much better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when you are talking about the installation, the cost by itself obviously is higher, and also the mobility of it is not there because it's fixed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department could consider including different types of electric fans in the Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, so consumers can compare products.

 Hong Kong authorities on Friday kicked off their first cybersecurity drill in a bid to enhance their defence capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event involves a number of government departments and public bodies handling cyberattacks carried out by some members of the IT industry.

  <br>
  Innovation and technology minister Sun Dong said cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the digital economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maintaining online security is an important part of promoting high-quality economic development and building smart cities. This long-term task is always ongoing, and never finished," Sun said in a speech marking the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sincerely hope that participating teams, as well as observing departments and organisations, will seize this opportunity to test yourself and improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that eight mainland cybersecurity firms with experience with such drills offered technical support and suggestions for this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drill was organised by the Digital Policy Office and co-hosted by various departments, such as the police cybersecurity and tech crimes unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not reveal which government systems are involved in the drill.

    Scent boosters 'unnecessary add-ons for laundry'

 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

    President Xi inaugurates new Peru megaport

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to cross the border at two checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It applies to mainland residents who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

    Sinner beats Medvedev for perfect ATP Finals group run

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

    Powell lauds US economy as 'remarkably good'

<img alt="US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says inflation is falling, the labour market is solid and growth is resilient. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779227_1_20241115061843.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The recent performance of the US economy has been "the best of any major economy in the world," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, a week after the bank cut interest rates for a second consecutive meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank recently started cutting back its key lending rates from a two-decade high, turning attention from tackling inflation to supporting the labor market as the rate of price increases has moderated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been widespread anger about the cumulative impact of years of inflation, which has pushed up consumer prices by more than 20 percent since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the economic facts today are clear, Powell said during an event in Dallas, Texas, noting that inflation was falling toward the Fed's long-term two percent target, the labor market was "solid," and economic growth remained resilient.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell noted that inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was "running much closer" to the bank's target, but had not reached it just yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting," he said, referring to the level of interest rates over the long run that keep both inflation and unemployment in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the path for getting there is not preset," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures traders currently place a probability of close to 60 percent that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)
