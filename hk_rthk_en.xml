<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Friday said it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the United States' decision to impose an additional 10 percent tariffs on Hong Kong products.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said the US measure was “grossly inconsistent” with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that Washington had ignored that the city is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law, and recognised by the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government will formally launch procedures in accordance with the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism against the US' unreasonable measures to defend our legitimate rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR supports the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government urged the US to rectify its measures immediately.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celcius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>

  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

<img alt="Israel has praised US sanctions on the International Criminal Court which issued an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu over his role in the Gaza war. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790687_1_20250207155955.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday called on its member states to stand up against sanctions imposed by US President Donald Trump, saying the move was an attempt to “harm its independent and impartial judicial work.”
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House issued the executive order on Thursday in response to what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was referring to the arrest warrant the ICC issued last year for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague-based court said it “condemns” the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Court stands firmly by its personnel and pledges to continue providing justice and hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities across the world,” the court said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We call on our 125 States Parties, civil society and all nations of the world to stand united for justice and fundamental human rights,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Friday praised Trump for imposing sanctions on the ICC, calling the court's actions against Israel "immoral" and illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday authorised economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of US citizens or American allies such as Israel, repeating the action he took during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who - along with his former defence minister and a leader of Palestinian militant group Hamas - is wanted by the ICC over the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions include freezing any US assets of those designated and barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125-member ICC is a permanent court that can prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression against the territory of member states or by their nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, China, Russia and Israel are not members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the executive order after US Senate Democrats last week blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the war crimes court. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Friday said the 9th Asian Winter Games embodies Asia’s shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and friendship.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcome banquet ahead of the Games’ opening in Harbin, he urged Asia to hold fast to the common dream of peace, respond to security challenges and contribute to building an equal and orderly multipolar world, Xinhua news agency reported.

  <br>
  Xi urged the region to seek common progress and inject impetus into economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pledged that the Winter Asian Games held in the northeastern city will put on a spectacular sports gala which will be distinctly Chinese and uniquely Asian.
  <br>
  <br>
  International dignitaries at the banquet in the capital of Heilongjiang province included Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee.

    'HK businesses won't be hugely affected by US tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on Friday said Hong Kong's businesses would not be hugely affected by the additional tariffs imposed by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US announced an extra 10 percent duties on Chinese imports that also covers goods from the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber's chairman Jonathan Choi said the issue is in the spotlight, but he is not worried about the impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The total percentage of trade between Hong Kong and the US is not very big. Therefore, actually it's not very much affected, but the way they do it is quite unfair to us," he spoke to reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said Hong Kong businesses are flexible and have started to explore new markets, such as in Asean and Middle East countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government is facing a deficit, and he hopes the financial secretary's budget - due to be announced later this month - could introduce measures to increase revenue and minimise spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said unprecedented global changes created more challenges to Hong Kong's economy, but support measures by the central government acted as a "guiding light" for the business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association said it expects growth in the SAR’s merchandise trade exports to slow down because of the additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Wingco Lo, said he agreed with the SAR government's decision to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over the US move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed confidence regarding Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying he expects GDP growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran on Friday condemned as "illegal" and "unjustified" new financial sanctions by the United States that target a network accused of shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Iranian crude oil to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The decision of the new US government to exert pressure on the Iranian nation by preventing Iran's legal trade with its economic partners is an illegitimate, illegal and violative measure," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US move was "categorically unjustified and contrary to international rules", Baqaei added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of the Treasury on Thursday announced financial sanctions against an international network "facilitating the shipment of millions of barrels of Iranian crude oil worth hundreds of millions of dollars" to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The oil was shipped on behalf of Iran's Armed Forces General Staff and a sanctioned front company called Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars, the treasury department wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions came after US President Donald Trump reinstated his "maximum pressure" policy against Iran over allegations the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has slammed the reinstatement of the policy -- similar to one Trump levied against Tehran during his first term as president -- saying pursuing it would end in "failure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the tough policy of sanctions during Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the deal -- known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action -- until a year after Washington pulled out, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the 2015 deal have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Wednesday called for a "verified nuclear peace agreement" with Iran, adding that it "cannot have a Nuclear Weapon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes and denies any intention to develop atomic weapons. (AFP)

 Hong Kong authorities don't need to carry out annual criminal record checks on teachers despite a rise in cases of misconduct, Education Secretary Christine Choi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers were told there were 304 professional misconduct cases involving teachers last year, three times the number in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy-one teachers were struck off last year, 38 got reprimand letters and 149 received written warnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the more serious cases involved child abuse, theft, and teachers having inappropriate relationships or improper physical contact with students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau currently checks the criminal records of all registered teachers every three years. But several legislators on the council's education panel said they were worried this is insufficient and checks should be made every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Choi said the rise in misconduct cases last year was actually a result of the bureau acting upon issues flagged up by criminal record checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the administration has a zero-tolerance approach regarding teachers who don't meet ethical or moral standards, but more frequent checks aren't necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If a teacher commits a crime while employed, we get the record immediately, so there's no need to wait three years. The checks conducted every three years are for those not currently working in schools who commit crimes that might not be reported,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the idea of requiring teachers to apply to renew their licence every 10 years, Choi said the bureau is always open-minded about ways to uphold professionalism.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation will be fined at least HK$1 million over disruption to East Rail Line services that lasted for more than seven hours on Wednesday, the government says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The money will be spent on rebates for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An engineer's train broke down near Tai Wo Station and remained on the tracks during the morning rush hour and up until lunchtime. Officials said intervals between trains were as long as 24 minutes at some stations during the disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to the preliminary information submitted by the MTR, this incident triggered the service performance rebate mechanism. This means the MTR will need to set aside at least HK$1 million as rebates for passengers,” Deputy Secretary for Transport and Logistics Kirk Yip told lawmakers on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the government has asked for a report into the incident within a month and wants to know what caused the train to break down and what improvement measures MTR officials come up with in case of similar issues in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR's Managing Director for Hong Kong Transport Services, Jeny Yeung, told legislators the company will learn from the incident and will look at how repairs can be carried out quicker if such a situation happens again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Special measures brought in before Christmas to deal with increased demand for A&E services will remain in place for now given the number of people turning up for treatment, the Hospital Authority said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Staff levels, bed capacity and laboratory testing services for flu and other viruses have been stepped up during the winter period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Manager Dr Larry Lee told RTHK that medical wards are operating at above 100 percent capacity and paediatric wards have also seen an increase in patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of patients has risen significantly. There are around 5,500 patients at accident and emergency units per day and around 1,100 patients are admitted to the general wards each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It seems that this pressure will continue, mainly because of the cold weather, and because of the public coming back from overseas travel and students returning to school."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said that in the past two weeks, 158 people were put in intensive care units or died due to influenza A, adding that this was a similar number to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said nine children suffered serious complications from their flu infections, and urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory has warned that temperatures could drop to nine degrees Celsius in urban areas on Sunday which it says could be a record low this winter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s speed skater Sidney Chu said his team is fully ready for the Asian Winter Games which will kick off in Harbin on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city is sending more than 70 athletes to participate in the Games this year, the largest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old speed skater was the flag bearer for the Hong Kong, China team at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said he will participate in eight races in speed skating and short-track speed skating this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We arrived and trained in Harbin five days ahead of the start of competition. That gives us enough time to get used to the temperature and the ice surface at the venue," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the ice is harder than what we are used to, we have adjusted our techniques, and the way we move and our equipment. I hope we can perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu and his teammates will also participate in the men's 5,000m relay and the mixed team 2,000m short-track speed skating relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time for SAR athletes to participate in relay races of short-track speed skating at large-scale competitions. This is a critical moment for us. I'm happy to see my team's growth and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athlete said he won the support of mainland audiences at the 2022 Games, and he hopes that he will not disappoint his supporters in Harbin.

<img alt="Amazon is on track to invest more than US$100 billion on cloud computing and artificial intelligence in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790640_1_20250207094326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Amazon reported strong earnings on Thursday but, like its big tech peers Microsoft and Google, saw its stock price fall on concerns over high AI investment costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mounting expenses of data-intensive artificial intelligence and its infrastructure have cast a shadow over this earnings season, with only Facebook owner Meta winning Wall Street's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's stock surged 18 percent in January as investors endorsed its AI strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's AWS cloud division, along with rivals Microsoft and Google, are investing heavily in AI data centres while meaningful returns remain uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the spending, saying the company was on track to spend US$100 billion on capital expenditure in 2025, with the "vast majority" on AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's lower-cost DeepSeek model has raised questions about such massive spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite US government efforts to maintain AI dominance through export controls on advanced chips, DeepSeek has achieved comparable results using authorised, less sophisticated Nvidia semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft, leading the generative AI revolution through its OpenAI partnership, plans to invest about US$80 billion in AI this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while it has rapidly deployed AI features under its Gemini brand, Google's Cloud revenue missed expectations, despite growing 30 percent to US$12 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google also announced plans for US$75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, surprising analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon on Thursday reported its fourth-quarter net income doubled to US$20 billion, with net sales rising 10 per cent to US$187.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  AWS remained profitable with sales growing 19 percent to US$28.8 billion, though slightly below market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Amazon's shares dropped more than five per cent in after-hours trading, mirroring reactions to Microsoft and Google's results - strong profits overshadowed by concerns about AI spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's forecast of five to nine per cent growth for the first quarter of 2025, with sales between US$151 billion and US$155.5 billion, also fell short of expectations and weighed on the stock price. (AFP)

    Fentanyl fatality rate 'higher in Canada than US'

<img alt="Edmonton, in Canada, holds an Overdose Awareness Day. File photo (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790650_1_20250207093916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fentanyl is killing more people per capita in Canada than in the United States, Ottawa's public safety minister said on Thursday, calling the two nations "connected" in combating the opioid crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has accused Canada of not doing enough to counter the flow of fentanyl across their shared border, and cited the issue as justification for his threatened import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has committed to addressing those concerns, while maintaining that less than one percent of fentanyl in the United States comes from Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On per capita population, we're losing more Canadians than Americans are losing Americans," Public Safety Minister David McGuinty told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are connected with this crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US estimates, an average of 205 Americans have died each day of opioid overdoses in recent years, mostly from fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada has seen 21 deaths per day, according to the latest data, but its population is about 12 times smaller than that of its southern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGuinty's remarks came after he met with senior federal police and border agency officials "to operationalise" a US$900 million border security plan launched in response to Trump's tariffs threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25 percent tariffs - which Trump has also said were necessary to force action to stem migrant crossings - were scheduled to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president granted Canada a 30-day reprieve to allow for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the last-minute deal to put off the tariffs, the prime minister agreed to name a point person to lead the fight against fentanyl. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post says it will continue to turn away postal items containing goods to the United States, even as the US Postal Service ditched its earlier suspension of inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes two days after Hongkong Post was told by its US counterpart not to dispatch packages containing goods, "unless a 'formal entry' has been completely and accurately filed with the United States Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the United States law".
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said in a statement early on Friday morning that Hongkong Post is now communicating with USPS to clarify certain matters, including the imposition of additional duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman reiterated the government's strong disapproval to charge additional duty for Hong Kong products, and urged Washington to rectify its wrongdoing to "avoid causing confusion and inconvenience to the public owing to its constantly changing policies".

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790638_1_20250207084628.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A judge on Thursday paused a scheme masterminded by billionaire Elon Musk to slash the size of the US government by encouraging federal workers to quit through a mass buyout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federal judge in Massachusetts ordered a temporary injunction on the plan's deadline - midnight Thursday - given by Musk for the country's more than two million government employees. The offer was to quit with eight months' pay or risk being fired in future culls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadline is now extended to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole will hold a hearing on the merits of the case brought by labour unions, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person and President Donald Trump's biggest donor, is in charge of a free-ranging entity called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, more than 40,000 staff have so far accepted the buyout deal - a relatively small number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unions representing some 800,000 civil servants and Democratic members of Congress are resisting the scheme and have challenged the legality of threats to fire civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the broader budget cutting campaign has already severely disrupted departments and agencies that for decades have run everything from education to national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID, the government's agency for distributing aid around the world, has been crippled, with foreign-based staff ordered home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also repeatedly said he wants to shut down the Department of Education. The inducements to resign have further been extended to the CIA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt told reporters that federal workers should "accept the very generous offer" of a deferred resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said "competent" replacements would be found for those who "want to rip the American people off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the controversies swirling around the Musk plan is how much access the South African-born tycoon is getting to secret government data, including the Treasury's entire payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that there was "a lot of misinformation" and that access to such data was only given to two Treasury employees who are working with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent said those employees had "read-only" access, meaning they couldn't change the data. (AFP)

 The former interpreter to Shohei Ohtani, who admitted stealing almost US$17 million from the Japanese baseball star to pay off illegal gambling debts, was sentenced to 57 months in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ippei Mizuhara was also ordered to pay restitution of more than US$18.1 million in his sentencing in federal court in Santa Ana, California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara pleaded guilty in June to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false tax return.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank fraud charge alone could have carried a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara was ordered to surrender to authorities on March 24. After his prison sentence, he will be subject to three years of supervised release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing by US District Judge John Holcomb caps a scandal that rocked Major League Baseball at the beginning of the 2024 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, whose pitching and hitting skills have drawn comparisons to Babe Ruth, had signed the richest contract in North American sports history to join the Los Angeles Dodgers last December, a deal worth US$700 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara, who had worked with Ohtani while he was with the Los Angeles Angels, came with him to the Dodgers, but the team fired him last April following accusations of theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara initially said Ohtani had loaned him money to repay gambling debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investigators found that he had stolen the money, with prosecutors saying Mizuhara siphoned millions from Ohtani to finance an "insatiable appetite" for illegal sports gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an initial April court appearance, Mizuhara's lawyer said his client wished to apologize to "Ohtani, the Dodgers and Major League Baseball" and "take responsibility" for his actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors stressed throughout the case that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception and there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool overturned a first leg deficit to reach the League Cup final with a 4-0 win and ramp up the pressure on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Dominik Szoboszlai and Virgil van Dijk were on target for the Reds, who will face Newcastle at Wembley on March 16 for the first silverware of the English season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool remain on course for a quadruple in a dream debut season for Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  They enjoy a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League, have cruised into the last 16 of the Champions League and visit Championship strugglers Plymouth in the FA cup fourth round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we had some big nights here already but yeah to reach a final should always be special, and that is what it is," said Slot. "In Holland we only have one cup competition and that final is played at the end of the season, so it is new experience but a nice one to have."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs' trophy drought on the other hand goes on. Tottenham last lifted silverware in 2008 and Postecoglou now has one less opportunity to fulfil his promise of winning a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is speculation the Australian could be shown the door if another goes awry away to Aston Villa in the FA Cup at the weekend with Spurs languishing 14th in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a great opportunity and unfortunately we didn't grab it," said Postecoglou. "There's still plenty to play for us this year. We have a huge game with Villa on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having more glamorous titles to win, Slot showed his desire to make the League Cup his first trophy as Liverpool boss by naming his strongest available team bar the usual rotation in goal for cup competitions as Caoimhin Kelleher replaced Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  New signing Kevin Danso was forced straight in to Tottenham's injury-ravaged defence, while Mathys Tel also made an early debut off the bench after Richarlison hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had scored four in each of the previous two meetings between the sides at Anfield and repeated that feat to make light of their 1-0 first leg defeat in north London last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side had taken the first quarter to find their stride but the pressure built after Szoboszlai ran offside before sweeping home Salah's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the Egyptian's next delivery into the box, Spurs did not escape as Gakpo drilled in first time to move clear as the top scorer in this season's competition with five goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antonin Kinsky kept Salah waiting for his goal with a fine save moments later, but at the other end of the field Richarlison lay prone to leave Postecoglou's team further depleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already without record signing Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert in attacking areas, Tottenham never looked capable of mounting the threat they needed to survive the Liverpool onslaught.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive blow came five minutes into the second half when Kinsky rushed off his line but was beaten to the ball by Darwin Nunez and caught the Uruguayan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah ruthlessly dispatched the resulting penalty into the top corner for his 26th goal of the season. Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch fired off the post as Liverpool put their foot down to kill the tie off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The killer third goal came 15 minutes from time when Connor Bradley, who excelled in the absence of the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold, played in Szoboszlai to slot home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Dijk then exposed Spurs' struggles defending set-pieces by heading in the fourth from a corner to rub salt in the visitors' wounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle are eying an end to their own 56-year wait for a major trophy after an impressive 4-0 humbling of Arsenal on aggregate in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Magpies have the unenviable task of stopping Slot's juggernaut if they are to do so. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended mixed, as investors studied the latest corporate earnings figures and waited for monthly payrolls data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790622_1_20250207054209.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended higher, while the Dow closed lower after a choppy trading session on Thursday, as investors studied earnings reports while awaiting Amazon's results after the bell and a key jobs report on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Drugmaker Eli Lilly rose after the company forecast annual profit largely above estimates, while fashion house Tapestry jumped on an annual sales and profit forecast increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Morris International advanced after the cigarette maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and forecast 2025 profit above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com ticked up ahead of its quarterly earnings report. Investors will look for updates on its artificial intelligence investments, after Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI model sharpened investor scrutiny of US tech giants' massive spending on the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, the main focus is corporate earnings. Tariffs are in the background," said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Amazon will be the sixth of the Magnificent Seven to report. The AI theme has been under quite a lot of volatility over the last few weeks with the DeepSeek news ... We’re watching tonight for any thoughts that (Amazon) has to say around that," Hill said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honeywell fell after the industrial and aerospace giant said it would split into three independently listed companies and forecast downbeat sales and profit for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 22.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,083.57, the Nasdaq Composite gained 99.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,791.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.65 points, or 0.3 percent to 44,747.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets saw a dismal start to the week when President Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs over the weekend, before suspending the levies on goods from Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January nonfarm payrolls report is due later on Friday, a crucial metric in gauging the state of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's rate path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders don't expect the Fed to adjust interest rates in its next meeting in March, but a cut is widely anticipated in June. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has apologised for its "lack of sensitivity" and taken down a panda-themed watch, after the product sparked a public outcry over the use of alligator skin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park had teamed up with a local tourbillon brand to introduce a watch, which featured the six giant pandas. The strap of the watch was said to be made with alligator leather.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the park expressed deep regret over the lack of sensitivity of the team in promoting a product that "does not meet the core values of conservation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The product has not been purchased by any consumers, and has been immediately removed from the shelves. We are discussing with our authorised partners on procuring other materials to make the watch straps," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park vowed to review its design, production and procurement guidelines while strengthening staff training to ensure its operations are consistent with the core values of conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts on social media and the store's website about the watch have been removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park had previously called on the public to refrain from purchasing and using crocodile products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also named a crocodile as an animal ambassador for visitors to learn about preserving local biodiversity.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday rejected the United States' claim that it negotiated free passage for government vessels through the Panama Canal as an "absolute falsehood."
 <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority, which runs the waterway linking the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean, has also rejected the claim by the US State Department that US government vessels would go through for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government, said it had not made any changes to charge fees or rights to cross the canal, adding its statement was directly in response to the US claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department had said earlier that Panama's government had agreed to no longer charge crossing fees for US government vessels, in a move that would save America millions of dollars a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With total responsibility, the Panama Canal Authority, as it has indicated, is willing to establish dialogue with relevant US officials regarding the transit of wartime vessels from said country," the canal authority responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as the president has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its trade passage, one of the busiest in the world. (Reuters)

    January sets 'surprising' heat record: EU monitor

<img alt="The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January according to the European climate service Copernicus. File photo: AFP ." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790589_1_20250206214334.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last month was the hottest January on record, Europe's climate monitor said on Thursday, despite expectations that cooler La Nina conditions might quell a streak of record-breaking global temperatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service said January was 1.75 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times, extending a persistent run of historic highs over 2023 and 2024, as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate scientists had expected this exceptional spell to subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in January 2024 and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the heat has lingered at record or near-record levels ever since, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what makes it a bit of a surprise... you're not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see," Julien Nicolas, a climate scientist from Copernicus, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Nina is expected to be weak and Copernicus said prevailing temperatures in parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean suggested "a slowing or stalling of the move towards" the cooling phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas said it could disappear completely by March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Copernicus said that global temperatures averaged across 2023 and 2024 had exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This did not constitute a permanent breach of the long-term 1.5C warming target under the Paris climate accord -- but was a clear sign that the limit was being tested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said Arctic sea ice in January hit a monthly record low, virtually tied with 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysis from the United States this week put it at the second-lowest in that dataset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, 2025 is not expected to follow 2023 and 2024 into the history books: scientists predict it will rank as the third hottest year yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Copernicus said it would be closely monitoring ocean temperatures throughout 2025 for hints about how the climate might behave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oceans are a vital climate regulator and carbon sink, and cooler waters can absorb greater amounts of heat from the atmosphere, helping to lower air temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also store 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by humanity's release of greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This heat is bound to resurface periodically," said Nicolas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's also one of the questions -- is this what has been happening over the past couple of years?" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy head of a local chamber for small to medium-sized firms on Thursday said companies from mainland China and Hong Kong focused on e-commerce may still have profit margins, despite higher US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US authorities began charging an extra 10 percent levy on top of existing tariffs, and cancelled a tax exemption for parcels with a retail value of US$800 or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vice president of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, Stanley Lee, said while the tariff rise might have come abruptly, some products can still be competitive in the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, in traditional retail, it costs US$20 to buy an item. It's US$15 for them to buy on [American] online platforms, but it's US$10 on [Chinese] e-platforms before the rise," he explained to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So even with [25 to 35 percent extra tariffs], it's still cheaper to buy [Chinese products] than the traditional way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who also heads the chamber's e-commerce policy committee, said his own firm was relatively unaffected by the new US policies, as his products are stored in warehouses on American soil and they clear customs regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects some mainland e-commerce firms to do the same if they no longer find the parcel-mailing strategy profitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that companies mostly expected the trade spat to intensify, and have therefore turned to different markets in search for potential customers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower, which was engulfed in flames more than seven years ago in a disaster that killed 72 people, will be demolished, bereaved families and survivors said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire ripped through the 23-storey social housing block in one of London's richest areas during the early hours of June 14, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Britain's deadliest blaze in a residential building since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell Next of Kin (GNK), which represents the relatives of nearly half of those who died, said Britain's deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, announced her decision to a room of families and survivors in a meeting on Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the group, the demolition of the tower, which remains standing but covered in protective wrap, will only start after the eighth anniversary of the tragedy in June this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engineers advising the government said the structure of the tower would worsen over time, and the building or part of it that was significantly damaged should be carefully taken down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do we wish the whole tower could stand forever? Yes. Is that an option? Not from a structural point of view," GNK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United said the voices of bereaved families and survivors were not heard or considered by Rayner during what they described as a short four-week consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ignoring the voices of bereaved on the future of our loved ones' gravesite is disgraceful and unforgivable," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department of housing, communities and local government did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but the decision was confirmed by Joe Powell, the member of parliament for Kensington, the area where the tower is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said on X that the decision had not been taken lightly: "Grenfell Tower will always be in our hearts as a community."
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry into the fire, which published its final report last year, blamed the disaster on failings by the government, construction industry and, most of all, the firms involved in fitting the exterior with flammable cladding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several survivors and families have said the inquiry has delayed any criminal proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A commission looking at a future memorial on the site of the disaster said in its 2023 report that if the tower came down it should be "dismantled with care and respect".
  <br>
  <br>
  A final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An eight-vehicle pile-up on the West Kowloon Corridor in Cheung Sha Wan on Thursday afternoon has left at least three people injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received reports at around 5pm of the collision involving six private cars, a taxi and a small truck heading west towards Mei Foo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online footage from the scene showed the taxi wedged between some of the vehicles, suffering severe damage to the rear, while at least one of the private cars had a shattered windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said drivers of three of the vehicles were sent to hospital. One was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital while the other two were rushed to Caritas Medical Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some lanes of the West Kowloon Corridor near Hing Wah Street were closed due to the incident, and advised drivers to consider alternative options.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) Betty Fung on Thursday said the arts hub's operating deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to be HK$1 billion, similar to that of the previous year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press event, Fung said the number of visitors to the district last year was lower than expected, and revenue from ticket sales and museum merchandise fell 20 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hub's catering businesses also brought in lower revenues than expected, she said, adding that the authority will continuing operating on loans for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pledged that the WKCDA will continue to strictly manage its expenditure, while rolling out more exhibitions to attract visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those planned for this year include an exhibition of more than 60 works of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso at the M+ museum between March and July, and a special exhibition featuring Chinese cuisine and related artworks at the Hong Kong Palace Museum between March and June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palace Museum will also hold the city's largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian treasures for decades, with some 250 objects loaned from several influential museums.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cash-scrapped authority aims to submit a development application to the Town Planning Board in the coming weeks for building housing blocks on a plot in the area spanning 20,000 square metres.

    Honda-Nissan merger in doubt: sources

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida met with his Honda counterpart Toshihiro Mibe on Thursday to say he wanted to end their merger talks after the larger automaker proposed making Nissan a subsidiary, said a source with knowledge of the matter.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese automakers in December signed a memorandum of understanding to discuss an integration under a holding company to create the world's third largest automaker and compete in an increasingly tough industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the talks have been complicated by growing differences, multiple people familiar with the matter have told international media, and hit a wall after Honda said it wanted to turn Nissan into a subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A consensus was reached (on Nissan's side) that the talks cannot proceed under that proposal," said the source with knowledge of the discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan will formalise the decision to withdraw from the MOU at a board meeting to be held before the company's third-quarter earnings announcement next week, the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda's current stance is it would not accept an integration unless Nissan agrees to become a subsidiary, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda is Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota, and Nissan is the third-largest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan and Honda spokespeople declined to comment on the status of their talks, repeating earlier statements that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  A scrapping of the talks raises questions about how Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, can ride out its latest crisis without external help. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 workers and 20 percent of global capacity. (Reuters)

 President Xi Jinping said China and Thailand should continue to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement and security in talks with visiting Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Noting that Beijing appreciates efforts by Bangkok to fight online gambling and telecom fraud, Xi said that both nations should boost cooperation to safeguard people's lives and property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said Thailand is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with China and other neighbouring countries, and take resolute and effective measures to crack down on cross-border crimes including online gambling and telecom fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity to some areas in Myanmar by its border to try to disrupt the operations of the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  On other bilateral issues, Xi said Beijing is willing to work on a new railway project between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader also met National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji, who said the vision and direction of the leaders of the two countries led to the sound and steady development of bilateral ties over the long term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visit to China was Paetongtarn's first as prime minister and comes as the two countries celebrate 50 years of establishing diplomatic relations. (Xinhua & agencies)

    'Cross-border e-commerce unaffected by policy changes'

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry urged the US to create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790546_1_20250206171534.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said cross-border e-commerce remained competitive despite the scrapping of America's de minimis exemption for the import of small goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how a country adjusts its trade policy, the advantages and characteristics of cross-border e-commerce have not disappeared, and are still very competitive," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we hope that the US can follow the development trend of international trade, enhance supervision, and create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce."
  <br>
  <br>
  The elimination of the duty-free exemption for low value packages and US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports have caused confusion, with the US Postal Services reversing a decision not to accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tariffs on Chinese goods went ahead on Tuesday, Trump suspended his threats of imposing levies on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move, He said Beijing is ready to work with other countries to "jointly respond to the challenges of unilateralism and trade protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates World Trade Organisation rules. It is egregious in nature, and a typical unilateral trade protectionism that damages the rules-based multilateral trading system, disrupts the stability of global supply chains, and exacerbates international trade tensions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China does not proactively initiate trade disputes but will take necessary measures in response to one-sided bullying, He added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal has rejected a bid by the Communications Authority (CA) to challenge a ruling over the now-defunct RTHK programme
 <i>
  Headliner
 </i>
 .
 <br>
  <br>
  Last September, the court quashed the authority's finding that a 2020 episode of the satirical show breached broadcasting rules by denigrating the police and failing to ensure that its content was accurate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CA then applied to take the matter to the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the Court of Appeal dismissed the application and ordered the authority to pay costs of HK$180,000, ruling that the CA had failed to distinguish the content of the programme as fact or personal opinion.

 The vice-chancellor of Chinese University, Professor Dennis Lo, says the institution is ready to handle any funding cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Education minister Christine Choi said earlier that the University Grants Committee will adjust funding for the city's eight public universities over the next three years, due to a significant government deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We know there are challenges in public finance. We only heard about the government adjusting funding of universities through media reports. We don’t have any confirmed information yet. But as part of society, we will go through tough times together,” Lo said at a media gathering on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CUHK president also laid out the university's next five-year plan, saying the main focus will be on enhancing the student experience, boosting innovation and research, attracting talent, improving alumni engagement and promoting internationalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan includes offering more special professor roles to attract overseas academics to join the university, as well as possibly establishing a graduate college, Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK also announced that its new Zhizhen School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences will open from the next academic year, with renowned mathematics professor Yau Shing-tung serving as the founding director.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school will offer an eight-year bachelor and PhD degree programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK said it hopes to have 40 students with special mathematics talent in the inaugural year, with at least 10 of them being locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students as young as those in secondary two can apply, without the need to take any university admission exam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday warned that war-ravaged Gaza is not a political bargaining chip, following a proposal to take over the region from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiankun said China firmly supports the "legitimate national rights" of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people. It is an inalienable part of the territory of Palestine, not a bargaining chip for political games," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly supports the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, believes that Palestinians governing Palestine is an important principle that must be upheld in the post-conflict governance of Gaza, and opposes the forced displacement of the people of Gaza,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a growing number of countries blocking access to DeepSeek, Guo said Beijing has never asked firms to illegally store data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government attaches great importance to data privacy and security, and protects it in accordance with the law. We have never asked and will never ask any companies or individuals to collect or store data against the laws," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has all along opposed the move to overstretch the concept of national security, or politicise trade and tech issues. We will firmly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea became the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on the Chinese artificial intelligence startup, saying the firm did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.

    'Removal of de minimis exemption a blow for retailers'

<img alt="Cheap fashion retailers, such as Temu and Shein, are expected to take a hit due to the new US tariffs. File photo: Reuters." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790517_1_20250206140306.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The scrapping of America’s de minimis exemption for the import of small goods will deal a blow to small cross-border retailers, increase burdens on consumers, while shaking Hong Kong's status as an international logistics centre, according to analysts and industry insiders.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the White House announced it would end the de minimis exemption which allowed low-value packages, under US$800, to be shipped to America duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of the exemption was a result of the additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players like Shein and Temu, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Thursday, Alan Lung, political analyst and co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the removal of the exemption would affect the SAR as well as small mainland shippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of the small parcels that are shipped through e-traders, like Temu and Shein, are shipped through Hong Kong. The scrapping of the US$800 exemption simply increases the costs to consumers and makes it more complicated for custom clearances," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Companies like Alibaba are not really affected because their warehouses in the US, and they have their own customs clearances in blocks, it's the smaller shippers that will go bust," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms like Shein and Temu have become enormously popular in the US in recent years due to their budget-friendly products, and a US congressional report showed that over 80 percent of American e-commerce shipments in 2022 were from de minimis imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lung, Aditya Halan, Chief Technology Officer at Floship, an e-commerce and logistics service provider based in the SAR, said on the same programme that some logistics companies in the region have already increased their fees - due to the tariff changes and general business uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is changing by the day. So everybody is trying to be secure... to put on a random block on the amount, and we commit as we pay back as actuals later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halan also warned that such tariff hikes could hinder the SAR's status as a global logistics centre in the long term, as brands look for ways to manufacture their products elsewhere, away from the mainland, to skip the tariff duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the brands start manufacturing outside China, the logistics will follow that trend as well, so many people will start setting up logistics hubs elsewhere, then there will be a risk for Hong Kong as a logistic centre.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States said on Wednesday that its government vessels would be allowed to sail for free through the Panama Canal, following heavy pressure from President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  "US government vessels can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year," the State Department said in a post on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first public announcement of promises hinted at by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said that Panama offered concessions during his talks on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said he had told Panama that it was unfair for the United States to be in a position to defend the vital waterway and also to be charged for its use.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Panama are scheduled to hold new talks on Friday to discuss the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama has became a focal point of the Trump administration as President Donald Trump has accused the Central American country of charging excessive rates to use its passage. (AFP/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's industry ministry has temporarily blocked employee access to Chinese artificial intelligence startup, DeepSeek, a ministry official said, after it did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier issued a notice calling on ministries and agencies to exercise caution about using AI services including DeepSeek and ChatGPT at work, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power said it had blocked use of AI services including DeepSeek earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean defence ministry has also blocked access to DeepSeek on its computers that are for military use, officials said on Thursday, and the foreign ministry has restricted access to DeepSeek in computers that connect to external networks, Yonhap News Agency said. The ministry said it cannot confirm specific security measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the ministries had taken any actions against ChatGPT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban makes South Korea the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia banned DeepSeek this week from all government devices over concerns on how it uses data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch by the Chinese startup of its latest AI models last month sent shockwaves through the tech world. The company says its models are on a par with or better than products developed in the United States and are produced at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has said it used less-advanced H800 chips - permitted for sale to China until 2023 under US export controls - to power its large learning model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have also said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration that could lead to faster breakthroughs. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported, as the two countries eye closer ties amid growing global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn is on an official visit to China from February 5 to 8, marking her first visit to the country since taking office in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader's visit also came on the same day that Thailand began cutting electricity, fuel and internet services to areas in Myanmar along Thailand-Myanmar borders to tackle online fraud, an issue believed to be high on the agenda during the prime minister's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Xi and Paetongtarn also come as Beijing is navigating a new trade war with the United States, triggered by US President Donald Trump's 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. (Reuters)

    US tariffs 'wrong' and must be rectified: Algernon Yau

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Thursday criticised the United States for imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports – which also covers goods from Hong Kong – and called on the Trump administration to rectify the situation as soon as possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said higher US tariffs won't have much of an impact on the SAR, citing 2023 figures showing HK$6.1 billion worth of exports to the US represented only about 0.1 percent of the city's total exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can see that the impact on Hong Kong should not be huge," the commerce minister told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But most importantly, the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US is very unreasonable and ignores the rules of an international organisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said Hong Kong merchants have diversified supply chains and manufacturing locations, in view of the shift in the geopolitical landscape and international trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has filed a complaint with the WTO over the tariffs, saying the actions by Washington are protectionist and break the trade body's rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme, Tim Huxley, chairman of Mandarin Shipping, said the tariffs won't have a strong negative impact on the local shipping industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong... is a significant shipowning centre, but it's also very much driven by shipping services. There’s a lot more to Hong Kong shipping than the container port, which is important. But when Hong Kong-owned ships are trading all over the world, they're carrying bulk cargoes, oil, as well as containers. So that will not have a huge impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong, remember, is very much now a service-driven economy... Maritime lawyers, bankers, insurance brokers, all these are the services that go on to make the shipping industry a large contributor to Hong Kong's economy," Huxley said.

 Three puppies found dead in Sheung Shui are suspected to have been poisoned, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they had opened an animal cruelty investigation following the discovery of the dogs' bodies near a warehouse in Lin Tong Mei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vomit was found next to the puppies, who were around two months old, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another dog was found alive and was handed over to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  No arrests had been made, police said.

  District councillor Corey Lau said he joined animal rescue volunteers in saving two injured dogs from the same site late last month, and they had also spotted several puppies there.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to settle the two rescued dogs and then we planned to return to the place and save the puppies. However, when we returned to the scene, we found that three of the puppies had already died and one was barely alive inside the warehouse," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said he had come across more than 50 cases of dog poisonings in the past three months, many of them in North District and Yuen Long.

<img alt="The trade ends a months-long falling out saga between the six-time NBA All-Star and the Miami Heat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790492_1_20250206110848.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The saga of star forward Jimmy Butler's falling out with the Miami Heat has reportedly ended with his trade to the Golden State Warriors ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic – citing unnamed team sources – reported that the Heat were finalising a deal to send Butler to the Warriors on a two-year, US$121 million extension through 2027 in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, Kyle Anderson and a first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler and the Heat had been at odds for months. The 35-year-old was still serving his third suspension by the team "due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, whose 17 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in 25 games this season is his lowest scoring average since the 2013 to 2014 season, had indicated in early January that he wanted to be traded, with the Heat apparently unwilling to provide the lucrative contract extension he sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler arrived in Miami from Philadelphia in 2019, leading them to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023. At Golden State, he will bolster the aging star duo of Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors are currently battling for a play-in berth in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the deal came together about an hour before the Warriors took on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City, where coach Steve Kerr suddenly closed the locker room to address his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors had reportedly expressed an interest in bringing Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant back to Golden State. Durant won NBA titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, but ESPN reported Wednesday night that he was not interested in a return to the Bay Area and it was unclear if any other move for him was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks traded All-Star forward Khris Middleton to the Washington Wizards for Kyle Kuzma, according to multiple reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal also sends forward Patrick Baldwin and a second-round 2025 NBA Draft pick while the Wizards also obtained guard A.J. Johnson and a first-round pick swap in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, 26-22, made the swap with the NBA-worst Wizards to land 29-year-old forward Kuzma, who has averaged 15.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton, 33, helped the Bucks win the NBA crown in 2021 and had been a mainstay of the team since coming over in a 2013 trade after spending his rookie campaign in Detroit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent off-season surgeries on both ankles and did not make his debut this season until December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wizards made another deal, according to ESPN, sending Lithuanian centre Jonas Valanciunas to the Sacramento Kings for two second-round draft picks and 20-year-old French guard Sidy Cissoko.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kings will unite newcomers Valanciunas and Zach LaVine and try to fight into a playoff spot. They rank eighth in the Western Conference at 25-24 – the same record as Phoenix and Golden State. (AFP)

    Trump bans trans athletes from women's sports

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From now on women's sports will be only for women," Trump said before he signed the order at the White House, surrounded by dozens of children and female athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With this executive order the war on women's sports is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson and firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were among those in the audience to watch the signing ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls," Trump added to applause and cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated... and risk your federal funding," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would now push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. (AFP)

    China launches dispute at WTO over Trump tariffs

<img alt="China says the US tariffs are discriminatory and violate its obligations to the WTO. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790466_1_20250206085516.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China filed a World Trade Organisation complaint on Wednesday against US President Donald Trump's new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and his cancellation of a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, arguing the actions are "protectionist" and break WTO rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's request for US trade consultations came as confusion reigned among shippers and retailers over Trump's cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption for package imports valued under US$800.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tax exemption has benefitted e-commerce firms including Shein, Temu and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Customs and Border Protection official said all small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong needed to have customs entries on file prior to arrival, and there was the potential for some cargo to be sent back without this paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent, Simon Marks, said this could lead to significant delays in package deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So recipients are going to be told in order for you to receive delivery of this package, before you get it, you have to pay the duty, and that will then release the package from Customs," he told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1003719&livetime=20250206000000">
   <b>
    <u>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </u>
   </b>
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely going to delay substantially, at least to begin with, the delivery of these items here in the United States, because the customer service is going to have to look at every single one of them - and there are a vast number of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marks warned that apart from the supply chain disruption, consumers will also feel the pinch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Businesses] either have to absorb the tariffs, or they have to raise the price of the good that they are bringing in from outside the country and providing to American consumers," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's why so many economists here have argued that President Donald Trump and members of his economic inner circle simply don't understand the costs of tariffs to the American consumers, that they are inherently inflationary."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTO said China submitted a request for consultations with the US on the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request for consultations is the start of a dispute process that could lead to a ruling that Trump's duties violated trade rules in the same manner that a 2020 WTO ruling found that his first-term China tariffs broke trade regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such a victory would be unlikely to bring Beijing relief because the WTO's Appellate Body has been largely inoperable for years, as the US has blocked the appointment of appellate judges over what it views as judicial overreach by the body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body is unable to function with fewer than three judges. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Delta aircraft clipped by taxiing JAL plane on tarmac

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Japan Airlines plane that was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta aircraft on Wednesday morning, airport authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities responded to the incident around 10:17am, the airport said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  All passengers from Japan Airlines flight 68 and Delta Air Lines flight 1921 were deplaned with no reported injuries, and response crews were working to move the aircraft off the ramp taxiway, the airport said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta spokesperson Samantha Moore Facteau said in an email that its Boeing 737 was waiting to have ice removed from its exterior when the wing tip of another aircraft reportedly made contact with its tail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deicing, as it's known, can occur before a flight begins to taxi to the runway, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 142 passengers on board the flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and they were transferred to a new aircraft, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reports of injuries for crew or passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Chan, one of the passengers on the Delta flight, said the plane “jiggled back and forth” and shook a little bit when the collision occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, the captain announced that the plane's tail had been hit. Passengers remained calm, Chan said, and eventually got off the plane to be taken back to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport operations were minimally impacted because the incident occurred on a taxi lane, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, spokesperson Sam Lichtman said in an emailed statement. (AP)

    NFL to play 2026 regular season game in Melbourne

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NFL has announced it will stage its first-ever regular season game in Australia in the 2026 season with the Melbourne Cricket Ground hosting the contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter O'Reilly, head of NFL International, said the designated team in that game would be the Los Angeles Rams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game at the 100,000-capacity MCG will be part of a "multi-year" arrangement as the league continues its global expansion. O'Reilly indicated that the game could be played in Week One to allow teams plenty of time to acclimatise after the long flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL has already played regular season games in London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Toronto.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL can now schedule up to eight league-operated international regular season games per season.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the NFL has confirmed games in London, Berlin and Madrid as part of the international games slate
  <br>
  <br>
  "Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the Victorian State Government, Visit Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and with the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NFL International has an office in Australia which has been working on the deal for almost three years and there had been intense efforts from the state government to secure Melbourne as the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're thrilled the NFL will be touching down in the sporting capital of Australia," said Premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan in the league statement. "Victoria is now the first-ever state in Australia to host a regular season NFL game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a win for jobs, a win for businesses and a win for fans who will get to see American football played at the iconic MCG," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 MotoGP world champion Jorge Martin has been ruled out of the remaining pre-season testing in Malaysia and will undergo surgery in Europe after crashing badly on the opening day at the Sepang track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard broke his hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia machine at turn two of the Sepang circuit. He had emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He now faces a race against time to be fit for the start of his title defence in the season-opening Thailand Grand Prix on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jorge Martin has been diagnosed with a right hand fracture and fractures in his left foot," MotoGP organisers said in a statement. "He has undergone a CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), both of which were negative for any injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will stay in hospital overnight and tomorrow he will fly back to Europe to undergo surgery on his right hand and left foot."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old, who made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati, had completed 13 laps when he lost control of his new bike and was flipped high into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard landed hard on his left foot before his head banged onto the asphalt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massimo Rivola, Principal of Aprilia Racing, said he had "no explanation" for the crash and that Martin had made "no mistake".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bad crash with apparently no reason from his side and from the bike," he said. "He is a world champion, but he is also a MotoGP rider. He's not an amateur. And the bike had no problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trackhouse team rider Raul Fernandez of Spain was also ruled out of the remaining two days with hand and foot fractures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Fabio Quartararo, meanwhile, topped the timesheets on the opening day of testing with a time of 1min 57.555sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was feeling quite good. We were focused on many things to try and make a good lap time and I think I did a good job," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Yamaha rider was fastest for most parts of Wednesday's session and claimed the fastest time on his 50th lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six-time Spanish MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez came in second fastest with a time of 1:57.606 on his new Ducati machine, while his brother Alex Marquez was third after clocking 1:57.738. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Wednesday appeared to walk back elements of President Donald Trump's shock plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza and launch a US takeover of the devastated territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Trump said "the US will take over" and "own" Gaza and that Palestinians would "go to other countries," the administration sought to downplay expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Republican leader wanted Palestinians to be only "temporarily relocated" out of Gaza instead of permanently resettled in Arab-majority states like Egypt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the rebuilding of Gaza would not be paid for by the United States and that US troops were not likely to be sent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza, it does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Trump has been "very clear" that "he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees, temporarily, so that we can rebuild their home."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the deployment of US troops into Gaza was being ruled out, Leavitt said: "The president has not committed to that just yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is ready to "look at all options" when asked if he was working on options to deploy troops to Gaza, but did not provide specifics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options," Hegseth told journalists as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump's idea "was not meant as hostile. It was meant as, I think, a very generous move – the offer to rebuild and to be in charge of the rebuilding."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump wants to support "rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature, so that then people can move back in," Rubio told reporters on a visit to Guatemala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's surprise announcement on Tuesday sparked intense pushback from the Palestinian leadership and governments in the region and in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes in the context of mediated negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas to reach the "second phase" of a ceasefire deal that would bring a more permanent end to the devastating war in Gaza. (AFP)

    Newcastle sweep aside Arsenal, reach League Cup final

<img alt="Newcastle's Anthony Gordon at the end of the English League Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790457_1_20250206070552.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle swept into the League Cup final for the second time in three seasons with a vibrant 2-0 win against Arsenal in the semi-final second leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side took the lead through Jacob Murphy's first half strike at raucous St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon sealed Newcastle's 4-0 aggregate victory as Arsenal paid the price for some unusually slack defending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, who have beaten Arsenal three times this season, will face Liverpool or Tottenham in the final at Wembley on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham hold a 1-0 lead heading into Thursday's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having won the first leg 2-0 at Arsenal in January, Newcastle held their nerve to finish the job in front of their frenzied fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies are one step away from a first major trophy since winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe's team were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United in the 2023 League Cup final, while Newcastle have also lost the 1999, 1998 and 1974 FA Cup finals since their last silverware.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is 70 years since Newcastle lifted a major domestic trophy by winning the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finally winning a cup would be a huge moment for Newcastle, who have been transformed from serial underachievers to trophy contenders thanks to Howe's astute management and the financial backing of their Saudi owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, Newcastle have been forced to curtail their initial spending spree by profit and sustainability rules, but Howe has kept them upwardly mobile.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the high of thrashing Manchester City 5-1 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep their title challenge alive, Mikel Arteta's team came back down to earth with a bump on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has only won the 2020 FA Cup since taking charge at Arsenal in 2019 and this was another missed opportunity to end that drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United, the Gunners are through to the Champions League last 16 and sit six points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubbing salt into Arsenal's wounds, Newcastle fans sang "Mikel Arteta. It must the ball" in a cutting reference to the Spaniard's complaints that the different ball used in the League Cup had played a role in the first leg defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta admitted he was "disappointed" that Arsenal failed to sign a striker before the transfer window closed on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have lost Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka to long-term injuries and their lack of cutting edge was exposed in the face of Newcastle's well-drilled back five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard squandered a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead, blasting wildly against the post from close-range. It was a crucial miss as Newcastle punished Odegaard's profligacy in the 19th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak started the move by winning a header in front of William Saliba before breaking onto Gordon's pass into the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker slammed a fierce drive against the post, with the rebound falling perfectly for the Murphy to guide an agile finish into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murphy's fifth goal in all competitions this season sparked bedlam in the stands as Newcastle started to dream of Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka had to make a good save to repel Leandro Trossard's close-range effort moments later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak, a muscular combination of power and poise, was tormenting the usually rock-solid Arsenal defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to cope with Newcastle's relentless high press, Arsenal were disarray at the back and it was no surprise when Gordon delivered the knockout blow in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal keeper David Raya played a poor pass to Declan Rice on the edge of the area and Fabian Schar's crunching tackle sent the ball towards Gordon, who seized the chance with a clinical finish from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gordon celebrated by holding aloft a black and white scarf thrown onto the pitch as Newcastle's party started in earnest. (AFP)

    Nissan calls off Honda merger talks, Nikkei says

<img alt="Honda and Nissan said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790418_2_20250206060147.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nissan is set to call off merger talks with rival Honda, a source said on Wednesday, abandoning a US$60 billion-plus tie-up that would have created the world's number 3 automaker and raising questions about how it will drive a turnaround by itself.
 <br>
  <br>
  Talks have been complicated by growing differences between the two Japanese automakers, two people familiar with the matter, both of whom declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan shares slid more than 4 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which temporarily suspended trading in the stock after a Nikkei business daily report that it would pull out. Honda shares continued to trade and finished the day up more than 8 percent, in a sign of apparent investor relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development will raise fresh questions about how hard-hit Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan and aims to cut 9,000 employees and 20 percent of global capacity, can ride out its latest crisis without external help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota , and Nissan, its third-largest, said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales, bulking up in an industry facing a huge threat from China's BYD and other electric vehicle entrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported earlier that Nissan could call off talks after Honda had sounded it out about becoming a subsidiary. Nissan baulked because this was a departure from what was originally framed as a merger of equals, one source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan and Honda said in separate statements that the Nikkei report was not based on information announced by the companies and that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February and announce it at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, whose market value of about 7.92 trillion yen (US$51.90 billion) is more than five times bigger than Nissan at 1.44 trillion yen, was increasingly worried about its smaller rival's progress on the turnaround plan, said a second source.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie-up talks have coincided with disruption posed by potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Tariffs against Mexico would be more painful for Nissan than for Honda or Toyota, analysts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors may get concerned about Nissan's future (and) turnaround," said Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun, adding: "Nissan also has a larger risk exposure to US-Mexico tariffs than Honda and Toyota." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Wednesday, propelled by resurgent optimism about AI, and fading concern about the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.7 percent to 44,873, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to close at 6,061.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq edged up 0.2 percent to 19,692, held down by a 7.3 percent fall in the share price of Google's parent company Alphabet following disappointing quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was some good news for companies linked to the artificial intelligence revolution, after Alphabet's pledge to invest US$75 billion in capital expenditure related to AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has kind of separated out the weakness seen in Alphabet as sort of just an Alphabet issue," said Briefing.com's Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You take that big CapEx number and that's a little bit staggering, obviously," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they're going to spend 75 billion dollars in 2025, that should be pretty good for, you know, a company like Nvidia," he added, referring to the major chip designer whose shares closed up 5.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had "helped energise the AI trade a bit," he added. (AFP)

    Monkeys attack tourists at Angkor Wat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency that runs the Unesco-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of "aggressive" macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but the Apsara National Authority said human interaction – particularly by people filming content to post online – had changed their behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has "changed the monkeys' natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal food, and cause injuries among people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, said that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples," he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for "an appropriate solution" to the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia's top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Popular sushi chain Sushiro on Wednesday expressed concern after a video showing a boy apparently putting a communal tong in his mouth at one of its restaurants was circulated online.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video showed the boy playing with a tong – used to pick up slices of ginger – with his hand and mouth, before dropping the utensil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All ginger slice containers and ginger slice tongs in the store have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected," Sushiro said in a statement in response to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sushiro Hong Kong severely condemns this behaviour and will seriously respond to this incident, including taking relevant legal actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chain also said it will reconsider the way it provides cutlery and plates, adding it will strictly implement quality control measures.

    USPS to resume parcel services from mainland China, HK

<img alt="USPS had temporarily suspended parcel services from mainland China and Hong Kong before the apparent U-turn. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790417_2_20250205212748.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Postal Service (USPS) has said it will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came less than a day after USPS said it would temporarily suspend the service, following US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports starting on Tuesday alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Effective February 5, 2025, the Postal Service will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts," USPS said in a statement put out late on Wednesday local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that its working to "implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery".
  <br>
  <br>
  The earlier suspension was denounced by Beijing, which called it "unreasonable suppression".
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing had also announced countermeasures to US tariffs on Tuesday, including tariffs of 10-15 percent on certain American imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government in a statement on Wednesday night strongly condemned the US measures, saying it might file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US' imposition of additional duty on products of Hong Kong ignores the basic fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a founding member of the WTO, the HKSAR has all along been upholding the principle of free and unimpeded trade. We strongly oppose any attempts to undermine Hong Kong's reputation and erode our status as a separate customs territory," the statement added.

 The annual Operation Santa Claus charity drive raised more than HK$13.2 million this year, organisers RTHK Radio 3 and the South China Morning Post announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A closing ceremony was held in Central in the evening, attended by donors, beneficiaries, as well as the senior management of RTHK and the SCMP. They presented a large cheque for the amount of HK$13,267,888 on stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We thank all donors for their selfless giving, which not only brought warmth to disadvantaged groups, but also provided tangible support to enhance their quality of life," said Acting Assistant Director of Broadcasting Angel Cheng.
  <br>
  <br>
  SCMP's chief operating officer, Kevin Huang added that Operation Santa Claus "has always been that benchmark and that gold standard in terms of giving back to our community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since its establishment in 1988, the campaign has raised more than HK$396 million and supported over 364 charities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 campaign, themed "Everyday Heroes", funded 11 charities focusing on children, the elderly, environmental causes, and medical services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest during a suturing procedure at Yan Chai Hospital last May has died, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai Sum-yuet had been in intensive care in Princess Margaret Hospital since her heart stopped beating for 18 minutes while she was being given stitches for a head wound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two staff members were later charged with ill-treatment or neglect over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Kowloon West hospital cluster said the girl's condition deteriorated earlier this week and she died on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman expressed deep sadness over the death, adding that the cluster will do what it can to help the girl's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital cluster takes this incident very seriously and will fully cooperate with relevant judicial proceedings. The case has been referred to the coroner for follow-up," the spokesman said.

    China vows 'necessary measures' over parcel halt

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has urged the United States to stop "politicising trade and economic issues" and vowed to take unspecified "necessary measures" after the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced it had temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The USPS said the suspension will remain in place until further notice, with the move coming after US President Donald Trump slapped extra tariffs on Chinese imports and ended a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government calls on the United States to stop politicising and weaponising trade and economic issues, stop going after or suppressing Chinese companies," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said Beijing "deplores and firmly opposes" the move by Washington regarding Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, China announced countermeasures of tariffs on a number of US goods, which will take effect next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What [action] China takes is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners. Threatening China with pressure leads nowhere," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the United States to correct its wrongdoings, solve each side's concerns through equal-footed consultation, and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of China-US relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also called for dialogue between China and the US after Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said what is needed is not unilateral, additional tariffs but exchanges based on equality and mutual respect.

    People frustrated with postal suspension from HK to US

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.
