    Microplastics fear for those who chew gum

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chewing gum releases hundreds of tiny plastic pieces straight into people's mouths, researchers said on Tuesday, also warning of the pollution created by the rubber-based sweet.
 <br>
  <br>
  The small study comes as researchers have increasingly been discovering small shards of plastic called microplastics throughout the world, from the tops of mountains to the bottom of the ocean – and even in the air we breathe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also been discovered microplastics riddled throughout human bodies – including inside our lungs, blood and brains – sparking fears about the potential effect this could be having on health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to alarm people," said Sanjay Mohanty, the lead researcher behind the new study.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no evidence directly showing that microplastics are harmful to human health, said Mohanty of the University of California, Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new pilot study instead sought to illustrate yet another little-researched way that these mostly invisible plastic pieces enter our bodies  – chewing gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Lowe, a PhD student at UCLA, chewed seven pieces each of 10 brands of gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the researchers ran a chemical analysis on her saliva.
  <br>
  <br>
  They found that a gram of gum released an average of 100 microplastic fragments, though some shed more than 600.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average weight of a stick of gum is around 1.5 grams.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who chew around 180 pieces of gum a year could be ingesting roughly 30,000 microplastics, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This pales in comparison to the many other ways that humans ingest microplastics, Mohanty emphasised.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, other researchers estimated last year that a litre of water in a plastic bottle contained an average of 240,000 microplastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most common chewing gum sold in supermarkets is called synthetic gum, which contains petroleum-based polymers to get that chewy effect, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, packaging does not list any plastics in the ingredients, simply using the words "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohanty said that "nobody will tell you the ingredients."
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers tested five brands of synthetic gum and five of natural gum, which use plant-based polymers such as tree sap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was surprising that we found microplastics were abundant in both," Lowe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gum shed almost all of the microplastics during the first eight minutes of chewing, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Jones, a researcher at the UK's University of Portsmouth not involved in the study, said manufacturers should be forced to give more specific ingredients than just "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones said he was surprised that the researchers found certain plastics not known to be in gum, suggesting they could have possibly come from another source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the overall findings were "not at all surprising", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  People tend to "freak out a little bit" when told that the building blocks of chewing gum were similar to what is found "in car tyres, plastic bags and bottles", Jones said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowe also warned about the plastic pollution from chewing gum – particularly when people "spit it out onto the sidewalk".
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, which has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but not yet published, was presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. (AFP)

<img alt="Zhang Jun, secretary general of the Boao Forum for Asia, says Asia will continue to see robust economic growth for this year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797323_1_20250325164614.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Equities diverged on Tuesday, as investors struggled to extend Wall Street's rally despite easing fears over US president Donald Trump's planned tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asian stocks fluctuated through the day, with Hong Kong sinking 2.3 percent to 23,344, weighed by a drop of around six percent in tech giant Xiaomi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi had raised US$5.5 billion in a mega share sale as it looked to expand its electric vehicle business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, which comes after a similar move this month by EV firm BYD, stoked worries about market liquidity. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Art Central fair is returning to Central Harbourfront from Wednesday with works from more than 100 galleries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Corey Andrew Barr, the fair director, said he expects a good turnout for the event, which features workshops, installations and art performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Last year we had over 40,000 people here and we expect to see something similar this year, if not greater,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark its 10th anniversary, the fair debuts the "Legend" gallery to highlight lesser-known artists from earlier generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the works on show is a collection by Japanese “rainbow artist” Ay-O as presented by Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So the Legend section is a new thing for us,” said Inessa Li, art adviser at Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the art fair, we are just very honored to participate in it and get more people to know this excellent talented artist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In partnership with the Tourism Board, the fair presents three artists who explored and created works inspired by Central and Sheung Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po neighborhoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can experience the creative process in a transformed art booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because they all have their own stories that are related to the neighbourhood through their artistic approach, we want to show what's the art related to the neighbourhood and what's the significance of Hong Kong's different areas,” said curator Shirky Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cornerstone art fair runs until Sunday.

<img alt="Daniela Klette is led away to a helicopter after a detention review hearing in Karlsruhe last March. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797316_1_20250325155616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former member of Germany's far-left Baader-Meinhof gang who was arrested last year after more than 30 years on the run will face trial on Tuesday for a series of armed robberies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Daniela Klette, 66, was part of the radical anti-capitalist group also known as the Red Army Faction, which carried out a series of bombings, kidnappings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was arrested in February 2024 at her Berlin flat, where police found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, explosives and large sums of cash, after apparently hiding there in plain sight for two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks earlier, the creators of a German "most wanted" podcast had stumbled across photos of Klette on Facebook attending capoeira classes in Berlin, though it is unclear whether this led to her arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial starting on Tuesday in the northern city of Celle relates to robberies Klette allegedly committed with two other gang members to finance their life on the run after the RAF disbanded in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  After she was detained, prosecutors also had Klette formally arrested on suspicion of involvement in three attacks in the 1990s, while the gang was still active.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named after two of its early leaders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, the Baader-Meinhof gang emerged out of the radical fringe of the 1960s student protest movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's members took up arms against what they saw as US imperialism and a "fascist" German state that was still riddled with former Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the height of its notoriety in 1977, the group shot dead a German bank chief and kidnapped and killed industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, a former SS officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the so-called German Autumn of 1977 marked the beginning of a long period of decline for the RAF, the group continued to operate for another two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette was part of a notorious trio – along with fellow gang members Ernst-Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg – who were active as part of the RAF's "third generation" in the 1980s and 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the RAF disbanded, Klette and the two men are believed to have financed their lives in hiding through armed robberies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for Staub and Garweg, who would now be 71 and 56 if they are still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial in Celle relates to four attacks on money transporters and nine cash heists from shops in which the suspects got away with a total of 2.7 million euros, according to prosecutors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette is said to have acted mainly as the getaway driver but also faces one charge of attempted murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said she carried a "realistic-looking" dummy bazooka during some of the heists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial is set to last around two years and will hear from 12 witnesses, according to the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette reportedly put up no resistance when she was arrested at her apartment in Berlin's bohemian Kreuzberg neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to German media reports, she had been using a fake Italian passport and going by the name of Claudia Ivone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neighbours told the Bild daily she had a partner about the same age as her and always said "hello" when she went out walking with her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette had no bank account and likely paid her rent in cash, possibly for several months or years at a time, according to Der Spiegel magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacks Klette is accused of committing in the 1990s, which are being dealt with in separate proceedings, include an attempted assault on a Deutsche Bank building in Eschborn, near Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is also accused of playing a role in a 1991 RAF attack on the US embassy in Bonn, which was the German capital at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third accusation relates to a 1993 explosives attack against a prison then still under construction in Germany's Hesse state. (AFP)

<img alt="The Unification Church's Tokyo headquarters in Shibuya. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797307_1_20250325151020.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church in Japan, upholding a government request for a revocation spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tokyo District Court’s revocation of the church’s legal status means it will lose its tax-exempt privilege and must liquidate its assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the church can still appeal the decision to higher courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order follows a request by Japan’s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into the 2022 assassination of Abe revealed decades of cozy ties between the South Korea-based church and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in 1968 amid an anti-communist movement supported by Abe’s grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan’s civil code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two earlier case involved criminal charges – the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy at Beijing's top office on Hong Kong affairs has called on the SAR to roll out a blueprint to further drive its capital market development, seizing on opportunities brought about by the revitalisation of the city's stock market this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Giant sinkhole swallows motorcyclist in Seoul

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person has been killed after a massive sinkhole opened up in Seoul, the fire department said on Tuesday, with harrowing video footage showing the moment his vehicle was swallowed by the hole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vast hole opened up at an intersection in the southeast of the South Korean capital during the evening rush hour around 6.30 pm on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage by a local lawmaker shows the hole appearing abruptly in the middle of a busy street, with a motorbike being swallowed up instantly as a car narrowly escapes the same fate, sliding into the hole before somehow bouncing out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department conducted a major search, with rescue workers wearing wetsuits and "digging with their hands" alongside a rescue dog, in a frantic 17-hour hunt for the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, on Tuesday "the missing person who is in his thirties, was discovered in cardiac arrest, approximately 50 metres from the centerline of the sinkhole," said Kim Chang-seop, an official from the Gangdong Fire Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was buried at a depth of approximately 90 centimeters and was found intact, still wearing his helmet and motorcycle boots," said Kim, adding they "regret that we are unable to deliver better news."
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver of the car suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole is now around 20 metres wide and 20 metres deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of schools nearby closed on Tuesday, citing safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the sinkhole will be investigated, but the accident occurred at a site where extension work for a metro line was underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul city official said it was clear the construction could have been one of "several possible contributing factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were several factors at play. Once the surrounding soil and debris are cleared, we will conduct a full investigation into the cause of the accident with a team of experts," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinkhole accidents are rare in South Korea, with fewer than 200 reported cases every year on average – significantly less than the number recorded in Japan. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land", Hamdan Ballal, was attacked by settlers and arrested by the Israeli army on Monday in the occupied West Bank, according to his co-director Yuval Abraham.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Abraham said a "group of settlers" had set upon Ballal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since," Abraham wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place in the southern West Bank village of Susiya, according to the anti-occupation NGO Center for Jewish Nonviolence, whose members said they filmed the events first-hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said it was verifying the information when questioned by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No Other Land", which was directed by Israeli-Palestinian activists, won best documentary at this year's Academy Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shot in nearby Masafer Yatta, the documentary follows a young Palestinian struggling with forced displacement as the Israeli army tears down his community's homes to make space for a firing zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Bank, excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, is home to around three million Palestinians as well as nearly half a million Israelis who live in settlements that are illegal under international law. (AFP)

    Tesla sales fall off a cliff in Europe

<img alt="A woman encourages people outside the Tesla Centre Park Royal in London to boycott the electric vehicle giant. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797297_1_20250325132757.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European sales of Tesla electric cars dropped 49 percent in January and February compared with the same period a year earlier, the ACEA manufacturers' association said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ageing models are one factor behind the plunge, but electric vehicle clients may also be refusing to buy in protest of Tesla's billionaire owner Elon Musk since he became a key supporter of US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has been leading a vocal and divisive cost-cutting drive at the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Tesla dealerships around the United States have been vandalised in recent weeks and the company's stock price has plummeted over the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year, giving the company a market share of just 1.1 percent, the ACEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February alone, Tesla registrations were down 47 percent at 11,743.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sales drop came even as overall electric vehicle sales jumped 28.4 percent over the first two months of this year to 255,489 – for an EU market share of 15.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries, "The latest new car registration figures confirm that market demand for battery electric vehicles remains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  She cited a need for tax and purchasing incentives for clients and investments in recharging stations, at a time when the EU is preparing to ease emission reduction targets for struggling European automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hybrid-electric vehicles continued to be the biggest market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations – for a 35.2 percent market share.
  <br>
  <br>
  That outpaced both petrol and diesel models, with market shares of 29.1 percent and 9.7 percent in February. (AFP)

    Non-urgent A&amp;E visits to cost more in fee revamp

<img alt="Health minister Lo Chung-mau (middle) says the fee reform is aimed at directing public resources to patients most in need. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797291_1_20250325131640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Non-urgent patients seeking help at the city's public accident and emergency wards are set to pay more than double the current rate as part of the government's revamp on healthcare charges, with the new fees taking effect over three phases starting on January 1, 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive reform will also see fee adjustments for other services, such as hospital stays and consultations at specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the administration is planning to cap charges at HK$10,000 for each patient every year. It also pledged to make it easier for eligible people to apply for a fee waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau said the fee reform was meant to offer more help for the underprivileged and those with severe illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the extra revenue - estimated at some HK$3 billion each year for the initial phase - will go back into public hospital services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, public A&E departments will charge patients depending on their condition, instead of the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical and emergency cases will be treated for free, while the rest will have to pay HK$400 per visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities are also introducing a "co-payment model" to charge patients between HK$50 and HK$500 for advanced and highly complicated pathology and non-urgent imaging tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But basic check-ups with high demand will remain free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fees for medicine from specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics will also be adjusted, while patients will be prescribed no more than four weeks' worth of drugs each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes are expected to lower the government's subsidy ratio for public hospital services from 97.6 percent to about 90 percent, which officials said remains a high level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Past experience showed that after this kind of structure review, a certain percentage of patients…they are more inclined to see alternative methods of care," said Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This enables us to have more capability to reserve our manpower resources to take care of the patients who really need emergency and accidents, and urgent care."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, the government will relax the income and asset requirements to qualify for a fee waiver. About 1.4 million people are expected to benefit after the tweak, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$10,000 annual fee cap, meanwhile, is estimated to help about 70,000 chronic or severely-ill patients who visit hospitals frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Chan, permanent secretary for health, is confident that the government is able to shoulder the financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is to provide another protection for all Hong Kong citizens who may or may not be eligible to apply for medical waivers, but we will assure them that under this public subsidisation reform, they would not be required to pay an amount that is unaffordable," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The $10,000 from our estimate is less than half of the median monthly household income. So we try to maintain it to an affordable level."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Health Bureau spokesperson said while the HK$10,000 ceiling applies to all patients, it will not kick in automatically and an application must be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  All surplus fees will be refunded once the application is approved, while subsequent charges for the remainder of that calendar year will be waived, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials aimed to complete the fee reform within five years, and conduct reviews every two years.

    Relief as billiards keep Tier A status
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China welcomes the government's decision to retain the sport's Tier A status, saying the impact would have been devastating had the sport been downgraded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Tuesday, Vincent Law said the retention announcement, made a day ago, comes as a relief to both athletes and coaches, as it allows them to focus on training.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he stressed that athletes would still face the pressure of having to perform well for the sport to retain the status in the next review, which will be held in two years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law pointed out that billiard has been an elite sport since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we had dropped to Tier B this year, our funding would have been cut by about 80 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if we just look at it from a funding standpoint, it would already have been a great loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But a more severe blow would be the billiards' sector having to quit the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There would no longer be a billiard sports department, meaning that our training facilities, coaches – as well as the support that players get, such as accommodation – would all go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the move to retain the sport's status will allow the public to get to know more about billiards, and he believes more children will also try out the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there are more venues in the SAR that allow us to stage competitions, that will also help promote the sport, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will increase from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute and a Sports Commission member, said he hopes the increment can offer more stable lifestyles for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said the commission took reference from the salaries given to management trainees at various organisations before coming up with the figure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cat and dog owners will soon be able to bring pets on board the light rail on weekends and public holidays once the MTR Corporation rolls out a HK$99 monthly pet pass from May as part of a trial scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, only guide dogs are allowed on trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-month pilot scheme will require owners to board the light rail with pets as long as they are kept in a bag that complies with luggage restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bags with a single side that exceeds 130 centimetres or having a total dimension of more than 170cm would not be allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Passengers also need to board or get off from a specific location of the train,” said Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the last train door of the light rail car.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Please stay within that area... so that we can also maintain a proper, comfortable environment for other passengers as well,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) advised owners to take extra care of their pets to minimise stimulation and stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to introduce the bag to the pet in advance,” said Lily Leung, senior behavioural support technician at SPCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the pet owner to do more introductory exercises at home so that your pet likes, or even loves, staying in the bag."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that a container with good ventilation and a size large enough for pets to turn around without restrictions is needed for a comfortable journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said owners should be alert for any signs of heatstroke in pets such as vomiting, panting and excessive drooling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said the scheme is aimed at promoting an inclusive community.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for pet owners and other passengers to be considerate of each other so the scheme can run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial period, it added, might be extended to collect more data, namely the number of pet passes sold, passenger behaviour and impact on the railway system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese authorities have released all employees of a US corporate due diligence firm detained in Beijing two years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The detained Beijing employees at Mintz Group, all Chinese nationals, have been freed, a company official said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of their release came on the heels of the just-concluded China Development Forum in Beijing attended by dozens of foreign chief executives, a platform that Chinese officials had used to bring home the message that China is open to foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful to the Chinese authorities that our former colleagues can now be home with their families," the Mintz official said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mintz has 12 offices around the world and more than 280 investigators, according to its website. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 In a first, M+ Museum is using artificial intelligence to transform its facade into a canvas celebrating Hong Kong's golden age of film during Art Basel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Night Charades" animation works like a fun guessing game, with the AI performing scenes for audiences to guess which films they reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created by Singaporean artist Ho Tzu-nyen, the installation features AI-generated characters performing scenes inspired by local cinema icons including Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told RTHK that he sees the project as a homage to the city's cinema heritage and a way to transform this legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's also a work in many ways dedicated to people across Asia who also grew up with these films and these images," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure we have many Hongkongers who know these films and who have their own memories connected to these films that Night Charades is a homage to," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the fourth year of collaboration between M+ and Art Basel, joining other public art installations across the city such as at Pacific Place and Starstreet Precinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take a lot of pride in having the only screen in Hong Kong of that size that is an exhibition space," said Silke Schmickl, lead curator of moving image with the museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here it's really an expansion of what all other commissions can offer. It is of course a high peak season in Hong Kong during Art Basel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The nighttime display runs from March 22 to June 29 at M+ Facade.

    De Minaur finds way through Fonseca fervor in Miami

<img alt="Alex de Minaur goes for an overhead drive in his Miami Open match against Joao Fonseca at Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797270_1_20250325105235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but de Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last," de Minaur said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in two hours and 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while," said Osaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3. (AFP)

    Boeing 'wants to bail out of 737 MAX guilty plea deal'

<img alt="Two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people have fuelled deep concern over Boeing's quality and manufacturing processes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797265_1_20250325103519.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing is seeking to withdraw an agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that blamed the company for deceiving regulators before two deadly crashes of 737 MAX jets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A US judge in December rejected the deal, faulting a diversity and inclusion provision, and Boeing and the Justice Department have been negotiating a new agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump took over on January 20, giving his administration a chance to weigh in on the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing declined comment. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes. The planemaker also agreed to pay a fine of up to US$487.2 million and spend US$455 million to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation as part of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019 and killed 346 people, have called the plea agreement a "sweetheart" deal that failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  An accepted plea deal would brand Boeing a convicted felon for conspiring to defraud the US Federal Aviation Administration about problematic software affecting the flight control systems in the planes that crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May, the Justice Department found Boeing had violated the terms of a 2021 agreement that had shielded it from prosecution over the crashes. Prosecutors then decided to criminally charge Boeing and negotiate the current plea deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision followed a January 5, 2024, in-flight blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines' jet that exposed ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas in 2023 said "Boeing's crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in US history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump administration officials have said regulators must be firm with Boeing after a series of missteps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to be tougher on Boeing. We need to be tougher on the industry," said Steve Bradbury, who was confirmed as deputy transportation secretary this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing on Friday won a contract to build the US Air Force's most sophisticated fighter jet yet. (Reuters)

 The Hang Seng Index lost 262.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to open at 23,643.32 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that the US President Donald Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  April 2 is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of "reciprocal" measures -- imposing tariffs on other countries equal to those in place against the United States. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

    UN cuts headcount in Gaza after worker dies

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said Monday it would “reduce its footprint” in Gaza after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds last week, killing one staff member from Bulgaria and wounding five other employees.
 <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the world body would temporarily remove about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers working in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to the increased danger after Israel relaunched its military campaign last week with bombardment that has since killed hundreds of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has also cut off all food, medicine, aid and other supplies to Gaza's population for the past three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric's statement was the UN's first to point the finger at Israel in the March 19 explosion at the UN guesthouse in central Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military repeated its denial that it was responsible for the strike, which took place a day after Israel shattered Gaza's two-month-old ceasefire with a surprise bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric said the UN had "taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the UN was “not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still had about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. (AP)

 South Korean auto giant Hyundai on Monday announced a multi-billion-dollar investment in the United States, including a new US$5.8 billion steel plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plant, which will be based in the US state of Louisiana, "will create 1,300 American jobs," Hyundai executive chairman Euisun Chung told reporters at a White House event alongside President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual capacity of 2.7 million tonnes, it is part of Hyundai's US$21 billion investment in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai's announcement makes it the latest firm to announce plans to invest billions of dollars into the United States since Trump's return to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has repeatedly threatened to impose painful tariffs on companies that do not relocate manufacturing jobs to the United States from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, domestic and foreign firms, including Apple and Oracle, have announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into US projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars are coming to this country at levels never seen before," Trump told reporters on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment was "a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hyundai will be producing steel in America and making its cars in America, and as a result, they'll not have to pay any tariffs," he added. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

    Procedural matters cloud first day of Depardieu trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tense first day of the trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu over sexual assault allegations ended on Monday, with both sides trading jabs on their approach to the legal procedure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu is on trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, in a case that placed one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this is the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer Jeremie Assous said the plaintiffs' refusal to conduct legal examination procedures, including a medical expertise, show that they "fear the truth, because once again, the truth is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer of one of the plaintiffs, said Depardieu's camp had been avoiding debate on the substance and is trying to prolong the legal process as much as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedural incidents that are stalling, those can cause stress among the victims," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial, expected to last at least two days, and possibly more, was initially due to be held in October but was postponed due to Depardieu's ill health. It will resume on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a 75,000-euro (US$81,000) fine. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan oil tariffs condemned as 'illegal'
   </title>

<img alt="An oil tanker near the Venezuelan port of La Salina. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797246_1_20250325082707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Tuesday called on the United States to stop interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs and abolish the "illegal" unilateral sanctions on the South American country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came soon after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas, a punitive measure that could hit China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest across-the-board 25 percent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed on Monday by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorised to determine if the levy will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries, and to the United States and Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters on Monday that the 25 percent tariff would be on top of existing rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, Venezuela exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, experts told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has dubbed April 2 "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deem unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  He earlier signaled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said on Monday it might take a narrower approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Monday announcement on Truth Social involving Venezuela, the president cited "numerous reasons" for what he called a "secondary tariff."
  <br>
  <br>
  He accused Venezuela of "purposefully and deceitfully" sending "undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals" to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in his post that "Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Trump's order, the 25 percent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Caracas said on Saturday it had reached agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately on Monday, the Trump administration extended US oil giant Chevron's deadline to halt its operations in Venezuela through May 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had been operating in Venezuela under a sanctions waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest move adds to tariffs he has vowed would start on or around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides reciprocal tariffs, he has promised sweeping sector-specific duties hitting imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  As things stand, however, his plans for the day might become more targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sector-specific tariffs "may or may not happen April 2," a White House official told AFP, adding that the situation is "still fluid."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official reaffirmed that reciprocal tariffs would take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump told reporters on Monday he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  He separately added that he would announce car tariffs "very shortly" and those on pharmaceuticals sometime down the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  US partners are furthering talks with Washington as deadlines loom, with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic heading to the country on Tuesday to meet his American counterparts -- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout gave financial markets a boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo last week that Washington would go to trading partners with an indication of where tariff levels and non-tariff barriers are.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stopped their practices, Bessent added, they could potentially avoid levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same interview, Bessent noted that levies would be focused on about 15 percent of countries who have trade imbalances with the United States, dubbing these a "dirty 15." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Monday as traders welcomed news that the administration of President Donald Trump may dial down upcoming tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told AFP the sector-specific levies "may or may not happen" as planned on April 2, adding that the situation was fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 percent to end trading at 42,583.32, and the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent to 5,767.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.3 percent to 18,188.59.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade news was "definitely the main cause" of the rise in Wall Street stocks, Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors clearly hate the idea of tariffs," he said. "So any news that implies that the burden of tariffs will be will be lighter than expected will be taken as a positive by the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Elon Musk's Tesla shot up 11.9 percent as traders piled back into the embattled stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  And United Airlines saw its share price jump 7.2 percent after announcing it was hiking fees on some credit cards and airline lounges. (AFP)

<img alt="Hours before those attacks started, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about the plan. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797229_1_20250325050810.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Trump administration officials, including US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, mistakenly included a journalist in a messaging group discussing strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis, according to a firsthand account by The Atlantic magazine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was inadvertently invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the "Houthi PC small group." In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a "tiger team" to coordinate US action against the Houthis.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15 over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he has warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before those attacks started, Hegseth posted operational details about the plan, "including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing," Goldberg said, declining to disclose the details of what he termed the "shockingly reckless" use of the Signal chat to coordinate the strike.

  , RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said the extent of the leak was astonishing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is absolutely breathtaking. It is jaw dropping. It breaches every single national security protocol that not only this government in the United States would traditionally follow, but that governments all over the world would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Marks said it was more likely a mistake rather than a deliberate leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It certainly appears to have been a monumental accident, but also it raises massive questions about how many more sensitive government national security conversations have been taking place across commercially available apps."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Defence Department referred a Reuters request for comment to the National Security Council, and NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security," Hughes said. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong's rising tennis star Coleman Wong on Monday fell short of a third round victory at this year's Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old fell to Australian Adam Walton, who won 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 in a match-up that lasted for two hours and 18 minutes at the Hard Rock Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong previously pulled off a stunning win of his own in Miami, beating American 13th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory provided him with a place in the third round of a Masters 1000 for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong – currently ranked 182th in the world – was the second-lowest ranked player to reach the Miami Open third round in 10 years.

 The Civil Aviation Department on Monday announced that local airlines will no longer let passengers use or recharge their portable chargers during flights, while storing power banks in the overhead compartments is also banned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new rules will come into effect on April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department said it is highly concerned about recent safety incidents linked to passengers using lithium battery power banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the decision was made after meeting representatives from local airlines last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Thursday, a Hong Kong Airlines flight en route to the SAR was forced to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou after a fire, believed to be triggered by a portable charging device, broke out in the cabin. In January, an Air Busan plane that was about to take off for Hong Kong went up in flames at Busan Airport after a charger caught fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<img alt="Sources say the fixed accident and emergency fee will be raised to no more than HK$400 from the current HK$180, with exemptions for critically ill and urgent patients.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say new fees for public hospital services will be rolled out in three phases starting as early as January next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fee at the accident and emergency unit will be raised from the current HK$180 to no more than HK$400, with exemptions for patients who need urgent care or are critically ill.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's expected that higher A&E charges will allocate more resources to treat the critically ill and reduce the number of non-urgent cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials hope the new fee system will be in place in five years, with reviews every two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources added that there will be a cap on inpatient and outpatient fees, likely set at HK$10,000 per person per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall funding rate for public healthcare will be maintained at 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reform aims to enhance patient protection, optimise the medical fee waiver mechanism to provide assistance to needy patients, and strengthen support for critical illness medications and equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources also said the Samaritan Fund could be relaxing its application requirements so middle-class patients facing severe illness who cannot afford expensive treatment costs could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau is set to announce the details on Tuesday.

    Billiards, tennis retain Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324223333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

    Cityline 'must explain Coldplay ticket errors'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary for culture, sports and tourism has called on the ticketing platform Cityline to explain misprints on Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the platform's website, the inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law pointed out that the platform has to apologise over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cityline must explain why it went wrong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's the platform that is in charge of receiving the instructions on how to print the tickets, what tickets were to be printed, as well as the matching afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, they have to explain it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that once the government learnt of the incident, it requested the platform make clear remedial and ticket-exchange arrangements swiftly to those who are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said Cityline and organisers need to have a contingency plan in place in the event that ticket holders do not manage to exchange the misprinted tickets in time for the concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will closely monitor the situation and make requests and provide guidance when necessary, she added.

    Thai PM set to survive no-confidence vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Monday faced a no-confidence motion in parliament as the opposition alleged she was being unduly influenced by her father, a former prime minister, and is mismanaging the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country’s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong is the leader of the People’s Party , a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home .
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn was also accused by Prawit Wongsuwan, head of the Palang Pracharath Party, Pheu Thai’s former coalition partner, of falsely declaring her assets, which she denied. (AP)

    Health officials to help pharmas register new drugs

<img alt="Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan, centre, hopes the new arrangements can speed up the registration of new drugs in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797180_1_20250324172745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pharmaceutical firms wishing to register new drugs in Hong Kong will soon be able to consult health officials before filing an actual application, saving both sides time and effort.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since November 2023, the Department of Health has made it easier for new drugs to be registered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Called the "1+" mechanism, pharmaceutical products would only need a single registration issued by an existing reference drug regulatory authority, down from two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initially open to drugs used to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, the rule was further extended last year to all new drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven new drugs have so far been registered under the regime, five of which have already been added to the Hospital Authority's formulary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that as of mid-March, it has received 400 enquiries from more than 110 pharmaceutical companies on drug registration matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  To better help the industry understand the regulatory requirements, it will launch a consultation service starting with an online briefing seminar next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan noted that some overseas or mainland firms are not familiar with the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not quite sure or quite understand our registration requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once they got the information, they may discuss with their company to see whether they want to go ahead with the applications...  so that we [don't have] to go back and forth to ask them to provide the supplementary information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will enhance our efficiency for the approval of the application," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department is planning to hold workshops in June and meet potential applicants face to face later in the year to further expedite the process.

    Heathrow 'had enough power to stay open on Friday'

<img alt="The National Grid's boss, John Pettigrew, says either of the two other substations could have supplied the power to keep Heathrow open on Friday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797178_1_20250324172618.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the UK's national grid has said there was "enough power" to keep Heathrow Airport running on Friday, after an electrical substation fire shuttered Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown, which lasted most of the day, affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised questions about the reliability of one of the UK's key pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the Financial Times on Sunday that power had remained available to the airport in west London through two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no lack of capacity from the substations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Losing a substation is a unique event – but there were two others available."
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport officials said the closure was due to the time it took to switch to the other substations and make safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted," a Heathrow Airport official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed so power supplies could be restructured from the two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials have said the blaze, which broke out on Thursday night, was "believed to be non-suspicious" and that enquiries would "focus on the electrical distribution equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Monday about the way airport bosses handled the events, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: "I'm not going to justify decisions that Heathrow leadership did or didn't take."  (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56 on a mixed day for equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.24 percent to end at 8,850.69, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.72 percent to end at 5,736.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equity markets were mixed as worries about fresh US tariffs pencilled in for next week were tempered by a report that Donald Trump was considering a more targeted approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has caused ructions on trading floors since resuming power in January by hitting out at long-standing allies and imposing or threatening swingeing tariffs on imports of an array of goods, including steel and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next Wednesday is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of reciprocal measures to counter those in other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anticipation and pre-positioning ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' on April 2 and the impending deluge of tariff-related announcements that will follow in the days/weeks after will be a growing factor that drives price action, sentiment and liquidity in markets this week," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the sky begins to bruise and darken, and the atmospheric pressure builds within the capital markets, market players question if it's time to batten down the hatches in preparation for a storm of uncertainty set to be unleashed on markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve last week warned that "uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased" while the central banks of Japan and Britain also warned about the impact of the White House's policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang said at the weekend that Beijing was readying for "shocks that exceed expectations" ahead of the latest measures, adding that "instability and uncertainty are on the upswing."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as he met heads of some of the world's biggest companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, FedEx and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was some hope among investors amid reports the US administration was considering a more targeted approach to the tariffs, with some countries being hit harder than others, and the measures not being as severe as initially feared.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after the president said on Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asian markets fluctuated through the day, with Tokyo falling along with Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai and Wellington joined Hong Kong in edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt opened on the front foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold held around US$3,025, having hit a series of records last week to a peak of more than $3,057 owing to a surge in demand for safe havens. (AFP/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Monday said it will implement a more proactive fiscal policy this year, with finance minister Lan Fo'an saying the nation's economic and fiscal strengths have grown significantly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the last day of the China Development Forum 2025, Lan said China has gained more experience in macroeconomic management and fiscal governance, and that confidence in the nation's economic development stems from solid fundamentals, numerous advantages, resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Lan said the primary task of this year's fiscal policy is to significantly boost consumption and enhance investment efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has the world's most promising super-sized market, with immense potential for consumption growth," Lan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to global business leaders attending the forum, Lan also emphasised that China will ensure equal treatment for all types of businesses and continue to improve the business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, senior executives of multinational giants attending the forum have highlighted the importance of strengthening global cooperation to ensure that industrial and supply chains can withstand unexpected external shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives told broadcaster CCTV that this meant that they have to come together across borders and industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide Corporation noted there is a tremendous supply chain for the elevator industry on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is our largest manufacturing location anywhere in the world. And so we take advantage of the supply chain here not just for China in China, but also in China for the world," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entrepreneurs, government officials, experts and business representatives from China and around the world attended the two-day forum – themed "Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global Economy".

<img alt="Different plans for temporary ceasefires in the Ukraine war have been proposed, but attacks have continued unabated. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797165_1_20250324162833.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials opened talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday on a partial ceasefire in the Ukraine war, a day after delegates from Washington and Kyiv had their own discussions.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and hopes talks in Riyadh could pave the way for a breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides have proposed different plans for temporary ceasefires, but cross-border attacks have meanwhile continued unabated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally planned to take place simultaneously to enable shuttle diplomacy – with the United States going back and forth between the delegations – the talks are now taking place one after the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting between the Ukrainian team, led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, and the Americans finished up late on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy," Umerov said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a "just and lasting peace" a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way for a "full-on" ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire," he told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are only at the beginning of this path," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there were many outstanding questions over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities said on Monday they would deploy dozens of helicopters and thousands of firefighters and soldiers as they struggle to control multiple wildfires in the southeast, which have been burning for days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been killed so far, with officials warning that high winds and rising temperatures were hindering efforts to put out the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Uiseong, nearly 7,000 hectares of land has been affected and around 600 people evacuated, said Lim Sang-seop, head of the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 57 wildfire fighting helicopters are to be deployed to extinguish the fire," he said, adding that more than 2,600 fire fighting personnel – including soldiers – would be mobilised "to respond with all their might."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire had been partly contained but was still burning as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in multiple locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A major wildfire claimed four lives over the weekend in Sancheong county, in South Gyeongsang province, about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire was also partly contained by Monday – but still burning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, citing "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated as acting president on Monday, visited the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, urging authorities to work together "until the wildfires are completely extinguished."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a truly heartbreaking incident," he said, adding that he would meet people affected by the fires later on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, urged authorities to "mobilise all means at their disposal to quickly and safely suppress the fires" and take further measures to prevent any additional wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other phenomena such as forest fires, droughts, snowstorms and tropical storms can result from a combination of complex factors. (AFP)

 China has not received any application for asylum from Philippines' former President Rodrigo Duterte and his family, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday.

  <br>
  Duterte's trip to Hong Kong was for his personal holidays, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press conference.

  The former president was arrested on March 11 at Manila's main airport on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of its probe into a "war on drugs" that defined his presidency. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires have hit several regions in western Japan, injuring at least two people, forcing dozens of residents to evacuate and damaging a number of homes as hundreds of firefighters battled the widening blazes in the mountainous areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires in the western towns of Okayama, Imabari and Aso broke out on Sunday, quickly burning hundreds of hectares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six homes have been damaged in city of Okayama, where a fire started on Mount Kaigara and burned 250 hectares of the forest. In Imabari, in the Ehime prefecture on the main island of Shikoku, the fire left a firefighter slightly injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and defense helicopters sprayed water but the blazes in the two prefectures had not been extinguished as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts blamed dry weather and dried-up fallen leaves on the ground in the forest as likely causes of the wildfires in Okayama and Imabari.
  <br>
  <br>
  A smaller fire was detected in the mountainous village of Aso in the Kumamoto prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu on Sunday, but it was extinguished early on Monday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. One person was injured slightly. Local media said the fire started while residents were burning trash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires came just weeks after extensive wildfires in the northern Japanese city of Ofunato left one person dead and damaged more than 200 houses and other buildings as the blaze burned 2,900 hectares, nearly one tenth of the land in the city. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)

    Appeal crunch time for Blatter and Platini

<img alt="Michael Platini, left, with Sepp Blatter in 2014. File Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797152_1_20250324151246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and France football great Michel Platini will appear before a Swiss court on Tuesday to hear whether the case that finished their careers in football will end with their acquittals or convictions for corruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, once among the most powerful figures in global football, will appear at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court two-and-a-half years after they were acquitted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiss federal prosecutors rejected the decision at a lower court from 2022, leading to the new hearing in the town of Muttenz, near Basel. Both men deny the charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case relates to a two million Swiss franc payment Blatter authorised for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, which was made in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini and Blatter said the payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because Fifa lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The affair, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer body Uefa, torpedoed his hopes of eventually succeeding Blatter at the top of Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini were suspended from football in 2015 by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years. Although their exclusions were later reduced, the ban ended their careers as senior football administrators. The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world soccer's ruling body to pay Platini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work. This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties," the indictment said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment was credible, while there were serious doubts about the prosecution's allegation the payment was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years until 2015, has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Now a frail 89-year-old, he said he was the victim of a witch-hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, a three-times European Footballer of the Year, insisted the money was related to backpay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no corruption, there's no swindling, there's nothing at all," he said at the start of the appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Dominic Nellen said the case was designed to stop Platini becoming Fifa president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Platini was the most likely successor to Blatter in 2015, but someone wanted him out of the way," Nellen said. "At every turn there seems to be an attempt to stop Platini becoming president of Fifa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter was eventually replaced by Gianni Infantino, who had worked for Platini at Uefa. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, Platini, was banned from football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino has denied helping to bring about Platini's downfall, and said he only stepped up when Uefa asked him after the allegations against Platini emerged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors want a sentence of 20 months in jail, suspended for two years for both Blatter and Platini, and to confiscate the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides can appeal against the judgement to the Swiss Federal Court, the country's highest legal authority. (Reuters)

    Venezuelans go home as US deportation flights resume

<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela on Monday received nearly 200 citizens deported from the United States via Honduras, as US President Donald Trump cracks down on undocumented foreigners.
 <br>
  <br>
  A plane carrying the deportees touched down early in the day at Maiquetia International Airport outside the capital Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we are receiving 199 compatriots," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live footage showed young men in sweatsuits walking off the plane. Some of them were seen smiling and clapping as officials looked on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes after Venezuela on Saturday announced it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriation flights from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest in a string of repatriations of Venezuelan migrants since US President Donald Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flights are resuming," Cabello said at the airport. "Trips have had little regularity, not because of Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to receive Venezuelans wherever they are," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deportation pipeline was suspended last month when Trump claimed Venezuela had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants, and Caracas subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then Washington deported 238 Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump has designated a foreign terrorist organisation, to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a move deeply criticised by Caracas. (AFP)

    Subsidy level for public healthcare 'unsustainable'

<img alt="Public Doctors' Association chairman Christopher Lung is calling for clear guidelines for frontline medics to handle future fee-related arguments with patients. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797138_2_20250324131612.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's no way Hong Kong's public healthcare system will be sustainable in the long term if the government continues to subsidise nearly all of the expenses, according to an adviser tasked with reforming the body managing the hospitals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is currently reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, with details to be announced by Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franklin Lam, who sits on the Hospital Authority's Governance and Structure Reform Committee, stressed the need for patients to shoulder more of their expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently the government covers more than 97 percent of public healthcare expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every HK$100 spent, the patient only pays around HK$2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the lowest in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, Lam pointed out that Singapore subsidises around 80 percent of healthcare costs for the underprivileged and less for those who earn more.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest budget in Hong Kong, healthcare expenditure for 2025/26 will reach HK$115 billion, a 5.6 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you divide that expenditure by the labour force of 3.8 million, each worker receives around HK$30,000 [in subsidies]," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public health expenditure is also 1.4 times the revenue from salaries' tax," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while fees and charges for public services could go up, he suggested it was "quite likely" there would be a cap for patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, there is annual cap of HK$10,000 for each patient...," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's about 2 percent of median family income.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would people decide not to see a doctor just because they have to spend HK$10,000? I don't think so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association also agreed on the need to adjust public hospital charges and called for understanding from all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the possible adjustments could come from the accident and emergency department, with patients triaged into less urgent categories paying more than the current flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Association chairman Christopher Lung said he hopes authorities can clearly explain the fee schedule to the public, while providing adequate guidelines for medics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Patients are triaged based on objective data such as symptoms and vital signs. But sometimes they are not satisfied and get into confrontations with frontline medics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lung also suggested the new fee levels align with those in the private sector so as to ease the strain on public hospitals.

    Govt to exceed family office target: treasury chief

<img alt="Christopher Hui says about one fourth of the new family offices had set up shop in the SAR partly due to the 'Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit.' Photo: Courtesy of Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797135_1_20250324130303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Monday he is confident that the government will be able to beat the target of bringing in over 200 large family offices by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The goal was set by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address in 2022 as part of measures to cement the city's status as a global wealth management hub by attracting investment and capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with a local newspaper, Hui noted that the government's investment promotion arm, InvestHK, has already assisted more than 160 family offices in setting up shop or expanding in the SAR and that another 150 are planning to follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While over 80 percent of the new family offices are from across the Taiwan Strait, others are from the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Americas and Oceania, he added, noting that the total number of new family offices could be much higher than the government data as some might have set up shop via other agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also noted that the authorities plan to turn the upcoming "Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit" into an annual flagship event as one fourth of the family offices that had set up here had done so partly due to the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third edition of the event is set to take place on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, more than 2,700 single family offices have chosen Hong Kong as their base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Hui noted that there are opportunities for growth in the city's family office business as global investors might "prioritise stability" amid the uncertain policy environment in the United States. He said the city provides a stable, sustainable and predictable business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government has introduced a bill to the Legislative Council to set up a "company relocation mechanism" to assist businesses in their relocations and that the legislative process of the bill could be completed in the first half.

    'Public flat tenants will have ample time to move out'

<img alt="The Housing Authority's Cleresa Wong expects at least a few hundred flats could be released after rules are tightened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797127_1_20250324121128.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority on Monday said well-off public housing tenants will be given sufficient time to move out of their flats once rules are tightened.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the new rules, some tenants will be required to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the standard rent starting from October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, if a tenant's income is between four to five times the limit after two declaration cycles, they will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairperson of the authority’s subsidised housing committee Cleresa Wong said she expects at least a few hundred flats to be released after the rules are tightened, but she offered assurances that tenants will not be forced to move out immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenants will only have to move out after they surrender their public flat and get another property," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't have to worry about moving and residing elsewhere temporarily, before being able to purchase a flat under the 'white form' status or a first-hand private housing unit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Lo Wai-kwok, who is also a member of the committee, said well-off public housing tenants would be able to afford the higher rents, adding that new policies can also encourage them to buy a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residential prices in the private market have gradually stabilised, and we have policies like the Home Ownership Scheme, and the 'green form' status. More tenants who can afford [it] may consider purchasing a flat," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estates Man Yu-ming, meanwhile, said it may be hard for some tenants to pay more rent, but he believes the changes could encourage upward mobility.

    Coldplay ticket fixes 'could be dealt with by post'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker suggested on Monday that the ticketing platform Cityline deal with exchanges necessitated by printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets by post.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets, according to Cityline's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of the seven ticket-exchange locations in Hong Kong, the platform has also added similar facilities in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  All booths will run from today until April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Yang Wing-kit noted that the two booths on the mainland are insufficient even though they are better than nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be people coming from the mainland, or even Southeast Asia to see the concerts. If you only set up booths in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, maybe people in Shanghai will have to spend a lot of time travelling to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to exchange their tickets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will be an inconvenience. Couldn't we come up with other ways, such as mailing the tickets by post? That would be much more convenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Cityline should come up with ways to compensate those who are affected, such as by waiving the handling fee and offering priority bookings in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exchanges could only be carried out in the SAR, before Cityline announced late on Saturday that booths would also be set up on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aryan Sethi, a local ticket holder, was among those who headed to the Tsim Sha Tsui booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was satisfied with the exchange arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've given us until April 7, which is at least one day before the show I booked for, so I think it's ok," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy they informed us as early as they could, instead of at least one week before, so I think it was ok."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people, meanwhile, told RTHK that they only found out about the ticketing error on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because they either did not get the email or only found it in the spam folder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will play at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 11am on Sunday, the Consumer Council has received 25 complaints over the incident.

    Local art space takes Art Basel on vampire adventure

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Want to see vampires travelling through time and space? Local art space Para Site is turning Art Basel's film section into a sci-fi wonderland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from tradition, the SAR’s premier art show has handed over its film programming reins to Para Site – marking the first time an organisation will be in charge of curating the section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're almost thinking of this programme like a film festival," said Para Site's executive director Billy Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's something about that gesture that is very collective and collaborative. So we really wanted to use that to mark the difference of our approach as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and three others curated the film programme themed "In Space, It's Always Night", which includes feature films, videos and moving images by 30 artists from around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centrepiece is "Vampires in Space" by Portuguese filmmaker Isadora Neves Marques, which tells the story of a family of vampires travelling through the cosmos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang told RTHK that he wants to bring new perspectives and create dialogue between local and international artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For an outsider, maybe people think a lot about Wong Kar-wai, and it's such a powerful legacy and becomes synonymous with the city," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we chose Isadora's film, we thought long and hard about that as well, because I think they represent a potential of something that could potentially in the future speak a lot about Hong Kong issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the videos in the programme titled "The Pixelated You" also features works by six Hong Kong-based artists, exploring the act of imagining others through imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the project aims to support the local art ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to think within the visibility of the art fair, how to channel that to focus on different communities that represent the city, how also it can draw attention to the wider city as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art enthusiasts can experience these otherworldly screenings at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from March 27 to 30.

 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan said on Monday that Hong Kong will continue to strive for carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the SAR’s multi-pronged plan to achieve this goal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a climate forum organised by the Environment and Ecology Bureau and University of Hong Kong, the minister said the city's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality have been bearing fruit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the building of coal-fired power plants in 1997 and have been gradually shifting to natural gas and nuclear power. Due to the efforts made, Hong Kong reached the carbon peak in 2014. Comparing to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about 30 percent of that of the United States and 60 percent of that of the European Union," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, the government announced its Climate Action Plan 2050 which outlined measures for the SAR to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  It consists of four major decarbonisation strategies, such as net zero electricity generation, green transport and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a new facility will be built to increase the proportion of zero carbon electricity to around 70 percent by 2035, along with an upgrade for the current cross-border electricity transmission infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  On transport, he said the government is expanding the city's electric vehicle charging network, and will stop selling private cars that run on gasoline or diesel by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong will stop using landfills to handle municipal waste by the same year to cut the eight percent carbon emission from waste disposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment minister also said Hong Kong’s first waste-to-energy incinerator facility will start operations by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy striker Moise Kean admitted his team "got distracted" after Germany's Jamal Musiala scored an easy goal into an empty net when absent-minded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his post during the Nations League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany saw off Italy 5-4 on aggregate following a 3-3 second-leg draw to reach the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich, who scored the first goal for Germany, played a key role in the bizarre second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kimmich, seeing the Italian keeper had drifted off his line, took a quickly-taken corner that was flicked into the empty net by Musiala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got distracted. It can happen to concede goals like that. We'll work better on it next time," said Kean who scored twice in the second half as Italy rallied from a 3-0 interval deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said the quick thinking was "world-class and unbelievably smart," and admitted "I didn't see it at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  One person who did see it was 15-year-old ballboy Noel Urbaniak who noticed that Donnarumma wasn't paying attention and quickly threw the ball to Kimmich.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very sharp, which isn't bad in a game like this, he did well," said Kimmich who autographed and presented a match ball to the teenager after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He'll get a free ticket to the next home game," promised German football federation Rudi Voller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never been a ballboy before, this is my first time, and it feels really good," Urbaniak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy coach Luciano Spalletti blasted his team's lack of maturity over the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that they take corners quickly and must not turn our backs," said Spalletti. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Monday welcomed last week's remarks from the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, who praised EuroCham's work in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong told a visiting EuroCham delegation to Beijing that Hong Kong had the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , EuroCham chairman Inaki Amate said the most important takeaway from the meeting was the central government's commitment to the long-term stability and prosperity of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had an opportunity to express our commitment to the Hong Kong SAR and to the measures that the Hong Kong and Chinese government are putting forward to ensure the long term stability that we need in the business community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amate also said the European Chamber of Commerce was working hard to encourage companies from Europe to set up operations in the city and contribute to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [firms] see that the potential of Hong Kong has not vanished. That there is still a lot that Hong Kong can offer to international firms in the way they can penetrate back into China but also can consider Hong Kong as a regional headquarters."

    Stocks open up amid caution over tariffs

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index opened 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, up at 23,749. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797110_1_20250324110326.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index climbed 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, to open at 23,749.58 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as financial markets made a mixed start with US stock futures rising but the dollar wavering ahead of a week driven by data, Chinese earnings and the threat of steep US tariff hikes on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures were up about 0.6 percent in the morning and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei climbed about 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The week holds global purchasing managers index gauges, the US Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading, inflation data in Australia and Japan, a budget update in Britain and major earnings in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is likely to be updates on US President Donald Trump's plans to for global reciprocal tariffs from April 2 that drives markets, and after a volatile month for stocks, bonds and currencies, analysts said there is no obvious trade ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to really devise a structural playbook," said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to put your mind into the head of the consumer and households," he said, since it has been fears of a slowdown in the world's biggest economy that has led to weeks of selling dollars and stocks and a strong rally for Treasuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anything that feeds into this higher probability of recession, higher probability of a stagflationary environment ... or that price pressures aren't transitory is where we start to get panicky a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to impose a complicated barrage of tariffs, the details of which are not clear save that they are to be calculated to reflect the impact of foreign tariffs as well as foreign value-added taxes on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong shares are up 18 percent so far this year, the largest gain of any major market, but a drop of 4.4 percent over two sessions late last week pointed to a pause in the flow of money while traders consider their, and Trump's, next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earnings at automaker BYD, video platform Kuaishou as well as Chinese banks and several property developers will be in focus. In the United States, discount retailer Dollar Tree and up-market athletic clothier Lululemon are on the calendar.

<img alt="Mirra Andreeva receives treatment from a WTA physiotherapist during an injury timeout in her Miami Open match against Amanda Anisimova at Hard Rock Stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva, coming off back-to-back WTA 1000 wins in Dubai and Indian Wells, exited in the third round, her 13-match winning streak ending with a three-sets loss to American Amanda Anisimova.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, the 11th seed, hoped to continue her rise up the rankings with a strong showing in Miami but appeared to be hampered by injury as she lost to 17th seeded Miami resident Anisimova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva received lengthy medical attention in her abdominal area when 2-1 down in the first set, which she lost 7-6 (7/5).
  <br>
  <br>
  She bounced back, dominating the second set 6-2 but Anisimova won the third set of the two hour and 49-minute battle 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anisimova will face Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, after the British player advanced when her American opponent McCartney Kessler retired injured in the second set of their encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year," said Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone," said Dimitrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils delighted his supporters defeating Spaniard Jaume Munar 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7/1). (AFP)

    S Korea court dismisses impeachment of prime minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court dismissed the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Monday, reinstating him as acting president – a role he was given after the president was suspended for declaring martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Han's impeachment was dismissed in a 5-1 vote by the court's eight justices. Two justices voted to reject the impeachment motion entirely," Yonhap reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court ruling is the latest development in South Korea's complex and sprawling political crisis, which was touched off by suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled parliament impeached Yoon's replacement Han just weeks after he assumed the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers cited Han's refusal to appoint more judges to the Constitutional Court – which will also decide on Yoon's impeachment – plus his purported role in the martial law debacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court only had six judges at the time, meaning that had even one judge refused to back impeachment, Yoon would have been reinstated. The opposition had called for three more to be appointed, taking the court up to a full bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to local broadcaster YTN, the court decision on Monday "explained that not certifying nominees is illegal, but not enough to warrant dismissal," in its decision to throw out Han's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  YTN also said that the court "found no evidence of [Han's] role" at meetings related to planning the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two additional judges to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who immediately resumed the acting presidency after the ruling, thanked the Constitutional Court for its "wise decision".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere. I think there is no place for division now. Our country's priority is to move forward," he added. (AFP)

    Mark Carney calls snap Canadian election

<img alt="Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the move at a news conference in Ottawa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797074_1_20250324055036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who "wants to break us so America can own us."
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the next election was not due until October 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal Party in the polls since January, when Trump began threatening Canada and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon being sworn in as prime minister on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty," Carney told reporters after the Governor General - the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state - approved his request for an election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carney's remarks.

  Trump on March 6 delayed a broad 25 percent tariff on some Canadian goods for 30 days. He has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and threatened reciprocal tariffs on additional goods, including Canadian dairy and lumber, on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The polling suggests that the number one concern that Canadians have right now is the potential negative fallout of Donald Trump and the threatened tariffs," said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist and founder of pollster Nanos Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney is "probably setting the groundwork for something a little more strident on April 2nd," Nanos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former two-time central banker with no previous political or election campaign experience, captured the Liberal leadership two weeks ago by persuading party members he was the best person to tackle Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he has five weeks to win over Canadians. On Sunday, Carney proposed cutting the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls suggest the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015 and badly trailed the official opposition Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We moved from an election where people wanted change to an election that's really much more about leadership," said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ability of the Conservatives to attack the Liberals has been greatly diminished, because people are focused on the here and now and the near-term future, not on what happened over the last 10 years," he said by phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conservatives have sought to portray Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. They also accuse him of being less than clear about how he transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney bristled last week when asked about the trust, and accused the reporter asking of engaging in "conflict and ill will". The prickly reaction could give hope to the Conservatives that Carney might stumble during what will be his first campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any victory will be a good performance in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. Carney had trouble at one press conference when asked to respond in French, first misunderstanding the question and then answering in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, speaks flawless French and is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need to do is put Canada first for a change," Poilievre said at a press conference on Sunday to launch his campaign, adding that his policies, including tax cuts and increased resource production, would bring back investment, helping Canada become more self-reliant and better equipped to stand up to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Western University in the Canadian city of London, said Carney's inexperience might not be that important given the Trump factor. "I have a feeling we're going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released last week put the Liberals on 42 percent public support and the Conservatives on 37 percent. Angus Reid said the margin of error was around 1.5 percent, 19 times out of 20. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leader Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a balanced scoring performance in a 120-91 victory at Utah.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jarrett Allen scored 18 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16 to lead six Cavaliers in double figures while Evan Mobley added 11 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a long season. We're going to go through some ups and downs, we're not going to play our best," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this streak had happened in November I don't think everybody would be tripping as much. This is all part of the season. It's all part of getting better. Won tonight. We've turned the corner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs, with the NBA's second-best record, improved to 57-14 after prior road trip losses at the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Phoenix, while the Jazz, with the NBA's second-worst record, fell to 16-56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland stretched the lead atop the East to five and a half games over defending NBA champion Boston but remain one and a half games behind Oklahoma City (58-12) for the NBA's best overall record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-0 run to open the second half lifted the Cavs ahead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got some stops and then got in transition and made some shots. That helped," Mitchell said. "This is a great win. Now we're got to continue to take care of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Filipowski led Utah with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Detroit, rookie forward Ronald Holland scored 26 points off the bench to lead the Pistons over visiting New Orleans 136-130.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Duren added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, which improved to 40-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons are two wins from their first winning season since 2016 as they seek a first playoff berth since 2019 and first playoff win since 2008.

<img alt="Mikel Oiarzabal opened the scoring for Spain in their second leg clash against the Netherlands. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797081_2_20250324074010.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Goalkeeper Mike Maignan saved twice in the shoot-out as France beat Croatia 5-4 on penalties after their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate, sealing a place in the last four in June.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus won 2-0 on the night with goals in normal time by Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembele at the Stade de France to wipe out their deficit from Thursday's first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  With no further scoring in extra time the tie went to penalties, where Maignan saved from both Martin Baturina and Josip Stanisic, while Franjo Ivanovic also missed his kick for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez both failed to convert for the hosts, but Dayot Upamecano scored when he became the seventh France player to step up, sparking scenes of celebrations on the pitch and in the crowd of 77,502.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who won the Nations League in 2021, will now take on title-holders Spain in the semi-finals in Germany on June 5, with the winners going through to the final three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile Croatia, who lost on penalties to Spain in the final of the last edition of the Nations League in 2023, will now start their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will go into qualifying Group L with the Czech Republic, Montenegro, the Faroe Islands and Gibraltar.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's progress to the final stages of the Nations League means they will not begin their World Cup qualifying campaign until September, when they will be in Group D with Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Nations League holders Spain reached the final four with a 5-4 win on penalties against the Netherlands, after a thrilling 3-3 quarter-final second leg draw had left the tie 5-5 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donyell Malen missed and Barcelona's Pedri slotted home to settle a gripping match in which the Netherlands came from behind three times to force the shoot-out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Oyarzabal opened the scoring for Spain but Memphis Depay levelled from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed Spain's second before Ian Maatsen rifled home to force extra-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal, who also missed a penalty in the shoot-out, scored a brilliant goal to put Spain ahead but Xavi Simons netted another spot-kick to force penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so nice to wear this shirt and to be able to score this goal," Pedri said, with his side facing France in the semi-finals. "We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Spain's struggles in Rotterdam on Thursday in the 2-2 first-leg draw, coach Luis de la Fuente made a handful of changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal and Dani Olmo came in for Alvaro Morata and Pedri, while Dean Huijsen made his first start, against the country of his birth, and excelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman brought in debutant Maatsen at left-back, giving him the unenviable challenge of shackling 17-year-old prodigy Yamal at Valencia's sold-out Mestalla stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's success in recent years has inspired their supporters and over 20,000 watched them train ahead of the second leg, which also served as a fundraiser for damage caused by the devastating storms which hit the Valencia region last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won a penalty early on when Jan Paul van Hecke clumsily brought down Oyarzabal, who scored the winning goal for La Roja in the Euro 2024 final last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Sociedad forward took it himself, smashing into the bottom right corner, past Bart Verbruggen's dive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal had a goal ruled out for offside and the Brighton goalkeeper denied Nico Williams with a superb stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 19, was jeered by the travelling Dutch fans, upset he did not choose to play for them, but Spain supporters backed him in response and he shone. (AFP)

    Filipino teenager Eala sends Keys packing in Miami

<img alt="Eala is the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since 1975. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797077_1_20250324055913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala, the 2022 U.S. Open girls' singles champion, who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growing up it was tough," Eala said in her on-court interview. "You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think – I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat – and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success," said the American.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break. (AFP)
