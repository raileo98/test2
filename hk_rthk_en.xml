<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."

    'Trump's speech has imperialistic overtures'

<img alt="Josef Gregory Mahoney says Donald Trump's inauguration speech had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788447_1_20250121101535.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international relations professor on Tuesday said Donald Trump’s inauguration speech had "sort of imperialistic overtures".
 <br>
  <br>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai made the remarks on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme as the newly-sworn in US president vowed to “take back” the Panama Canal and potentially rename the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and invoked a “manifest destiny” in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if there's sort of this parallel that Trump is creating with this old 18th century idea of the US controlling the Western Hemisphere, at least the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, in as much as he's made overtures towards Greenland, Canada in terms of imperialistic overtures, but also things related to Mexico and now the Panama Canal and then renaming potentially the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if he’s creating sort of parallel with China where you have China in the South China Sea, China in the American mind trying to impose its sort of manifest destiny in East Asia.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney also pointed out that Trump made a wise move by holding back on tariffs against China, as the implementation would have roiled the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we all realised that tariffs are lose-lose at this point, that's what almost every study has confirmed,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that the biggest losers of all are American consumers who end up paying essentially inflationary prices for products as much as they have to bear the costs of the tariffs. And the United States depends much more on products from China than vice versa.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Before taking office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised Beijing for violating Hong Kong’s autonomy, saying it was now  a “semi-autonomous entity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney believes the statement will spark concerns towards how Washington will treat the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, you know, raises the spectre about whether or not the United States will start to treat Hong Kong as being part of the mainland and how that could have implications for the special status that Hong Kong has vis-a-vis the United States in terms of financial regulations,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That remains something of serious concern that we'll have to continue to watch. On the one hand, Rubio has said that he's committed to Hong Kong autonomy, but if he's decided that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous, then that raises a whole different perspective.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong will strengthen cooperation with other places to try to secure the release of SAR residents being held prisoner in "scam farms" in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the moment, 10 Hongkongers are believed to be being forced to take part in fraud after being tricked into travelling to Thailand and neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday that authorities will carry out thorough investigations and work with counterparts overseas to tackle the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are a lot of players in the whole fight against this crime, including law enforcement agencies in the relevant countries. There are good networks already. The respective countries have already heightened their attention and escalated the government participation in our whole fight," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen cooperation in this area, passing intelligence across the players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on the public to be aware of different types of scams, including those that have ensnared scores of university students from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People may have heard about such cases...but still they think they won't be the victims and so they are not as alert," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have strengthened cooperation with tertiary institutions to raise awareness of financial scams among students, Lee added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said more than 1.4 million mainland arrivals are expected in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the administration will make comprehensive preparations to ensure travellers have a good experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inter-departmental working group, chaired by the chief secretary, will make proper arrangements based on the situation during individual festive periods and the estimated traveller numbers," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding cross-border arrangements, we need to discuss and cooperate with mainland authorities. We will look at the actual situation to see whether service hours at border checkpoints need to be extended and how long these should be. We should be announcing the details within this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said 2025 will open a new page for Hong Kong with more tourists making frequent visits to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of inbound visits saw a huge surge last year, reaching almost 45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  While mainland arrivals saw a 30 percent year-on-year increase, the growth from Southeast Asia was even more significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he expects the growth to continue in the coming year, with more new air routes to be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chief executive also announced that twin panda cubs at Ocean Park will make their public debut on February 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said there would be a naming contest for the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope everyone can share the joy of this big family, so having a naming contest will make it even more joyful and warm. Details will be announced soon," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan arrived in Davos, Switzerland on Monday for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting where he expressed his desire to expedite a free trade agreement between Hong Kong and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan met Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the council's secretary-general, to discuss strengthening bilateral trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FS said both parties acknowledged that the launch of the "Gulf Cooperation Council Chapter" at the Asian Financial Forum last week marked a significant step forward in strengthening financial services cooperation between Hong Kong and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government is committed to facilitating two-way business delegation visits to enhance collaboration in digital economy, green transformation, securities markets, Islamic finance, and asset and wealth management with Arab states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also met several finance and business leaders from Europe, America, the Middle East and Japan and promoted the SAR's advantages as a "super connector" and "super value-adder".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he briefed the leaders on Hong Kong's recent economic and social developments, highlighting progress in the local financial market last year and achievements in attracting businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised strategies to advance finance, innovation and technology, trade and aviation and create global opportunities for businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan met the chair of Revolut, a UK-based fintech company specialising in digital banking services, to discuss the latest developments in the field and to encourage the company to expand its operations in Hong Kong.

    Badosa stuns Gauff to reach Aussie Open semi-finals

<img alt="Badosa (R) greets Coco Gauff after her quarter-final victory in the Australian Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788455_1_20250121110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An "emotional" Paula Badosa shattered world number three Coco Gauff's dream of a first Australian Open title when she stunned her 7-5, 6-4 in the quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badosa reached a Slam semi-final for the first time in her career -- the first Spanish woman to do so since Garbine Muguruza at Melbourne in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a bit emotional," said Badosa, who will face either two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a very emotional person. I wanted to play my best game. I think I did it – I'm super proud of the level I gave today," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a remarkable comeback to tennis for the 11th seed, who was ranked outside the top 100 a year ago after a stress fracture in her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean, a year ago, I was here with my back that I didn't know if I had to retire from this sport, and now I'm here playing against the best in the world," said Badosa. "I won today. I'm in a semi final. So I would never think that a year after I would be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third seed Gauff had been unbeaten in nine matches this season, but dropped her first set of 2025 before recovering to beat Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa began aggressively and had the Gauff serve under pressure early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff was serving at 5-5 30-40 when the Spaniard got the breakthrough on her third break-point opportunity and served out to take the opener in 56 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American, uncharacteristically, failed to create any break points in the first set and littered her game with unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa was relentless at the start of the second set in a marathon first game that lasted for 14 minutes and went to eight deuces. Gauff saved four break points but a fifth proved costly as the American went long to drop her serve again.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rasping running forehand winner and a backhand at the net put Gauff on the board and fired her up as broke back to level at 2-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Badosa powered to another two breaks and secured the match in one hour and 43 minutes, falling to the court in celebration as she registered her first win over a top-10 opponent at a Grand Slam in four attempts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning NBA champion Boston Celtics crushed the Golden State Warriors 125-85 as current league leaders Cleveland romped past the Phoenix Suns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tatum scored 22 points with nine rebounds and seven assists before sitting out the entire fourth quarter of the Celtics' dominant victory in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and Jaylen Brown chipped in 17 for Boston, who took full advantage of the absence of Draymond Green, the latest Warriors injury victim after he strained his left calf on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are some of the tricky games in the NBA, when teams have some star players out, other guys get a different role," Tatum said. "We fell victim to that a couple of times this year, so we were just trying to lock in from the beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up by 15 at halftime, the Celtics erupted for 43 points in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Curry scored 18 points to lead the Warriors and Moses Moody added 13 off the bench – the only Golden State players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was just one of the lopsided results as the NBA marked the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday with a day-long slate of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to fuel the Cavaliers in a 118-92 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury absences of Evan Mobley, Isaac Okoro and Caris LeVert did nothing to slow the Cavs, who led by as many as 32 on the way to boosting their league-best record to 36-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing was this was a group effort," Mitchell said. "Everybody contributed at a high level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Durant scored 33 points with seven rebounds to lead the Suns, but Devin Booker – who had scored at least 30 points in the Suns' last five games – was held to 15 points on six-of-14 shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to help the Memphis Grizzlies rally from a 16-point deficit to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-106.
  <br>
  <br>
  Desmond Bane added 22 points and Ja Morant scored 19 for Memphis, who were still down by five going into the fourth quarter and took their first lead of the second half on Bane's floater in the lane with 3:21 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was ugly from the start, but we kept competing and found a way down the stretch," Bane said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 32 points to lead the Timberwolves, but missed a potential game-winning three-pointer as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, New York's Jalen Brunson scored 34 points to propel the Knicks to a 119-110 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 27 points, leading seven Hawks players to score in double figures, but Atlanta saw their three-game winning streak end.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte, LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges scored 23 points apiece as the Hornets used a balanced scoring effort to hold off Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks 110-105.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving scored 14 of his 33 points in the final frame and Daniel Gafford finished with a career-high 31 points and 15 rebounds, but with Luka Doncic still sidelined by a calf injury, the Mavericks lost for the fourth time in their last five games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's embattled Country Garden jumped as much as 11 per cent in resumed trade on Tuesday following a more than nine-month trading suspension to give time for the developer to prepare delayed financial statements for 2023 and 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a lawyer for Country Garden, once China's biggest developers, told a Hong Kong court that the company expected to reach terms with creditors next month regarding the restructuring of US$16.4 billion in offshore debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock had been suspended from trading since April 2 pending the publication of its 2023 full-year and 2024 interim financial reports after it defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong-based Country Garden has now been granted an adjournment until May 26 in a court hearing held to gauge the extent to which its debt restructuring is proceeding ahead of a decision on a liquidation petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Country Garden were up 11 per cent in early trade on Tuesday at HK$0.54, compared with its last trading price of HK$0.485 before the suspension in April. (Reuters)

    Trump pardons over 1,500 people for Jan 6 riots

<img alt="US President Donald Trump issues executive orders and pardons for January 6 defendants in the Oval Office at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788441_1_20250121095231.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, in a show of solidarity with supporters who stormed the seat of American power in his name.
 <br>
  <br>
  The far-reaching action also cuts short the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations, including some who were convicted of seditious conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also directs the US attorney general to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What they've done to these people is outrageous," Trump, a Republican, told reporters in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are the hostages - approximately 1,500 people - for a pardon, full pardon," he said at a signing ceremony shortly after arriving at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they come out tonight frankly," he said. "They're expecting it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, whose first term as president ended under the cloud of the Capitol assault, has repeatedly played down the unprecedented violence of January 6, even going so far as to describe it as a "day of love."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 race. He then encouraged the crowd to march on Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged by special counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the case never made it to trial, and was dropped under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest figures from the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, 1,583 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol siege, including 608 accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the former leader of the Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, said he expected his client to be released from federal prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tarrio is serving a 22-year sentence, the longest of anyone criminally charged in the riot, for seditious conspiracy. He was found guilty of plotting to violently oppose the transfer of power after the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for Tarrio's co-defendant, Joe Biggs, said he was also told by an intermediary that Biggs is being processed for release. Biggs, who held a senior post in the Proud Boys, was also convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 17 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Constitution gives presidents broad pardon power and there is no legal mechanism for challenging a presidential pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, before leaving office on Monday, issued pre-emptive pardons to former Covid pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, retired general Mark Milley and close family members to shield them from "politically-motivated prosecutions" by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden gave similar pardons to former Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney and other members of the congressional committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just minutes before Trump was sworn in, Biden announced he was issuing pardons to his brother James Biden, James's wife Sara Jones Biden, his sister Valerie Biden Owens, Valerie's husband John Owens, and his brother Francis Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me -- the worst kind of partisan politics," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end." (Agencies)

    Gusts, extreme fire weather return to LA

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windy and dry conditions returned to Southern California on Monday, raising the risk of new wildfires sparking as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area that started in similar weather nearly two weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gusts could peak at 113 kph along the coast and 160 kph in the mountains and foothills during extreme fire weather that is expected to last through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued a warning of a “particularly dangerous situation” for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon until Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities urged people not to mow their lawns to prevent sparking a fire, nor start any fires that could get out of control.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also asked residents to review their evacuation plans and ready emergency kits and be on the lookout for any new blazes and report them quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Acuna, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the biggest concerns are the Palisades and Eaton Fires breaking their containment lines and a new blaze starting.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Don’t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,” Acuna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on January 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades fire was 59 per cent contained on Monday and the Eaton fire 87 per cent contained, according to fire officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, who was sworn in as US president on Monday, has said he will be visiting the fire-ravaged areas at the end of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trip could include an awkward encounter with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has been the target of Trump's barbs over his handling of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of "excess rain and snow melt from the North."
  <br>
  <br>
  In reality, Los Angeles' water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins further east. (Agencies)

 A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous, rural area of Taiwan's south on Tuesday, according to China Earthquake Networks Centre (CENC), with reports of minor damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quake hit at 12:17am local time, with its epicentre at a depth of 14 km, the CENC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were felt in Taipei, lasting for over 10 seconds, and several aftershocks occurred after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of deaths from the quake, though rescuers were still assessing damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taiwan’s fire department said 15 people were sent to hospital for minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were six people, including one child, who were rescued from a collapsed house in Nanxi District in the city of Tainan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chipmaking giant TSMC said it evacuated workers from some of its central and southern factories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taiwan lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 900 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza on Monday, the United Nations said, exceeding the daily target outlined in the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Humanitarian aid continues to move into the Gaza Strip as part of a prepared surge to increase support to survivors," the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, 915 trucks crossed into Gaza, according to information received through engagement with Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout the conflict in Gaza, the UN has denounced obstacles restricting the flow and distribution of aid into the battered Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the day the ceasefire came into force, 630 trucks entered Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial 42-day truce between Israel and Hamas is meant to enable a surge of sorely needed aid for Gaza after 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement calls for 600 trucks to cross into Gaza per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hamas said on Monday it would next release hostages held in Gaza on Saturday, after an official with the Palestinian militant group had said they would be released a day later than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas is set to release more than 90 hostages over the coming weeks as part of the ceasefire deal. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City have announced the signing of Uzbekistan centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov from French club Lens for a reported fee of US$42 million plus add-ons.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov, the first player from Uzbekistan to join a Premier League club, has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at the Etihad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This squad is full of the best players in the world and I can't wait to meet them and play alongside them," said the 20-year-old, who has 18 international caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course Pep Guardiola is one of the greatest coaches ever and I am so excited to learn from him and improve my game even more," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a young defender, Abdukodir is already very intelligent, as well as being strong, aggressive and extremely quick," City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said. "Working with Pep will only make him better and, speaking to him, he is determined to keep improving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov's deal keeps him at the Etihad until the end of the 2028 to 2029 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City are fourth in the table after a 6-0 win at Ipswich on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signing gives Guardiola's team much-needed defensive reinforcement after an injury-hit season. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea overcame a howler from goalkeeper Robert Sánchez to beat relegation-threatened Wolves 3-1, ending a five-game winless run to climb back into the Premier League's top four.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's team were just two points behind leaders Liverpool in mid-December, raising hopes of an unlikely title challenge before losing their way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now they are back on track to qualify for next season's Champions League after second-half goals from Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke spared Sánchez's blushes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish goalkeeper had dropped the ball moments before half-time, allowing Matt Doherty to cancel out Tosin Adarabioyo's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca said Chelsea had dominated the first 40 minutes before problems that have haunted them in recent weeks returned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We lost a little bit of confidence, we conceded a goal and we started to struggle a little bit and then the second half I think we started quite well and then after the second and third goals the game was in control," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past five games we didn't win but I said many times that the performance was there," he added. "We created many chances, we didn't score and tonight finally we scored three goals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's top-scorer Cole Palmer, a doubt before the game, was fit to start as Maresca made five changes from last week's draw against Bournemouth including bringing in centre-back Trevoh Chalobah, recalled from his loan spell at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side dominated possession in the early stages and Palmer had a couple of early efforts, curling one wide and forcing José Sá into a diving save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were rewarded for their dominance midway through the first half when Adarabioyo fired home for his first Premier League goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defender controlled the ball well after it was deflected into his path from Reece James's shot from the edge of the box.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump vowed a new "golden age" as he took the oath for a historic second US presidential term on Monday, painting a picture of an America in decline that only his hardline policies can restore to glory.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an address in the US Capitol, the 47th president promised a blitz of orders including the declaration of a national emergency on the Mexican border and a policy of only recognizing two genders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also struck a nationalistic tone as he capped the most extraordinary comeback in US political history, pledging to impose trade tariffs, rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and take "back" the Panama Canal, which has been controlled by the Central American country since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The golden age of America begins right now. From this day forward our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world," Trump said in the Capitol, where the inauguration was held indoors for the first time in decades, due to freezing weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican even appeared to suggest he was on a divine mission, saying "I was saved by God to make America great again" after escaping an assassin's bullet at an election rally in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  While promising renewal, Trump denounced what he said had been a "betrayal" of Americans by a "radical and corrupt establishment" under outgoing President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "America's decline is over," said Trump, who at 78 is now the oldest president ever to take office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 82, who had earlier hosted Trump and his wife Melania at the White House for tea, watched on as his political rival read the last rites over his single term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's last acts in office included preemptive pardons of former officials and his own siblings to shield them from Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Trump and said on Monday he was open to talks on the Ukraine conflict. (AFP)

 Police on Monday said a worker died after falling from a ladder in Happy Valley.

    Donald Trump sworn in as 47th US president

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump was sworn in for a historic second term as US president on Monday, pledging a blitz of immediate orders on immigration and the US culture wars as he caps his extraordinary comeback.
 <br>
  <br>
  With one hand raised in the air, the 47th US president solemnly took the oath of office beneath the huge Rotunda of the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump and outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden had earlier travelled by motorcade together to the Capitol, where the ceremony was being held indoors - and with a much smaller crowd - for the first time in decades due to frigid weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, they and their spouses met for a traditional tea at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome home," Biden said to Trump as he and First Lady Jill Biden greeted their successors at the front door to the presidential residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, was a political outsider at his first inauguration in 2017 as the 45th president, but this time around he is surrounded by America's wealthy and powerful.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man, Elon Musk, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai all had prime seats in the Capitol alongside Trump's family and cabinet members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who bankrolled Trump's election campaign to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars and promotes far-right policies on the X social network, will lead a cost-cutting drive in the new administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump refused to attend Biden's 2021 inauguration after falsely claiming electoral fraud by the Democrat, this time Biden has been keen to restore the sense of tradition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden joined former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton at the Capitol. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush were there but ex-first lady Michelle Obama pointedly stayed away. (AFP)

 The Security Bureau said another Hong Kong resident suspected of being lured to Southeast Asia to engage in illegal work has been rescued.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said the Immigration Department's Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit earlier received a request for help from the family of the SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they immediately followed up and contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Office in Hong Kong, the Chinese Embassies in both Myanmar and Thailand and the Consulate General of Myanmar in Hong Kong for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dedicated unit of the Security Bureau is working to bring the individual back to Hong Kong as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood that the Hong Kong resident worked in a scam operation in Myanmar for four months before he was rescued and taken to a safe place in Thailand.

    New system to simplify land ownership transfer mooted

<img alt="The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788360_1_20250120191656.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is planning to implement title registration on land sold after 2027 to help streamline procedures relating to ownership transfer.
 <br>
  <br>
  It will also cover land granted by private treaty and by land exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a closed-door press briefing on Monday, Development Bureau officials said it's estimated that there will be around 450 new land grants, and 25,000 title registers will be created within five years after the new system is implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the current deeds registration system, title is decided by checking previous deeds, and officials said there is no guarantee of title to property.
  <br>
  <br>
  When conveyancing a property, the buyer’s lawyer has to check all previous title deeds carefully, including historical title documents, to make sure the property has a “clean title” so the buyer will have the legal ownership. Owners will also have to properly keep the title deeds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, officials said title registration will provide certainty in property ownership, and the person who is being registered will be recognised as the true owner.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Title Register is conclusive evidence of title to the property,” an official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau also said the new system can shorten the property-transfer process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no need to check historical title documents in sale and purchase of property. People will find out the owner from the Title Register on the Land Registry, and whether there are other ownership interests,” the official added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A genuine and innocent buyer who has acquired the property will have the “indefeasible title”, even if the transfer of property involved third-party fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, the former owner can apply for compensation, capped at HK$50 million, under a Land Title Indemnity Fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that it does not have a timetable on converting the existing 2.9 million land registers to title registration, due to complicated legal issues such as problematic ownership.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The outgoing chairman of the Bar Association, Victor Dawes, said on Monday that while protecting national security is fundamentally important and helps to ensure Hong Kong's economic development, the authorities need to exercise their powers in a proportionate manner.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his speech at a ceremony marking the start of the Legal Year, Dawes said common law and the judicial system are pivotal to the success of Hong Kong and the constitutional order in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited Lord Hodge, deputy president of the United Kingdom's top court, as saying that the quality of a place's legal institutions is important to investment levels, innovation and economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawes said there is no doubt that protecting national security is fundamentally important and essential for economic prosperity and people's well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there continued to be unfair criticism overseas regarding security matters linked to incidents that took place in Hong Kong in 2019, and some of the criticism was aimed at undermining the SAR's prosperity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bar Association chief said it's important for the authorities to exercise powers derived from national security laws in a considered and proportionate manner, to show that Hong Kong, as a jurisdiction, respects the rights of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ministers and public officers at all levels must be able to show that their powers are exercised in good faith, fairly, and for the purpose for which the powers are conferred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses must have the confidence that they will be dealt with on a principled and not an arbitrary basis. In this regard, powers under our new national security legislation should be used in a considered and proportionate manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Law Society, Roden Tong, said his organisation will do its best to preserve the legal sector's self-regulatory regime, saying this is seen as an important part of the profession's independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The independence of the profession will give the public confidence that it can take an objective view and effectively uphold the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is particularly important when our systems are under close scrutiny in the geopolitical climate, and the Law Society will strive to preserve the profession's self-regulatory status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong also called on the sector to play a bigger educational role to help tackle misinformation.

    Paul Lam slams 'efforts to exert pressure' on judges

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday hit out at attempts to "exert improper pressure" on overseas judges serving on Hong Kong's top court.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the beginning of the Legal Year, he also said people should not overlook the fact that some foreign non-permanent judges (NPJs) have decided to stay on the bench at the Court of Final Appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the court. There are now 10 NPJs, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the "participation of eminent foreign judges" in the work of the top court benefits both the SAR and the common law world as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's most regrettable that there were attempts mainly from overseas to exert improper pressures on foreign judges to dissociate themselves from the Hong Kong court. These attempts pose a threat to not only the rule of law in Hong Kong but also the development of common law in general," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is in full support of the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign NPJs in future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also criticised individuals who "intimidate" national security judges or "interfere" with judicial proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's vital to bear in mind that the enforcement of the national security law is subject to the supervision of the Hong Kong court exercising its independent judicial power," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anyone who intimidates judges handling national security cases or interferes with the relevant judicial proceedings in whatsoever manner cannot be genuinely concerned about the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the homegrown national security law, which took effect in March last year, aims to ensure "the hard-won peace and stability" that Hong Kong enjoys can be preserved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless security is first safeguarded, it will be impossible for Hong Kong to utilise its unique strengths at full strength under the principle of One Country, Two Systems, and serve as an international financial, shipping and trade centre," Lam said.

<img alt="Police stand guard at an entrance of Civil and Criminal Court during the verdict for the case of the rape and murder of an Indian doctor in Kolkata. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788348_1_20250120180810.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The rapist and murderer of an Indian doctor was sentenced to life in prison on Monday, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and widespread hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her weeping family had called for the convicted killer to be hanged and said they were "shocked" at the sentence, for a case that highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Judge Anirban Das said the case did not deserve the death penalty as it was not "the rarest of the rare cases", and ordered that Sanjoy Roy must spend his life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the 31-year-old doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata in August 2024 sparked outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The murder led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court last year ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of Roy, who pleaded not guilty and repeatedly insisted on his innocence was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system.

  <br>
  The victim's mother, who was seated close to Roy when he was convicted on Saturday, has said the family wanted him to be hanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are shocked by the verdict", the victim's father told AFP, tears running down his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our fight, and won't let investigations stop... Come what may, we will fight for justice." (AFP)

    Legal principles upheld in all cases: chief justice

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's judges have upheld fundamental legal principles in hearing all cases, including national security trials, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the start of the Legal Year, the SAR's top judge said the city's national security laws have brought with them "cases that attract heightened attention", particularly due to their political sensitivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung stressed the same legal principles apply in national security cases as in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presumption of innocence, the requirement that guilt be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the right to a fair trial are all essential safeguards that remain firmly in place," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our courts do not merely pay lip service to these fundamental principles. Judges at all levels are expected to, and indeed do, adhere to them in the adjudication of cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said tensions often exist between protecting basic rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the judiciary is firmly committed to upholding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Striking the right balance can be challenging, and outcomes in individual cases may be contentious at times, nor is the interpretation or application of newly enacted statutory provisions always straightforward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, it is one thing to disagree with a legal provision or a court decision in applying it, but entirely another to suggest that the justice system has been undermined by political expectations or societal atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after the ceremony, Cheung said the city's judges faced threats, and stressed that judicial officers should not be interfered with by any countries, bodies or organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Threatening sanctions against judges simply doing their work goes directly to the question of judicial independence and interfering with judges' work and therefore it is objectionable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is objectionable as a matter of principle and it is a direct affront to the rule of law and to judicial independence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief justice also said while the departure of foreign judges from the city's top court "caused concerns in some quarters", it has not affected judicial independence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunate that a few of these judges have felt unable to continue their service. They are, of course, entitled to their views, and their decisions ought to be respected. However, their premature departures do not mean a weakening of the quality or independence of the judiciary," Cheung said in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is true that, given the current geopolitical headwinds, recruiting overseas judges with the right stature and experience may be less straightforward than it once was. After all, overseas judges are appointed to our highest court on account of their acknowledged eminence and legal expertise, not merely to sustain the system of overseas judges for its own sake."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, five foreign judges decided to step down from the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Following their exits, there are 10 non-permanent judges (NPJs) left sitting on the top court, six of them from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments made to the media, Cheung expressed confidence that the city will be able to recruit more overseas judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the rather stable number of appeals heard by the CFA in recent years, the number of 10 NPJs – six overseas NPJs, plus four local NPJs – plus possible appointment of further NPJs in the future, would be more than sufficient to allow us to cope with our very steady workload on the court," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm reasonably confident of keeping our existing NPJs as well as recruiting new NPJs in the future when we can identify suitable candidates to be appointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The top judge also said the presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of Hong Kong's judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said the city has faced significant political, social and economic challenges in recent years, which tested the resilience of the territory's legal system and the strengths of its institutions. Despite that, he said, the judiciary continued to uphold the rule of law and ensured that legal procedures remain transparent, fair and independent.

    'Digital signage users need to up cyber security'

<img alt="HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases. Photo courtesy of HKCERT" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788324_2_20250120210646.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) on Monday urged organisations using digital signage devices to enhance security measures and review best practices to protect against potential cyber attacks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, the spokesman for HKCERT, said the use of digital signboards has increased significantly to engage customer interactions through digital advertising and public information, but warns that its growth comes with potential cyber risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT conducted a survey of 624 organisations across various industries, including retail, tourism and financial services and found that almost 40 percent of the companies they surveyed did not conduct risk assessments for their signages in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre identified various vulnerabilities that require urgent remediation among digital signage usage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Someone uses a USB device that includes malicious content or also can
  <br>
  include some script, when they insert it into a digital signage with the USB port exposed, they can quickly replace the content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the infrared, it's another channel apart from the USB port the attacker can leverage, they can based on some infrared advice to emit some orders or instructions to the digital signage so that they would also, under the other malicious command, change the content of the digital signage."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some digital signage systems also utilise weak encryption methods, which could potentially allow to hackers intercept, control or obtain network information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said companies need to increase their awareness and conduct the security measures recommended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Physically, they block the USB port, they stop the USB port autoplay functions, the infrared services, or maybe use a very strong username password for the content management system, or use a stronger encryption protocol so that it's not easy to eavesdrop on the content sent between the user computer, the Wi-Fi network, the content management system, and the digital signage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKCERT said it handled over 12,000 security incidents in 2024, with phishing accounting for over half of all cases, marking a 108 percent increase from the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan highlighted that looking ahead this year, supply chain security and AI content hijacking will become the primary cyber security risks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Organisations and individuals must prepare by implementing appropriate cyber incident response measures, deploying suitable cyber security measures, conducting regular security audits and penetration testing, and understanding and preventing relevant risks," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained stable in the final three months of last year at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the previous figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate was also unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total employment increased by about 7,100 to 3,718,900, while the labour force barely changed at 3,831,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of unemployed people fell by around 6,100 to 113,600, while the number of underemployed individuals dropped by about 1,800 to 43,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the overall jobless rate remained low and there were improvements in the manufacturing, financing, social work, arts, entertainment and recreation sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though the employment situation in some sectors might be more affected by the increased uncertainties in the global environment," he added.

    Bitcoin reaches new record on Trump comeback

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high, trading above US$109,000 on Monday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788326_1_20250120170729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin hit a record high above US$109,000 on Monday as Donald Trump, who has signalled plans to deregulate the cryptocurrency sector, prepares to be sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin surged to reach an all-time peak of US$109,241 ahead of Trump's inauguration ceremony, before falling back to US$107,765.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared since Trump won the presidential election in November, with bitcoin surpassing US$100,000 for the first time in early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after he nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the new president will deregulate the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having once branded cryptocurrencies a "scam", Trump changed his stance and was a major advocate of them during his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, he launched his own cryptocurrency, appropriately called $TRUMP, sparking feverish buying that sent its market capitalisation soaring to several billion dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  When bitcoin reached the landmark US$100,000 level, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! US$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was pitched as a way to break free of mainstream financial institutions by establishing a decentralised platform for transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency is created -- or "mined" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on a meddle-proof register known as the blockchain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has long been criticised for being the currency of choice for making untraceable payments on the so-called dark web, a hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The asset has often come under attack for facilitating money laundering and allowing extortion through ransomware attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its carbon footprint has also come under scrutiny because mining cryptocurrencies requires huge amounts of energy. (AFP)

    Call for more parties to cover losses of scam victims

<img alt="Lawmaker Johnny Ng (right) said the establishment of the “Fraud Loss Responsibility Framework” would encourage different parties to combat fraud more proactively. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788309_1_20250120154218.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Johnny Ng on Monday called on the government to set up a mechanism to share the burden of fraud to better protect scamming victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng, who is also the convenor of the "Anti-Scam Alliance", said the establishment of a "Fraud Loss Responsibility Framework" would encourage financial institutions, telecommunication providers, and digital platforms to take a more proactive approach in combating fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this would require these stakeholders to compensate the victim according to their degree of negligence in each case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last September, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched an industry consultation exercise on introducing a "responsibility framework" among commercial banks, in which banks would have to share losses with those who fall victim to scams that involve the customer losing money by providing their personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also suggested the establishment of an independent committee to handle disputes case by case, and determine how much percentage of losses each party should take up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays, we do not have any mechanism or organisations to help the victims to get back the money. I think this framework is to help them [victims] to recoup some money from some organisation or parties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that various loopholes were present even with increased protections towards citizens against scam, such as real-name registration when purchasing prepaid sim cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers can [now] easily advertise on social networks. [Many] citizens can see advertisements such as big discounts on air tickets, and they will click in and drop into a phishing or fraud website, and lose their money," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The banking system can also do more on suspected transactions. We see a lot of cases with [criminals] using overseas bank accounts and credit cards to debit the victim's cards in foreign exchange," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also questioned why scamming syndicates can acquire a huge number of sim cards to contact potential victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the government could look at other countries and regions, such as Singapore, which adopted a shared-responsibilities framework since the end of last year to combat phishing crimes, while Australia is considering the inclusion of social media firms in the sharing of fraud losses.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Monday executed a man who killed 35 people in a car rampage in Zhuhai last November, state media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A court in the city "executed Fan Weiqiu in accordance with the execution order issued by the Supreme People's Court", state broadcaster CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media said that Zhuhai's public prosecutor "sent personnel to supervise (the execution) in accordance with the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 11, 62-year-old Fan drove a small SUV through crowds of people exercising outside a sports complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  He killed 35 and wounded 43, state media reported at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was detained at the scene with self-inflicted knife wounds and fell into a coma, police said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to death last month, with a court saying his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society." (AFP/Xinhua)

 The government department responsible for attracting foreign investment on Monday expressed optimism that American companies will continue to be attracted to set up shop in Hong Kong after Donald Trump begins his second term in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said of the record 539 non-local companies it helped establish or expand in the SAR last year, US firms were the second biggest group, following those from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's director-general, Alpha Lau, said while it remains to be seen what the incoming US administration's policies will be, companies from many American industries will still come to Hong Kong in search of profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because in the end, American companies are very pragmatic, as well as very practical. And the growth is in Asia, and in mainland China," she told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if they want to look for business opportunities and look for growth, then this is where they want to be."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said Hong Kong is seen as a testing ground or springboard for foreign companies seeking to enter the mainland market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general expressed optimism that her department can meet the government target of attracting 1,130 companies to the SAR in the three-year period ending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firms last year created more than 6,800 jobs in Hong Kong, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion, around 10 percent more than in 2023, InvestHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top five sectors were innovation technology, finance, family offices, tourism and professional services.

    Country Garden on track to agree terms with creditors

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property giant Country Garden, which previously defaulted on its debt repayment obligations, expects to reach agreeable terms with creditors next month, the firm's lawyer told a Hong Kong court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Kingboard Holdings, filed a petition against Country Garden in February last year for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. (Reuters)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen scored two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills punished a slew of mistakes to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 27-25 and set up a blockbuster NFL playoff clash with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bills quarterback Allen barged over for two first-half rushing touchdowns at a snowy Highmark Stadium in New York as the Baltimore opposite number Lamar Jackson and the Ravens were left ruing a string of costly errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors had a golden chance to tie the game with less than two minutes remaining, but tight end Mark Andrews fluffed a simple catch attempting a two-point conversion to effectively seal the Bills win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How about that Buffalo Bills defence?" Allen said afterwards. "All year we heard this team has no talent, we're too small, we can't stop the run? We're not good enough to compete?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just put our head down and worked hard," he added. "I'm so proud of our defence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFC divisional round battle had been hyped as a duel between two of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the NFL, pitting this season's Most Valuable Player front-runner Allen against the Ravens' reigning MVP Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the quarterback shoot-out largely failed to materialise in a gritty contest that ultimately pivoted on the Ravens' mistakes at key times. A Jackson fumble following a sack by Damar Hamlin led to Allen's opening touchdown in the second quarter that put the Bills 14-7 ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen then scored his second rushing touchdown in the closing moments of the first half to help put the Bills 21-10 up at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens threatened a comeback with a field goal and a Derrick Henry touchdown in the third quarter that cut the Bills lead to three points. But another Ravens turnover in the fourth quarter, Andrews fumbling under pressure led to a Bills field goal that stretched the hosts lead to 27-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore hit back with a superb Isaiah Likely touchdown from Jackson's 24-yard bullet pass, but with overtime looming, Andrews botched the two-point conversion attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills will now meet Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City in next week's AFC Championship game, with the winner advancing to the February 9 Super Bowl in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the latest instalment of a fierce rivalry between the two teams, who have met three times in the playoffs since 2021 – the Chiefs winning them all. The Bills, however, were one of only two teams to beat the Chiefs in the regular season this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to enjoy this tonight and then turn our attention to the Chiefs tomorrow," said Allen. "They're the perennial of what you want to be in the NFL – you've got to beat them to get past them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, running back sensation Saquon Barkley rushed for two long-range solo touchdowns as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Los Angeles Rams 28-22 to reach the NFC Championship game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles will host NFC East divisional rivals the Washington Commanders next week for a place in the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia's power in the running game proved decisive in a game played in heavy snow with Barkley, a candidate for the league's Most Valuable Player, putting up 205 yards on 26 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the snow began to fall late in the first quarter, the Eagles exposed the Rams' run defence, opening the scoring on the opening drive of the game when quarterback Jalen Hurts broke out and sprinted 44 yards for the touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams fought back quickly though with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading a 13-play, 67-yard drive which ended with a four-yard touchdown pass to tight-end Tyler Higbee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles had spent all week preparing for the threat of Barkley, but they were still unable to stop him when he found a gap and sprinted 62 yards to put the Eagles up 13-7 at the end of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles extended their lead with two field goals in the fourth before Barkley turned on the turbo chargers again with just over four minutes left, with the snow showing no obstacle to his power and speed as he burst 78 yards for his second touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams threatened a remarkable comeback with a quick Colby Parkinson touchdown, but a last gasp drive for a go-ahead touchdown faltered. (AFP)

    'Set up scam-reporting hotline at universities'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker has proposed that the student affairs offices of universities set up scam-reporting hotlines to better protect students from falling prey to swindles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong and City University have asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible, after dozens reported being conned online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Chow Man-kong said these anti-scam offices should reach out to the police once students report they have been swindled.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that anti-scam education was crucial in raising their awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland students, in particular, they are not familiar with everything in Hong Kong, or they might not have anyone to rely on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under such situations, when there's an incoming phone call pointing out their identities and personal information, they will fall prey very easily."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campus TV - HKU's student news outlet - has reported that students who fail to complete the quizzes by February's deadline will be barred from certain facilities, including the library.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who is also the chairman of Legco's panel on education, welcomed HKU's decision to roll out the quiz, adding the university's intention was good.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Johnny Ng, told the same programme the quizzes were relatively easy, noting that questions for similar tests on the mainland were harder.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said that anti-scam quizzes are necessary, as fraudsters are rampant.

    Trump vows to end 'American decline'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally the day before his inauguration as Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk gestures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788274_1_20250120110649.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump pledged a blitz of presidential actions to end "American decline," telling a fired-up inauguration eve rally on Sunday he would crack down on woke ideology and immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a raucous campaign-style gathering in Washington, the 78-year-old Republican promised cheering supporters that he would act with "historic speed" from day one of his White House comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity," Trump told a packed sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was joined on stage by Elon Musk -- the tech tycoon who will lead a major cost-cutting drive in his administration -- and who vowed to make America strong "for centuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Then at the end the rally Trump danced alongside the disco band Village People as they performed their 1970s hit "YMCA" which became the unofficial anthem of his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Trump's hour-long speech focused on immigration, driving home one of the dark messages that helped spur his remarkable victory in November's presidential election over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to stop the invasion of our borders," added Trump, who has pledged to launch raids targeting undocumented migrants within days of taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Trump effect" has already been on display, with TikTok crediting his "clarity" for being able to restore service in the United States after briefly going dark due to a ban on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to save TikTok," Trump told the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised "lots" of executive orders from his first day back in the Oval Office, including one to ban "transgender insanity" and critical race theory from schools and to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also reiterated a promise to release files on the assassinations of former president John F Kennedy, his brother Bobby Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of Trump supporters formed outside the arena despite snowy conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the future US commander-in-chief paid a highly symbolic visit to Arlington National Cemetery, the resting place of America's war dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, followed by Vice President-elect JD Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sombre ceremony contrasted with Trump's last trip to the cemetery as a presidential candidate in August, when the US army criticised his staff for pushing a cemetery employee.

  But Trump's hopes for a huge crowd to see his inauguration at the US Capitol on Monday took a blow, however, when forecasts of below freezing weather prompted organisers to move the ceremony indoors.

  Instead of being sworn in on the steps of the Capitol, Trump will now take the oath under the massive dome of its Rotunda, last used for the ceremony 40 years ago during the inauguration of Ronald Reagan. (AFP)

<img alt="Mbappé celebrates after scoring Real Madrid's first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788254_1_20250120081151.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck twice and produced a brilliant performance to power Real Madrid to a 4-1 win over Las Palmas and take the reigning champions top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos enjoyed a perfect weekend, overtaking Atlético Madrid by two points after their neighbours slipped up with a shock defeat at Leganes on Saturday, while Barcelona, third, could only draw at Getafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has hit top form in recent weeks after an inconsistent start to life at Real Madrid following his dream switch from Paris Saint-Germain last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old reached 12 league goals with his brace, becoming the Spanish league's second top-scorer behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski, with Brahim Díaz and Rodrygo Goes also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very important game because we knew what had happened yesterday, with Atletico and Barca, we wanted to win and we did," Mbappé said. "We started badly, letting in a goal so early – but the reaction was top."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got the ball forward, quickly, attacking the spaces and with quality, we scored a lot of goals," he added. "We're happy because we're leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has 18 goals for the season in 30 appearances across all competitions, and is looking increasingly crucial for his side in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinicius Junior suspended, the spotlight was on the French forward at the Santiago Bernabeu and he delivered with a sparkling performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy, I have adapted to the team and I can play how I want, with my team-mates, with personality," continued Mbappé. "I think that we are all enjoying it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were thrashed by Barcelona last week in the Spanish Super Cup final, leading to some whistles for the team when they played at home in midweek in the Copa del Rey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé posted on social media network Instagram to encourage the fans to stick together and support the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have to be united, and like that, we can go for all the trophies," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was questioned over his positioning of Mbappé earlier in the season, using the striker through the middle instead of on the left, where Vinicius plays and Mbappé often did at PSG.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the best central striker in the world," said Ancelotti. "He's a great forward, he's very comfortable in the middle, more than on the wing, his ability to get away from players is unique and inside he can take better advantage of that." (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester United's 3-1 defeat to Brighton was their 10th loss of the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788244_1_20250120054447.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United slumped to a 3-1 defeat at home to Brighton as Old Trafford remembered the legendary Denis Law, while Tottenham's troubles also persist after they lost 3-2 at Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest maintained an unlikely title challenge with a 3-2 victory over Southampton to take Nuno Espirito Santo's men level with second-placed Arsenal and within six points of Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, by contrast, are 24 points adrift of the leaders and focused on mere survival after Brighton stormed Old Trafford for the third consecutive season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's men looked to have turned a corner after a thrilling 2-2 draw at Liverpool was followed by knocking Arsenal out of the FA Cup earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after Amad Diallo's late hat-trick papered over the cracks in a 3-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Southampton in midweek, Brighton exposed the glaring holes in the foundations of Amorim's United project.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaoru Mitoma squared for Yankuba Minteh to open the scoring inside five minutes. Bruno Fernandes' penalty levelled for United before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitoma restored Brighton's lead on the hour mark before Andre Onana dropped a cross into the path of Georginio Rutter to rifle in a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Brighton up to ninth and within four points of the top four. United remain 13th but enjoy a 10-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't be comfortable in thinking that this is okay, because it is not," said Fernandes. "I'm not here to lose games and be in the position we are in at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off, tributes were paid to one of the club's greats in Law, who passed away on Friday aged 84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only Scot ever to win the Ballon d'Or, Law is the third top scorer in United's history, with 237 goals in 404 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  A piper played Scottish national anthem "Flower of Scotland" as the teams walked out, with United legends Alex Ferguson, Brian Kidd, Paddy Crerand and Alex Stepney on the pitch as a eulogy was read out over the tannoy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham are now winless in six league games after Everton boosted their survival chances with the first victory of David Moyes' second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal-shy Toffees had failed to score in nine of their previous 11 league games but struck three times before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Calvert Lewin's first goal since September opened the scoring before a brilliant individual run and finish from Iliman Ndiaye. Archie Gray's own goal compounded Tottenham's misery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late goals from Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison reduced Spurs' deficit, but could not avoid a 12th defeat in 22 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a challenging situation for sure, when you are losing players the amount we are at the moment," said under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, who was without 10 first-team regulars. "It's up to me to get us out of it and I've got to be good enough to do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton pull four points clear of the bottom three and within four points of 15th-placed Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest were also rampant in the first 45 minutes to cut the gap at the top and consolidate their lead in the race for a place in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Chris Wood netted before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton salvaged some pride in the second period through Jan Bednarek and Paul Onuachu but they remain on course for an immediate return to the Championship, 10 points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City are back to their best after Phil Foden starred in a 6-0 rout of struggling Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden netted either side of Mateo Kovacic's eye-catching goal as City blew Ipswich away with three first-half goals at Portman Road. Jeremy Doku, Erling Haaland and James McAtee scored after the interval to give fourth-placed City their biggest league win this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's side have won three of their last four league games as they begin the long climb back to respectability after a dismal start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are really pleased, we are back in many things that have defined this team in the last decade, the last years," Guardiola said. "Really pleased for the players, they deserved it a lot. We recovered some identities that we lost in this path."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterner tests lie in wait for City, including a vital Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and looming Premier League clashes with Chelsea and Arsenal. But this was the kind of confident display City used to make look routine during their march to four successive English titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winning is almost certain to prove beyond them as they trail leaders Liverpool by 12 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola will settle for restoring City's pride this term as he rebuilds a team that suddenly grew old and inconsistent before his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that the players, they saw themselves recognise what we are, so that is the best thing I can say," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland, who has scored 112 goals in just 127 appearances for City, this week committed himself to the club until 2034 when he signed a new nine-and-a-half year deal. (AFP)

    Freed Israeli hostages reunited with mothers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinians burst into streets to celebrate and began returning to the rubble of bombed-out homes on Sunday after a ceasefire deal halted fighting in Gaza, while three female hostages freed by Hamas were reunited with their mothers inside Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis with crowds cheering and chanting. In the north of the territory, bombed into oblivion in the war's most intense fighting, people picked their way on narrow roads through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after being lost in the desert for 15 months," said Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, hundreds of Israelis in a square outside the defence headquarters watched a live broadcast from Gaza showing the hostage release on a giant screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd cheered, embraced and wept as three female hostages could be seen getting into a Red Cross vehicle surrounded by armed Hamas fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, the Israeli military said Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari had been reunited with their mothers at a meeting point inside Israel, close to the kibbutz and nearby music festival where they had been abducted in the October 7, 2023 Hamas raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three appeared in good health in a video later released by the military. Damari, who lost two fingers when she was shot the day she was abducted, could be seen smiling and embracing her mother as she held up a bandaged hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like you to tell them: Romi, Doron and Emily – an entire nation embraces you. Welcome home," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a commander by phone as the hostages were driven across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, buses awaited the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. Hamas said the first group to be freed in exchange for the hostages includes 69 women and 21 teenage boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the truce in the 15-month-old war between Israel and Hamas took effect following a three-hour delay during which Israeli warplanes and artillery pounded the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  That last-minute Israeli blitz killed 13 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel blamed Hamas for being late to deliver the names of hostages it would free, and said it had struck terrorists. Hamas said the holdup in providing the list was technical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent," US President Joe Biden said on his last full day in office, welcoming a truce that had eluded US diplomacy for more than a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a long road," Biden said. "But we've reached this point today because of the pressure Israel built on Hamas, backed by the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce calls for fighting to stop, aid to be sent in to Gaza and 33 of nearly 100 Israeli and foreign hostages to go free over the six-week first phase in return for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. (Reuters)

    TikTok restores service in US, thanking Trump

<img alt='TikTok said on Sunday that it is "in the process of restoring service" in the United States. Image: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788237_1_20250120034419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok said on Sunday it was restoring its service after US President-elect Donald Trump said he would revive the app's access in the United States when he returns to power on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of president Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US," the platform said in a message to users.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also issued an earlier statement after US users reported being able to access the Chinese-owned service's website, while the far more widely used TikTok app itself began coming back online for some users with just a few basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service," TikTok said in the earlier statement that also thanked Trump for "providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties (for) providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok stopped working for US users late on Saturday before a law shutting it down on national security grounds took effect on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would "extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like the United States to have a 50 percent ownership position in a joint venture," he wrote on Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the executive order would specify there would be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before his order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had earlier said he would most likely give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong and City University on Sunday asked students to complete anti-scam quizzes as soon as possible. The call came after dozens of students were reportedly scammed.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's student news outlet Campus TV has reported that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a monetary loss of HK$60 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University of Hong Kong says it has sent a kit offered by the police to students to raise awareness of scams.

  The kit includes the latest information on how to identify scams and multiple-choice questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  At City University, the institution said it had received 30 scam reports from students, involving a total of HK$15 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university says it has requested all students to finish the anti-scam survey this semester.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of Palestinians burst into the streets across Gaza as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday, some in celebration, others to visit the graves of relatives, while many rushed back to see what remained of their homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like at last I found some water to drink after getting lost in the desert for 15 months. I feel alive again," Aya, a displaced woman from Gaza City, who has been sheltering in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for over a year, told Reuters via a chat app.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the north of the territory, where some of the most intense Israeli airstrikes and battles with the militants took place, hundreds of people picked their way through a devastated landscape of rubble and twisted metal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Hamas fighters drove through the southern city of Khan Younis, with crowds cheering and chanting, despite an almost three-hour delay in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, which follows 15 months of devastating conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas policemen, dressed in blue police uniform, deployed in some areas after months of trying to keep out of sight to avoid Israeli airstrikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who had gathered to cheer the fighters chanted "Greetings to Al-Qassam Brigades" - the armed wing of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the resistance factions are staying in spite of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu," one fighter told Reuters, referring to the armed wing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a ceasefire, a full and comprehensive one God willing, and there will be no return to war in spite of him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire deal took effect after a nearly three-hour delay, pausing a war that has brought seismic political change to the Middle East and giving hope to Gaza's 2.3 million people, many of whom have been displaced several times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said Israeli military strikes killed at least 13 people in attacks across the enclave during the delay. No more attacks were reported after it took effect at 11.15 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now waiting for the day when we head back to our home in Gaza City," Aya said. "Damaged or not, it doesn't matter, the nightmare of death and starvation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The streets in the shattered Gaza City in the north of the territory were already busy with groups of people waving the Palestinian flag and filming the scenes on their mobile phones. Several carts loaded with household possessions travelled down a thoroughfare scattered with rubble and debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Ayham, 40, sheltering with his family in Khan Younis, said the scene of destruction in his home city was "dreadful", adding that while the ceasefire may have spared lives it was no time for celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in pain, deep pain and it is time that we hug one another and cry," Abu Ayham said via the same app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated ceasefire deal could help usher in an end to the Gaza war, which began after Hamas, which controls the tiny coastal territory, attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's response has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed nearly 47,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza-based health officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long lines of trucks carrying fuel and aid supplies queued up at border crossings in the hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect. The World Food Programme said they began to cross on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal requires 600 truckloads of aid to be allowed into Gaza every day of the initial six-week ceasefire, including 50 carrying fuel. Half of the 600 aid trucks would be delivered to Gaza's north, where experts have warned famine is imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The war ended, but life isn't going to be better because of the destruction and the losses we suffered," Aya said. "But at least there will be no more bloodshed of women and children, I hope." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday said a truce with Hamas began in Gaza at 5.15pm Hong Kong time, nearly three hours after initially scheduled, following a last-minute delay on the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu had said the ceasefire could not take effect until Hamas gave the names of the hostages up for release on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least eight Palestinians died from Israeli attacks that occurred between the period when the ceasefire was meant to begin until it actually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, which ultimately published the names of three Israeli women to be released, attributed the delay in producing the names to "technical reasons", as well as the "complexities of the field situation and the continued bombing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel then confirmed it had received the list, adding that four other living female hostages would be freed in seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Gazans carrying tents, clothes and personal belongings began heading to their homes after the ceasefire took effect following more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinians were seen travelling by truck, donkey cart and on foot back to their homes through devastated swathes of Gaza, particularly in the northern parts of the Palestinian territory. (Reuters/AFP)

    Only 10pc of subdivided flats meet new standards: SoCO

<img alt="SoCO has called on the government to solve the resettlement issue and impose rent controls. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788206_1_20250119161812.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday said a survey they conducted found just one-tenth of subdivided flat residents feel their homes meet the standards of the government’s proposed basic housing units.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCO) said resettlement arrangements should be provided as soon as possible before tenants in substandard subdivided flats are kicked out by landlords.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December last year, the survey polled 211 tenants who are currently living in subdivided flats, bedspace apartments or cubicle apartments.  It comes as the government conducts its public consultation of the new regulatory framework for basic housing units, which runs until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to replace substandard subdivided units with basic housing units. Landlords will face criminal liability if they rent out units that fail to meet the basic housing unit standards, which state that a unit must not be smaller than eight square metres, and have at least one window with an individual toilet.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCO said only 10 percent of respondents said their homes fulfil these requirements, while almost 60 percent believe landlords will have to revamp their units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 30 percent of respondents said they have no idea whether their homes will need renovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The community group also called on authorities to solve the resettlement issue as nearly 40 percent of the respondents said the government should provide rehousing arrangements if they are kicked out of their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, SoCO said the government should impose rent control measures as nearly 32 percent of respondents are worried about not being able to pay the rent for basic housing units. They suggested that the median rent should be set at about HK$2,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang on Sunday said the government did not raise Thailand's travel alert to red because the government needed to reflect the situation accurately.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Tang explained that victims were not kidnapped in Thailand, but rather lured there before being transported elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Friday, the government raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, but the alert level for other parts of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia remains at amber – the lowest level of the three-tier outward travel alert system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were basically lured to Thailand before being transported to scam farms in Myanmar. There hasn't been a single case of someone being kidnapped within Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certain areas in Myanmar are being used as scam farms, guarded by military police and armed personnel. That's where the danger lies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister was also asked about the government's role in rescue efforts and reports of victims being released after a ransom was paid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some people were able to return without paying ransom. Of course, when faced with these situations, our priority is to bring people back safely," he responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang stressed that officials will pursue all means to secure the safe return of stranded Hongkongers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A long-awaited ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war was delayed on Sunday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the last minute that it would not take effect until the Palestinian militant group provided a list of the hostages to be released.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, while "affirming its commitment" to the terms of the ceasefire, said: "The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons."
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Netanyahu's office, issued less than an hour before the truce was to start, said he had "instructed the IDF (military) that the ceasefire... will not begin until Israel has received the list".
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the ceasefire goes ahead, a total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by the October 7 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire", he said: "If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting continued right up to the eve of the truce, with Gaza's civil defence agency saying that at least five members of one family were killed when an Israeli strike hit their tent in the southern city of Khan Yunis. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he will promote Hong Kong's advantages as a super connector and super value-adder on his upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland, where he will attend the World Economic Forum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog on Sunday, Chan said business leaders are keen to learn more about developments in Hong Kong, and added that he will introduce policies that the SAR has adopted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will also attend the conference to deliver a speech, and noted that "the economic conditions and development of the mainland has become one of the important highlights in annual conferences in recent years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said that the central government will continue to support the SAR's capital market development by significantly increasing the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the Asian Financial Forum held in Hong Kong earlier had facilitated exchanges between leaders from Europe, the United States, and new markets along the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said finance leaders from Western countries have reaffirmed Hong Kong's role in bridging markets across the world with those on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whereas the global South hopes Hong Kong can diversify its fundraising capabilities to support their projects, including infrastructure, economic development, and green transition," he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and RTHK on Sunday announced they have jointly produced a series of programmes to promote patriotism and the rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The initiative follows last year's establishment of the Working Group on Patriotic Education, which aims to strengthen education about national history and Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The working group's convenor Starry Lee, who is also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said there are four major programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of [these programmes], as a combination of other tasks and events, is to help to build up the cultural awareness of Hong Kong people and their understanding towards our country," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the working group will cooperate with different government departments and community stakeholders to organise events this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a launch ceremony on Sunday, Under Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Clement Woo, said the programmes will explain the Basic Law and the Constitution through everyday scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said the government has been working hard to help people understand these two documents better through diverse channels and innovative ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan, working group member and National People's Congress deputy Cally Kwong, and Basic Law Committee member Simon Lee also attended the ceremony.

 The head of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong on Sunday warned that the SAR’s winter flu season has not peaked, and that occupancy rates at hospitals are continuing to rise.
 <br>
  <br>
  David Hui said those who have been hospitalised for the flu included children aged up to 5 and people who are 65 or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there were 37 severe cases among adults who needed intensive care in the second week of the month. Fifteen of these patients died. The professor pointed out that 25 of these people had not received the influenza vaccine, and recommended that residents get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Commercial Radio, Hui said that a general vaccination rate of 70 percent to 80 percent is ideal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as of last month, he said the rate for infants and young children was 48 percent, and those aged 50 to 64 was only 20 percent, while the rate was 45 percent for those aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also said that influenza cases in most northern hemisphere regions are on the rise, and that most of them involve H1N1 influenza A.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the current flu season is expected to peak early next month, and decline around mid-March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Sunday gave assurances that transportation services to and from the airport will not be affected by the development of SKYTOPIA.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the authority revealed the new expansion of Hong Kong's Airport City, which will include an arts hub, aimed at attracting visitors from both home and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have developed an autonomous vehicle system that would link from the border point and also from 11 Skies all the way to the MTR station in Tung Chung, which means that in [the] future, for the people from Hong Kong who want to go to SKYTOPIA, they don't actually have to use the Airport Express link," the authority's chairman Fred Lam told reporters after attending a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the vehicle system will connect Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge's Hong Kong port with the Airport City by the start of 2026, and be extended to Tung Chung station by 2028. This, he explained, would relieve pressure on the Airport Express line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also developing two autonomous car parks at the restricted area of the border control area. Very soon, cars from Macau and Guangdong will be able to use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge to reach the airport and also the SKYTOPIA area, this will also alleviate traffic problems in the future," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority chief also said the development will see the construction of the city’s largest yacht bay, that would provide at least 500 docking spaces, as well a jet fresh market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the majority of parking spaces will be for yachts from around the Greater Bay Area and even other regions in Asia. We also hope to accommodate larger yachts, such as those longer than 70 metres, so yachts from further away can also come. Our positioning is towards those with better economic conditions, allowing them to drive their yacht and spend a few days in the city," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the jet fresh market would allow visitors to enjoy the best fruits, meat and seafood from around the world due to the city's strong aviation network, import control and food safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority had said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.

    TikTok stops working for US users

<img alt="Under a law passed last year, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788182_1_20250119110315.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

    Lukaku gets win for Napoli, Juve sink Milan

<img alt="Romelu Lukaku of SSC Napoli celebrates after a goal during the football match against Atalanta BC in Bergamo, Italy. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788167_1_20250119083319.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romelu Lukaku fired Napoli six points clear at the top of Serie A with the decisive goal in Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win at title rivals Atalanta, as Juventus beat AC Milan 2-0 to move into the Champions League spots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Belgium striker Lukaku nodded home his eighth Napoli goal from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's perfect cross in the 78th minute to give Antonio Conte's team a statement win in Bergamo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matteo Politano and Scott McTominay also scored for Napoli who have 50 points from 21 matches and have made it clear that they are now the team to beat in this year's title race after scoring three times from their only shots on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say whether it's my most important goal (for Napoli) but the win is important. We showed tonight that we're a top team," said Lukaku to Sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Napoli are gunning for a second Scudetto in three seasons and await the response from champions and closest challengers Inter Milan, who also have a game in hand, against struggling Empoli on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sixth straight win is the perfect boost Napoli need for another massive clash with Conte's old team Juventus, in Naples, this time next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another test for us, to see where we are," added Lukaku.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, goals in five second-half minutes from Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah gave Juventus a deserved win in Turin which pushed Thiago Motta's side up to fourth, a point ahead of Lazio who are at Verona on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeaten Juve snapped a run of three straight draws which had taken their tally of league stalemates to 13, with Saturday's win just their eighth in 21 fixtures in Italy's top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Weah emulated his father in the 64th minute by netting in a Juventus match with Milan 25 years after Ballon d'Or-winner George Weah did the same - for Milan against Juve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The boys are growing, match after match, and getting to the point that they can put in a performance like the one they did tonight," said Motta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because they all work really hard every day... today's win is the reward." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors, shocked the film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

 Temperamental Russian Daniil Medvedev was on Saturday fined US$76,000 over his behaviour at the Australian Open, where he destroyed a net camera, threw his racquet and skipped a post-match press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number five was penalised US$10,000 for a meltdown during his five-set first-round win against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej, when he mangled his racquet and ruined the camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced an even bigger penalty – US$66,000 – over his antics in the next round when he crashed out to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the match he threw his racquet toward the sidelines, skidding across the court until it reached an advertising panel near his bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also argued with the umpire after being called out for repeated foot faults, then skipped his obligatory post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev had reached three of the last four Australian Open finals, including in 2024 when he imploded after leading by two sets, losing to Jannik Sinner. (AFP)
