<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican Republic rescue workers ended the search for survivors of a nightclub roof collapse as the death toll surpassed 180 in the Caribbean nation's worst disaster in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel late on Wednesday reported 60 more deaths compared to the morning's count, with the total confirmed tally reaching 184.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official statement had earlier said that "all reasonable possibilities of finding more survivors" had been exhausted, and the focus of the operation will turn to recovering bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we will complete the rescue effort," said Jose Luis Frometa Herasme, head of the fire service in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo, where the tragedy ocurred at the Jet Set nightclub in the early hours of Tuesday, sending shockwaves through the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of missing people were still waiting desperately for news on Wednesday of their loved ones outside the ruined club, at hospitals and at the local morgue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers, aided by sniffer dogs, had spent two days combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the roof of the club – a fixture of Santo Domingo's nightlife for half a century – had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 500 people were also injured when the roof caved in while renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez and two former Major League Baseball players were among the dead.
  <br>

    Alejandro Tabilo stuns Djokovic in Monte Carlo

<img alt="Novak Djokovic crashes out of Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the second round. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799731_1_20250410114405.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic rued a "horrible" performance as he crashed out of the Monte-Carlo Masters in his opening match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fifth-ranked Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the second round  on Wednesday, making an inauspicious start to his clay season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, 37, went into the tournament hampered by an eye infection that has been troubling him since the semi-finals in Miami at the end of March and admitting that he did not have "very high" expectations for Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  As it transpired a sluggish performance meant that Tabilo, who also beat Djokovic on clay in last year's Italian Open in Rome, faced few difficulties in claiming a rare 2-0 head-to-head record against the 24-time Grand Slam winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was actually more like the worst day [at the office]," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb, who is chasing his 100th ATP title, has not won a tournament since taking gold at last year's Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic brushed off any fitness concerns and said his main focus for the clay season was the French Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to play in Madrid later this month for the first time since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expected myself at least to have put a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible," said Djokovic, who has only once reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo since the last of his two titles in the principality in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But this bad, I didn't expect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tabilo, ranked 32 in the world, will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there," said Tabilo, who earned consecutive tour-level wins for the first time since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an unreal match." (AFP)

    Far right targets Canada PM as election looms large

<img alt="Mark Carney and his wife Diana Fox are targeted because of a photograph showing them with Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799735_1_20250410115043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is leaning into his banking background as his country fights a trade war with the United States, but his financial ties have also made him a target for conspiracy theories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incorporating tropes familiar to followers of the far-right QAnon movement, conspiratorial social media posts about the Liberal leader have surged ahead of the country's April 28 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Posts range from false claims he recited a "satanic chant" at a campaign event to AI-generated images of him in a pool with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the ideal person to be targeted here, for sure, due to his background, as well as his financial work," said Ahmed Al-Rawi, an associate professor of communications at Canada's Simon Fraser University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before serving as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney had a lucrative career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mentioning a candidate's affiliation with the global financial elite, and particularly the World Economic Forum, has become a dog whistle for the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Conservatives have leapt to highlight Carney's connections to the annual gathering in Davos, with party leader Pierre Poilievre in January describing him as "the voice for the billionaire globalist elite that have been impoverishing the working class around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-establishment sentiment is present on the left, but Al-Rawi noted people trying to associate Carney with a supposed circle of nefarious elites were "mostly far-right players and provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many posts have zeroed in on a picture from a festival in Britain showing Carney and his wife standing next to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  This 2013 photo is authentic, but it precipitated the spread of several AI-generated images shared to emphasize a supposed link between Carney and Epstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian Digital Media Research Network found a small number of bot accounts pushed the association by replying to posts from Canadian political figures. Once larger accounts began to engage with the claims, millions of views rolled in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Rawi said for conspiracy theorists, a grain of truth mixed with fabricated evidence is enough for a claim to truly take hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman with the Carney campaign said the claims being spread were "false and disinformation" and said any insinuated connection with Maxwell was incorrect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to high school with Mark Carney's wife's sister," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although they may have bumped into each other in public settings, they are not friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts said engagement with the claims appears to be somewhat contained to groups already critical of Carney's Liberal Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmen Celestini, an assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Waterloo, said the push appears to be building on attacks that were successful in hitting Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just sort of makes sense to move those conspiracy theories towards Carney," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls indicate that Carney's replacement of Trudeau coincided with a surge in Liberal support. (AFP)

    Lego opens US$1bn factory in Vietnam

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lego has opened a US$1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country hopes the plant’s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing. (AP)

<img alt="Lawmaker Jeffrey Lam says China was forced into taking action due to aggressive moves by the United States. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799732_1_20250410114542.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Thursday said China was justified in retaliating against US tariffs with trade levies of its own.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said the country was only responding to what he said were America's "bullying tactics", but held out hope that a deal could eventually be worked out between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is always open to a fair talk, you know, sitting at the table, not by just starting something, you know, adding 10 percent, 10 percent, 34 percent and 50 percent, forcing other countries to accept [their terms]...  I think we should all sit down and talk about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lam expressed confidence that Hong Kong could weather the storm, he said things could get tough if the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continued, adding he was working with the government to ensure support for local exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am asking the government to help. I met with HKMA the other day, first of all, I asked them to ask the banks to extend loans, loan repayment periods. So this is first very, very important and essential. And I also [asked] to extend the interest only repayment relief, which is the payment holiday for 12 more months."

    2028 Olympics to make a splash with six new events

<img alt="Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799728_1_20250410112258.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme, with 50m backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke to be contested for the first time at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Previously, only freestyle was raced over the sport's shortest distance despite all four strokes being on the schedule at world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Wednesday of their inclusion for Los Angeles brings the swimming gold medal count to 41 from 35 at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there will be 55 medals awarded in aquatics – which also includes artistic swimming, water polo, diving, and open water – more than any other sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's decision is a testament to the continued evolution of swimming at the Olympic Games," said World Aquatics president Husain Al Musallam after the move was ratified by the International Olympic Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Including these six new events enhances the programme's balance and adds more opportunities for athletes to showcase their skills on the world's biggest stage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming is one only four sports contested at every Olympics since the first Games in 1896, alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics and fencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Australia have long been dominant in the pool, with the two nations again at the forefront in Paris last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC also announced that the number of female athletes competing in Los Angeles (5,333) will exceed men (5,167) for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows the women's football tournament being boosted to 16 teams. The men's competition has 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional women's weight category in boxing and two extra women's water polo teams ensure gender parity in those sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of new mixed-team events were also confirmed, including in golf, gymnastics and table tennis, while a 4x100m mixed relay was added to the track and field competition. (AFP)

    Doncic loss hits home for Dallas in emotional return

<img alt="Luka Doncic and LeBron James keep things cool in the fourth quarter against the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799727_1_20250410111305.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic shrugged off the raw emotion of his return to Dallas with a dazzling 45-point display against his former club as the Los Angeles Lakers downed the Mavericks 112-97 to punch their ticket to the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers from Dallas in February in one of the most shocking trades in NBA history, was given a rousing reception by Mavs fans packed into the American Airlines Center to pay tribute to their former hero  on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pre-game video montage was screened in the arena just before Doncic was introduced to the sellout crowd of 20,841 fans, many wearing t-shirts bearing the words "Thanks for Everything", written in the 26-year-old's native Slovenian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic visibly teared up as he watched the tribute, and looked distraught as he was comforted by Lakers team-mate LeBron James moments before tip-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after that emotional pre-game ceremony, Doncic quickly snapped into game mode, swiftly getting into his scoring groove to give Mavericks fans a painful reminder of the generational talent that was traded away by the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic scored 14 in the first quarter alone, and added a further 17 in the second period to help the Lakers into a 60-57 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic's rate of scoring slowed in the second half, leaving James to produce a trademark fourth quarter burst to close out victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was still time for Doncic to sign off in style, nailing an imperious three-pointer to push the Lakers into a 108-94 lead shortly before exiting the game to a standing ovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The applause swiftly morphed into chants of "Fire Nico" – a reference to the Dallas general manager Nico Harrison who has been roundly criticised by Mavs for engineering the trade that sent Doncic to Los Angeles in exchange for Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic later admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like 'There's no way I'm playing this game'," he told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me.

  "It brought tears to my eyes.

  <br>
  "Just a lot of great memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love these fans, I love this city but it's time to move on."

  The victory means the Lakers, who improved to 49-31, can clinch third seed in the Western Conference if they win one of their final two regular-season games.

 China's consumer prices fell for the second straight month in March, as caution grows over the economic outlook amid mounting tariff risks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent last month from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. That was slower than February's 0.7 percent decline, but missed the Reuters poll forecast for prices to remain flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.4 percent month-on-month, against a 0.2 percent fall in February and missing an estimated 0.3 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, edged up 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, reversing a 0.1 percent fall in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index, meanwhile, declined 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, deepening the 2.2 percent fall in February, the weakest in four months and below the expected 2.3 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing unveiled a series of measures to boost the economy last year, including cutting interest rates and cancelling restrictions on the purchase of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s economic recovery is also facing headwinds after US President Donald Trump further raised tariffs on China to 125 percent. (Reuters/AFP)

<img alt="Raphinha scores Barcelona's first goal, helping the Catalans to a four-goal advantage going into their away game in the second leg. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799726_1_20250410105544.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona coach Hansi Flick warned their Champions League rivals his team are still looking to improve after beating Borussia Dortmund 4-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans put one foot into the semi-finals with the first leg thrashing of last year's runners-up at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca are the competition's top scorers with 36 goals and their dynamic attacking trio of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Lamine Yamal strike fear into the hearts of opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to keep improving, today we saw some points we can improve on," Flick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will analyse this game and I will tell the players they did very well, but there are still things to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy with the result today but it's just the first step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted his 12th Champions League goal of the season – he is the top scorer in the competition – and added two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian has 19 direct goal contributions this season in Europe, equalling former Barca great Lionel Messi's record for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always thought he's an extraordinary player... the team is set on his shoulders, his dynamism," said the coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  His opposite number Niko Kovac was disappointed with Dortmund's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a deserved defeat [but] we could have got a goal, as we all know the return leg will be very difficult," said Kovac.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am optimistic but I have to be a realist... it was a very big result, our chances of going through are minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know it will be difficult but we have to have a spark of hope, because without that spark it will be impossible." (AFP)

<img alt="Khvicha Kvaratskhelia runs a gauntlet of four Aston Villa players to give PSG the lead in their quarterfinal first-leg match in Paris. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799721_1_20250410104557.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa coach Unai Emery insists he still believes his side can get the better of Paris Saint-Germain and reach the Champions League semi-finals despite a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of their last-eight tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa took the lead in the first half in Paris through Morgan Rogers, only for the hosts to turn the game on its head thanks to stunning strikes by Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia either side of the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a Nuno Mendes effort in stoppage time, which gives PSG a two-goal cushion to take to Villa Park for the return leg, appears to leave Emery's side with a huge task to turn the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 2-1 we were thinking about playing to win in the next match, and at 3-1 it is still the same," Emery said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are here and enjoying it, and I am very proud of the players. We competed fantastically and we were close to getting a good result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end, with this goal, it is still more or less the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Villa Park is our home, and hopefully there we will be stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But of course they are still favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They showed their power and individual quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second leg will be just as difficult at 3-1 as it was at 2-1. We have to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emery's opposite number, Luis Enrique, expressed delight but emphasised that PSG would not sit back and "speculate" in the second leg on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quality of PSG's goals was exceptional, with Doue's marvellous strike for the equaliser probably topped by Kvaratskhelia's remarkable individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendes then rounded Emiliano Martinez to make it 3-1 following a superb Ousmane Dembele pass, capping PSG's victory in a game that saw them enjoy 68 percent possession and 30 attempts on goal to Villa's eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our objective in Birmingham is clear, to try to win the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how to speculate, or to sit back and defend deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will try to have the ball and attack more than the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't doubt it will be harder there but that is what we will try to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG will have skipper Marquinhos available again to line up in central defence in the return after he sat out the first leg due to suspension. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have exchanged views on strengthening their economic and trade cooperation in response to US tariffs, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said China and the EU vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came after Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and the European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held a talk via video on Tuesday, during which they discussed various issues, including enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responses to the US imposition of so-called "reciprocal tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged China and the EU to jointly safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system and adhere to trade liberalisation and facilitation, "which will inject more stability and certainty into the world economy and global trade", the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and EU also discussed creating a more favourable business environment for enterprises and trade transfer issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will continue to strengthen communication under the World Trade Organization framework and jointly promote WTO reform, the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, both sides will immediately carry out negotiations on electric vehicle price commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU had imposed tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on China-made electric vehicles at the end of October, on top of the bloc's standard 10 percent car import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said last week that the two sides have agreed to restart negotiations on minimum price commitments on Chinese EVs but did not specify when that would resume. (Reuters, additional reporting by Xinhua)

 Hong Kong, China Sanda martial artist Leung Yu-hong triumphed at the 10th Sanda World Cup in Jiangyin, claiming gold in the men’s 60-kilos category.

  The SAR team further showcased its prowess at the biennial event, earning three additional medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunny Cheung secured silver in the men’s 70-kilos division, while Cai Jia-hao and Chan Tsz-ching added bronze medals to the team’s haul in the men's over 90-kilogrammes and the women's 56-kilogrammes respectively.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has backtracked on emergency food aid cuts it announced for 14 countries, restoring assistance to six of them, the UN's World Food Program said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The UN agency, already struggling with financing woes, said on Monday that the United States advised it that Washington was eliminating emergency food aid to those 14 poor and otherwise troubled countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP said the cuts amounted to a "death sentence" for millions of hungry or starving people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the United States has now reversed course and said it will continue sending food aid to Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, a WFP program official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, with aid now cut off for the other eight countries, "hunger will deepen, millions of lives will be lost, entire regions will be destabilized," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  These eight countries are Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Yemen, Chad, Mali, Nigeria and Madagascar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation. It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

    Israel says it's seizing 'large areas' of Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday its troops were seizing "large areas" in Gaza and making the Palestinian territory "smaller and more isolated", as an air strike on a residential block killed at least 23 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz's comments come weeks into a renewed offensive by the military on the war-battered territory, which has displaced hundreds of thousands, while an aid blockade has revived the spectre of famine for its 2.4 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said that France plans to recognise a Palestinian state in the "coming months", a move that risks antagonising Israel which insists such moves by foreign states are premature.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz said that "large areas are being seized and added to Israel's security zones, leaving Gaza smaller and more isolated", during a visit to the newly announced Morag Corridor between the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Yunis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz emphasised that Israel would keep increasing pressure on Gaza "until the hostages are freed and Hamas is defeated".
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz also said that Israel was encouraging plans for "voluntary emigration... in accordance with the vision of the US president, which we are working to implement".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had earlier this year proposed a plan to develop Gaza into a "Riviera of the Middle East" while displacing its population elsewhere.

  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency meanwhile said an Israeli air strike on a residential building in Gaza City killed at least 23 people, most of them children or women, while the military said it targeted a "senior Hamas" militant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on Gaza on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 2023 attack that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians. (AFP)

<img alt="French Economy Minister Eric Lombard said the annual growth forecast would be trimmed to 0.7 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799688_1_20250410064059.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government has cut its growth forecast for 2025 because of the uncertainty over world trade, the economy minister said on Wednesday just hours after US President Donald Trump paused a massive hike in tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had forecast annual growth of 0.9 percent when presenting its 2025 budget, but Economy Minister Eric Lombard told TF1 television that it would be trimmed to 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of France had already revised its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7 percent in March, and the French Economic Observatory (OFCE) lowered its forecast to 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about a possible further downward revision, the minister said that "would depend on the negotiations that will be initiated with the United States and the decisions that are taken on customs duties."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we succeed in lowering tariffs, we could even get better, and if not, we will see," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lombard ruled out raising taxes in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before his interview, Trump announced that he was suspending levies on all countries except China for three months, after US bond and equity markets had tumbled for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good news, but we must remain calm," Lombard told LCI television, saying he hoped to find "a new agreement" with the Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau welcomed the US move which he called "a return to economic realism and a little reality". But he warned that US policy remained "unpredictable" and that there would be a "negative impact" in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy, which exports much more to the US than France, earlier in the day halved its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.6 percent. (AFP)

    Wall Street soars on Trump tariff pause

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street made dramatic gains after Donald Trump changed course. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799682_1_20250410051523.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher on Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones surged 7.9 percent to 40,608, and the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq jumped 12.2 percent to 17,124.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indexes bounced on Wednesday afternoon as Trump announced a 90-day pause in country-specific tariffs that came into place earlier that day, except levies on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affected US trading partners, excluding China, would instead face a 10 percent tariff rate, temporarily reverting to a level that took effect over the weekend, though that already roiled markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump singled out the world's second biggest economy, however, saying its tariff rate would be raised to a prohibitive 125 percent "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were waiting for any sense of a more reasonable trade process, saying this situation might "be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he cautioned that "China will become hyper-aware of the fact that they're now being isolated in this process." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Relatives of people trapped under the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub that collapsed, killing over 120, waited anxiously for news on Wednesday as hopes of finding their loved ones alive began to fade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The disaster at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo sent shockwaves through the Caribbean nation, a major tourism destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people were killed and over 500 injured when the club's roof caved in while renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez was performing for a crowd of hundreds in the early hours of Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez himself died in the calamity, as well as two former Major League Baseball players among the party-goers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of relatives gathered outside the club, hospitals and the city morgue on Wednesday, clamouring for news as forensic teams continued to identify the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 300 rescue workers continued combing through mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets, supported by firefighters from Puerto Rico and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial images of the site showed a scene resembling the aftermath of an earthquake, with a gaping hole where the club's roof had been.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, director of emergency operations, said rescue crews still had "24 to 36 hours of work left" to find survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hope is the last thing we lose," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump abruptly backed down on Wednesday in his global trade war with a 90-day pause for most countries – but slapped even more levies against China in what has become a full-scale confrontation between the world's two largest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following days of global market turmoil, Wall Street stocks surged in reaction to Trump's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have authorized a 90-day PAUSE" on higher tariffs that took effect on Wednesday, Trump said on his Truth Social network, saying he took the decision after more than 75 countries had reached out to negotiate and did not retaliate against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a flat rate of 10 percent tariffs on all countries that took effect on Saturday will remain in place. This marked a stunning reverse from often punishing levies that hit even many of the closest US allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump accused China of still "ripping off" his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 percent, effective immediately," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had only hours earlier ramped up the duties on Chinese goods to a giant 104 percent. China then retaliated by raising tariffs on US imports to 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable," Trump said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's 3-0 win over Real Madrid means at least five Premier League teams will play in next season's Champions League, the English top flight confirmed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top four sides in the Premier League automatically qualify for Europe's top club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But due to the success of English clubs in the three European competitions, England is now guaranteed a top-two placing in Uefa's association club coefficient rankings, which earns a European Performance Spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  England lead the way, with Spain and Italy next on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five English teams are involved in the quarter-finals of the various European competitions – Arsenal and Aston Villa in the Champions League, Manchester United and Tottenham in the Europa League and Chelsea in the Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League could potentially have as many as seven clubs in next season's Champions League – the top five teams in the league, plus the Champions League winners and the Europa League winners if they finish outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are almost certain to win the Premier League and Arsenal, in second, are well-placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there is a scrap for the remaining Champions League spots, with just six points separating third-placed Nottingham Forest from Villa, in seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal shocked 15-time European champions Real Madrid 3-0 on Tuesday in the first leg of their quarter-final, with Villa in action against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's search and rescue team on Wednesday night returned home from Myanmar, where they supported relief efforts following a devastating earthquake that struck the country last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government held a welcome-home ceremony for the team as they arrived at Chek Lap Kok airport at about 10 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee shook hands with each member and thanked the team for its efforts, calling them a source of pride for Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the ceremony, he said the team was dispatched 61 times during the 11 days they were in Myanmar, and travelled to 57 locations for rescue and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rescue operation was full of challenges. There were risks of aftershocks, and the team had to overcome traffic and communication disruptions, and severely damaged infrastructure at the disaster-stricken areas," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The local weather was also extremely hot, with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius for many days. The areas were covered in dust and had a serious mosquito infestation. These hugely increased the difficulty for rescue."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the 51-member team – made up of personnel from various departments and two search dogs – worked closely with the mainland rescue team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two teams joined hands to rescue nine people following the 7.7-magnitude quake which killed nearly 4,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the airport ceremony was the consul-general of Myanmar Han Win Naing, who expressed appreciation to the SAR government and the rescue team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You worked tirelessly amidst the crumbling structures, aftershocks and emotional turmoil, risking your lives to save others. Your actions reflect the essence of humanity, putting others before self," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, Secretary for Security Chris Tang, along with other government officials, also attended the ceremony.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Wednesday adopted its first measures hitting back at US President Donald Trump's tariffs, targeting more than 20 billion euros of US products including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products.
 <br>
  <br>
  "These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the US agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome," the European Commission said in a statement issued after EU member states greenlit the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies are retaliation for US duties on steel and aluminium imposed last month – with Europe's response to Trump's latest tariffs salvo yet to be announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duties will start to be collected under the measures on April 15, the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU considers US tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels stressed it wanted a deal that "would be balanced and mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also slapped a 25-percent tariff on car imports from the EU, and targeted the bloc with so-called reciprocal tariffs of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  An EU spokesman said its response to those measures could be unveiled as early as next week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday denounced the reintroduction of a United States bill that threatens closures of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Offices (ETO) in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR said that the ETOs' role of promoting economic and trade cooperation between the city and the US should not be challenged, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that the ETOs are official institutions representing the SAR in the US and that "the smearing attack" on these offices launched by certain US politicians disrupts day-to-day exchanges between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  These politicians should stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, the spokesperson said, adding that any further moves in the wrong direction will be met with countermeasures.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will increase tariffs on US goods by 50 percent, bringing it to a total of 84 percent, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tariff, which previously stood at 34 percent, takes effect from Thursday at 12.01pm Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariff escalation against China by the United States simply piles mistakes on top of mistakes [and] severely infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's moves "severely damage the multilateral rules-based trade system", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes as US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into force on Wednesday. They had been set at 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that countries which do not retaliate to US President Donald Trump's fresh tariffs would not face higher rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what a lot of people are missing here is that the levels that were put out last Wednesday are a ceiling, if you don't retaliate," Bessent told a summit in Washington, adding that China has chosen to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing had earlier on Wednesday said the nation will resolutely take countermeasures and fight till the end if the US insists on further escalating economic and trade restrictive measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also told the World Trade Organization that the US' tariffs threatened to further destabilise global trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation has dangerously escalated...As one of the affected members, China expresses grave concern and firm opposition to this reckless move," it said in a statement to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism late on Wednesday issued a travel alert for Chinese people visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it issued the alert because of the worsening economic and trade relations between the two countries, as well as the security situation in the US. (Additional reporting by Reuters and AFP)

 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a residential building in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City killed at least 20 people on Wednesday, as the military said they were looking into the attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the strike resulted in "20 martyrs and more than 40 injured" and the search for bodies in the rubble was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. Efforts to restore the truce have so far failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  An October 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas's political bureau, said on Tuesday that it was "necessary to reach a ceasefire" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "communication with the mediators is still ongoing" but that "so far, there are no new proposals".
  <br>
  <br>
  Badran said Hamas "is open to all ideas that would lead to a ceasefire and stop the genocide enacted against our Palestinian people".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that new negotiations were in the works aimed at getting more hostages released from captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack on Israel, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

    Hezbollah 'ready for talks on disarmament'

<img alt="Israeli military exhibit seized Hezbollah weapons, without specifying when and where they were confiscated, near the border with Lebanon last year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799628_1_20250409180051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As calls for Lebanon's Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior official from the group said it is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prospect of talks aimed at securing Hezbollah's disarmament – unimaginable when it was at the zenith of its power just two years ago – underlines dramatic shifts in the Middle East power balance since Israel pummelled the Iran-backed group in a devastating conflict triggered by the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-backed President Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah emerged severely weakened from the 2024 conflict with Israel when its top leaders and thousands of its fighters were killed and much of its rocket arsenal destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blow was compounded when its ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled from power in Syria, cutting its supply lines from Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior Hezbollah official said the group was ready to discuss its arms in the context of a national defence strategy but this hinged on Israel pulling out its troops from five hilltops in south Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah is ready to discuss the matter of its arms if Israel withdraws from the five points, and halts its aggression against Lebanese," the senior official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel, which sent ground troops into south Lebanon during the war, has largely withdrawn but decided in February not to leave the five hilltop positions. It said it intended eventually to hand them over to Lebanese troops once it was sure the security situation allowed. (Reuters)

 Search and rescue teams from Hong Kong and the mainland returned to Beijing on Wednesday afternoon after completing their missions in quake-hit Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teams boarded four Chinese Air Force planes at the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw and arrived in Beijing at about 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management held a welcoming ceremony at the Beijing Capital International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, Secretary for Security Chris Tang and the Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung were also present at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials, together with the SAR team, are expected back in Hong Kong on Wednesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams rescued nine people following last month's massive quake that killed thousands.

 Equities tumbled on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war by hitting China with tariffs of more than 100 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a brief respite on Tuesday, investors were once again panicking amid fears Trump's latest moves will spark a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly four percent, while South Korea's Kospi fell 1.74 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hong Kong stocks bucked the downward trend as reports say Beijing is mulling stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index closed up 0.68 percent to close at 20,264.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reuters news agency has reported that the nation's top leaders plan to meet as soon as Wednesday to hammer out measures to boost the economy and stabilise capital markets. (Agencies)

    Small parcels tariff triples in Trump escalation

<img alt="Small parcels sent from Hong Kong after May 2 and before June 1 will be subject to a US$75 levy and US$150 after that. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799614_2_20250409164405.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US tariff on small goods parcels sent from mainland China and Hong Kong has been tripled in the latest escalation by US President Donald Trump of the ongoing trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duty on small parcels, previously exempt from duties as part of the de diminis rule, will be increased to US$75 from the US$25 that Trump had set as part of his original opening salvo in the trade war on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US$75 duty will take effect on parcels sent from May 2 and before June 1, which was the period when the original US$25 levy was to come into play. That US$25 levy was originally set to be increased to US$50 after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  An amendment to the so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Wednesday Hong Kong time said the new rate on packages priced up to US$800 will be 90 percent of their value, up from the original 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the amendment, the per postal item fee will also be tripled to US$150 from the planned US$50 that was to go into effect after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff came into play as Trump made good on his punitive measure against China after it had reciprocated his 34 percent tariffs by a similar quantum.
  <br>
  <br>
  That brought his latest tariffs to 84 percent, making the total, on top of the 20 percent in levies imposed in February and March, 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The punitive tariffs come as around 60 percent of all de minimis packages entering the United States come from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, meanwhile expressed strong disapproval over the US' move.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman said the US measures were unreasonable, and its ever-changing policies have caused confusion and inconvenience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer upholds free trade, arbitrarily undermining the rules of the World Trade Organization jointly established by the international community, seriously impeding the multilateral trading system and globalisation process, and disrupting the global supply chain," the spokesman wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed out that Hongkong Post will not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that, for now, Hongkong Post will maintain postal services to the US, but it will announce later the temporary suspension arrangement for postal services to the country.

    Revamped HK$2 subsidy scheme to take effect earlier
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799608_1_20250409161316.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme will be in place sooner than expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those changes were unveiled by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget address in February, and officials have said it would take about 18 months to adjust Octopus machines to accommodate the new fares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, fares for more expensive routes will be higher than HK$2, with elderly and disabled passengers paying 20 percent of trips that cost more than HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare minister Chris Sun told lawmakers on Wednesday that the changes could be implemented in about 12 months' time thanks to efforts by transport operators and the Octopus Cards Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can now say with certainty that the HK$2, or 20 percent of fare, will be implemented in April 2026, which is five months earlier than the original estimate," he said at a special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said this would mean extra savings of HK$260 million in public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move to cap the number of HK$2 subsidised trips to 240 per person each month will be in effect about two years from now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee councillor Carmen Kan asked whether officials can implement the updated scheme even quicker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the administration is already taking the least amount of time possible, because officials still have to manually adjust every single machine on vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked whether officials could bring in more measures – such as tougher penalties or new laws – to tackle abuse or misuse of the JoyYou Card for the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials had already raised the penalty for people using the card and posing as someone else, adding that some suspects were taken to court.

 China said on Wednesday it is verifying reports of Chinese nationals being captured in Ukraine.

  <br>
  Speaking in a regular briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian also urged its citizens to avoid conflict zones and participating in wars, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had captured two Chinese citizens fighting alongside Russian forces.
  <br>

  "The Chinese side is verifying relevant information with the Ukrainian side," Lin said.

 The Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures and fight till the end if the United States insists on further escalating economic and trade restrictive measures, with firm will and abundant means.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that there is no winner in a trade war, and China does not want a trade war, but the Chinese government will by no means sit by when the legitimate rights and interests of its people are being hurt and deprived," an official with the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also said Beijing hopes Washington will immediately remove its unilateral imposition of tariffs, and work with China to strengthen dialogue, manage differences and promote cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the guise of pursuing "reciprocity" and "fairness," the US is engaging in zero-sum games and, in essence, seeking "America First" and "American exceptionalism," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the US is also deliberately severing the well-established global industrial and supply chains and breaking the market-oriented free trade rules, the official said these practices seriously interrupt the economic development of countries around the globe and affect the long-term stable growth of the world economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that "the Chinese people's legitimate right to development is inalienable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's sovereignty, security and development interests are inviolable," he said. "We will continue to take firm and forceful measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests." (Xinhua & agencies)

 President Xi Jinping has made a key speech at a government meeting in Beijing, where he stressed the importance of neighbouring countries and the need to deepen all-round cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday that Xi told the central conference on work related to neighbouring countries that Beijing will strive to open new ground for China's neighbourhood work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting, held from April 8 to 9, pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen strategic mutual trust with neighbouring countries, support the stabilisation of regional countries’ development and properly manage differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there is a need to jointly safeguard the stability of the region and carry out security and law enforcement cooperation to cope with risks and challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting also noted that the nation’s relationship with neighbouring countries is at its best in recent times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Malaysia announced on Wednesday that it will host President Xi for a three-day visit next week.
  <br>

    China-US trade ties mutually beneficial: white paper

<img alt="The white paper says the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799602_1_20250409154105.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, and cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation harms both, said a white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maintaining the stable development of China-US economic and trade relations is in the fundamental interest of both nations and peoples, which is also conducive to global economic development, according to the white paper titled "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-US Economic and Trade Relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the white paper came on the same day steep US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, Beijing and Washington can resolve differences in economic and trade areas through equal-footed dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal-footed dialogue should constitute the fundamental approach in addressing problems between major countries, the white paper said, adding that mutually beneficial cooperation can help the two countries realise their respective development goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The white paper noted the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will damage its own and others' interests, and is a severe violation of World Trade Organization rules that damages the multilateral trading system and erodes the legitimate rights and interests of the parties affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the United States, weaken its industrial base, aggravate panic in the financial market and increase the risk of US economic recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "History has repeatedly taught the lesson that trade protectionism will not help strengthen a country's domestic economy," the white paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it will do severe damage to world trade and investment, which could trigger a global economic and financial crisis, with the inevitable consequences for oneself and others." (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Social worker jailed over riot conviction in retrial

<img alt="The District Court has also sentenced three other defendants in the same retrial. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799588_1_20250409141131.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social worker Jackie Chen was on Wednesday handed a three-year, nine-month prison sentence after being convicted of rioting during the 2019 unrest in a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chen was accused of taking part in a riot on August 31, 2019, when protesters used debris to set up roadblocks in Wan Chai and clashed with police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, a District Court judge acquitted her and ruled that she had no case to answer, before the Department of Justice lodged an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeal later ordered a retrial of four defendants, including Chen. She was the only one out of the four to not plead guilty in the retrial.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, Deputy District Judge May Chung said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung noted that while there was no evidence showing the four defendants were leading the charge in the riot, some of them had brought gear such as masks and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also said Chen had voiced support for the gathering crowd at the scene and encouraged the riot – not the lowest level of participation in the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she decided to reduce the jail term by 10 months for all four defendants, after noting they were under stress from the five-year-long proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others in the case each received a jail term of two years and five months after pleading guilty.

    Risk-off mode on as new US duties curb appetites

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index has been volatile amid a tit-for-tat tariffs fight that may escalate even further after Donald Trump's 50 percent levy takes effect on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799583_1_20250409143912.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 50 percent in extra US duties levied on imports from China on Wednesday have further accelerated deleveraging by investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  That comes as part of a risk-off mode taken by investors following escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, according to financial experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they warned that those investors who saw market downturns as an opportunity and went along with market momentum could find themselves on the short end of the stick as a result of volatilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,815 at the noon trading break, just as the new tariffs by the United States took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decline marked the index's lowest level since January 23, while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1 percent and mainland shares also returned to the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter which market you are talking about, they cannot avoid the three 'T's, which are Trump, trade and tariffs," said Feng Shuyan, an independent portfolio manager, who previously worked with Chubb investment management as associate general manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the latest market trend reflected the rather bearish sentiment among investors, which sped up ongoing deleveraging, and that such a downward trend might continue in the SAR given it is a free port.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre and is more correlated to global stock market performance," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, it will probably experience lots of volatilities, you will ride roller coasters, as the volatility, the deleveraging, the liquidation process will continue to bite," she told RTHK, adding that institutional investors' reductions on risk assets will further weigh on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cash is king, so maybe place a safe bet, " she advised investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, James Wong, chief executive of Almagest Asset Management, said the latest market retreat came amid speculation over the so-called "Mar-a-Lago Accord", a phrase coined last year that refers to efforts to weaken the US dollar and thereby reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market participants tend to think that the US is going to have this tariff coalition, and the receiving end of that coalition is going to be China, so it's going to be a duel between two giants now," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, I think none of the market participants are eager to get into the market and the short-term fluctuations are hardly indicators that can help us judge what is the general flow of capital and where the market is heading."
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggests investors stay calm and not chase the momentum to avoid a "1929 incident", which saw a market crash on Wall Street that year and led to the largest recession in modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you're chasing momentum, chances are you are going to be played out by the volatility," he said, noting that other assets such as bonds from Australia could instead be favoured by investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What could happen next is going to be very, very messy, in our opinion, and the general direction is that the capital markets is going down for a prolonged period."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Train services between Tung Chung and Sunny Bay will end earlier next Saturday to make way for track diversion work as part of the line's extension, MTR officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 19, Tung Chung Line services will conclude two hours earlier at 11pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free shuttle buses will be provided for people to travel between the two stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The railway company said the last train from Tung Chung to Hong Kong station will depart at 11.01pm, while the final train from Hong Kong to Tung Chung will leave at 11:07pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Lui, MTR's chief of airport segment, said 100 extra staff will be deployed to help passengers along the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any unexpected situations like severe weather, our team will work quickly to fix it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If these issues might affect train services the next day, we will communicate through the news media and social media as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension project, which includes building a new Tung Chung East station, is expected to finish by 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR said foundation work for the new station has been completed and everything is progressing well.

    Shai holds court as Lakers sink after Doncic ejection

<img alt="Oklahoma City Thunder guards shut down Pau Gasol of the Los Angeles Lakers in the midst of a shot. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799573_1_20250409122147.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 42 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder bounced back to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 136-120 in a hard-fought battle that saw Luka Doncic controversially ejected in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after suffering a 27-point defeat to the Lakers, the No 1-ranked Thunder avenged that loss on Tuesday thanks to Gilgeous-Alexander's 13th 40-point game of the season, with Jalen Williams adding 26 and Lugentz Dort 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest pivoted on the fourth quarter incident that led to the Lakers' Slovenian star Doncic picking up a second technical foul and being tossed from the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic was ejected following a one-handed jump shot that put the Lakers 108-107 up with 7min 40sec remaining after officiating crew member J T Orr judged he had been verbally abused by the player following the bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic protested, arguing he had merely been responding to a fan at courtside who had heckled him, but the decision stood and clearly rattled the Lakers, allowing the Thunder to seize the initiative and pull away for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great game that unfortunately didn't get the finish that I think every basketball fan would want because of some decision making on some individuals' parts," Lakers coach J J Redick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James, who finished with 28 points, was at a loss to explain Doncic's ejection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why the ref was taking it personal," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ref took it upon himself to think it was versus him. The game was just weird as hell after that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic insisted he had not been trash-talking Orr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nothing to do with the ref, so I didn't really understand it," Doncic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, but you know that's on me too. I can't let my team down like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers remain in third place with a 48-31 record and need to win two of their remaining three regular-season fixtures to lock in third seeding in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers clinched N.1 seeding in the NBA Eastern Conference playoffs after cruising past the Chicago Bulls 135-113.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland led the scoring with 28 points in a balanced offensive performance from the Cavs, who improved to 63-16 to ensure they will finish the regular season on top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensures Cleveland will have home advantage when the playoffs get under way next week following the completion of the regular season on Sunday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said new construction technologies can speed up housing projects and that residents living in substandard subdivided flats will not go homeless amid policy changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided flats last year, saying they will be replaced by basic housing units, each of which must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Ho said residents of substandard subdivided units do not have to worry about relocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's say one third of the subdivided flats have to be redesigned," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the supply of public housing units will increase in the future, and we will have 21,000 transitional flats and 30,000 light public flats
  <br>
  <br>
  "These flats will help to accommodate some 30,000 households in subdivided flats who have to be relocated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she believes new construction technologies can help speed up housing projects, such as the modular integrated construction method being used to build transitional housing and light public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she has had exchanges with experts on the mainland and that their new technologies could help the construction sector of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more and more robotic arms being used," she pointed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing are structural steel projects, so welding is an important procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Robotic arms are used for welding, and the efficiency, accuracy and safety are a lot better than doing it manually."

    HK exporters 'furious over Trump tariffs'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A commercial-sector lawmaker said on Wednesday US President Donald Trump's tariffs on China are an act of bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump will impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese imports at around noon Hong Kong time on top of 54 percent levies, bringing the total to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam, who is also an executive councillor, told an RTHK radio programme that manufacturers and exporters in Hong Kong who mainly do businesses with the United States were furious about the move and felt powerless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies now face a situation where they have many batches of completed goods that cannot be shipped, and they're unable to collect payment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because, normally speaking, when a customer places an order, companies can only collect payment when the goods have been shipped and have a shipping order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As they cannot collect the payment, there is a great impact on their cash flow."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that companies have to be united and not be cowed, saying that will get them through this difficult period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam pointed out that firms have reached a critical point, as they still have to settle operating costs, such as wages and rents amid their cash-flow struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker called on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to roll out measures to help support small and medium-sized companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include extending a payments moratorium on principals for 12 months and offering flexible arrangements for firms to repay loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though the industry has been trading in the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets in the past two years, Lam said combined sales from the two places are still lower than US turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that opening up new markets takes time and that they won't be able to replace the US market at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Willy Lin, chairman of Hong Kong Shippers' Council told the same programme that companies in Hong Kong cannot do much even if they have already set up factories in various places, like Southeast Asia, as many of those countries have been  hit by Trump's levies.

<img alt="HKTDC's Irina Fan says Hong Kong's diversified trade links will help it withstand any pressure from new US tariffs. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799560_1_20250409111312.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leung Chai-yan, the elder daughter of former SAR chief executive CY Leung, has died at the age of 33.
 <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the news on social media early on Wednesday, the former SAR leader said his daughter passed away "very suddenly".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Chai-yan "left without saying a word" and passed away peacefully in bed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thanks to police and forensic investigations, we can rule out suicide and other suspicious circumstances at the moment," Leung wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are grateful for the concern, understanding and sympathy from all our friends during this most difficult time for our family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report of a woman found unresponsive at a Shau Kei Wan serviced apartment complex on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman was certified dead at the scene, according to the force.

    Zverev suffers shock exit at Monte-Carlo Masters

<img alt="Alexander Zverev crashed out in his opening match against Italy's Matteo Berrettini. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799545_1_20250409100453.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top seed Alexander Zverev crashed out in his opening match of the Monte-Carlo Masters with Italy's Matteo Berrettini as defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and Britain's Jack Draper both advanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Zverev has struggled for any kind of form since his defeat by Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final at the end of January, winning just six of 12 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with a first-round bye in the absence of world number one Sinner, who is suspended for a doping violation until May 4, Zverev was among the favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a controlled start to the game, the German slumped to a 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 defeat to 34th-ranked Berrettini, at the end of a high-flying match, which had included an impressive 48-stroke rally won by the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been the worst period since my injury [the] last few months," said Zverev who has suffered a string of early exits of late, including at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a great first set, and once I got broken in the second set I play ten levels down. My ball is much slower. I stopped hitting the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same story the last few months. Nothing changes. So it's me who lost the match, once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought my level was terrible, but that's just my opinion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion and three-time Monte Carlo winner Tsitsipas advanced past 38th-ranked Australian Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a lacklustre US tour, the Dubai winner won through 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in his second round tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Wells champion Draper, seeded fifth, eased past 45th-ranked American Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-1.
  <br>

  Novak Djokovic – the winner in 2013 and 2015 – and Carlos Alcaraz start their campaigns on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An 88th-minute Davide Frattesi goal took Inter Milan to a 2-1 win at Bayern Munich, giving the Italians the edge after the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Undermanned Bayern, nursing a bulging casualty ward, set the tone in the first half-hour on Tuesday, with Michael Olise and Harry Kane narrowly failing to break through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter opened the scoring on the 38-minute mark when Marcus Thuram's clever back-heel found Lautaro Martinez who blasted home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italians maintained control until Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller, days after announcing a summer departure after 25 years at the club, scored the equaliser with a typical poacher's finish with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not content to be spectators to a Bayern fairytale ending, Inter broke on the counter just three minutes later, with Carlos Augusto finding Frattesi, who scored Inter's second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter, defeated in the final by Manchester City two seasons ago, have their noses in front in their bid to make the last four of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter goalscorer Martinez toasted the "complete performance", telling Amazon Prime his side showed "character, personality", adding "the boys showed what they were made of".
  <br>
  <br>
  The late goal consigned Bayern to their first home defeat in the Champions League since 2021, a run of 22 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Champions League winner Mueller lamented Inter's "stupid" late goal, saying "when we watch the footage, when we analyse it, we'll know we could have done better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't a brutal defeat. We've played the first half, the first leg – we imagined a different result but we know there's still something in it for us." (AFP)

    Arsenal stun Real Madrid with Rice's free-kick magic

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal defied the odds with their stunning 3-0 win against Real Madrid as Declan Rice's free-kick magic left the Champions League holders in disarray.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rice inspired one of the greatest results in Arsenal's storied history with two blistering free-kicks in the second half of the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the third goal for Arteta's side as they moved within touching distance of a first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an incredible moment for England midfielder Rice, who had never scored a free-kick in his career – a period spanning 338 previous matches – before the first of his thunderbolts flashed past Real keeper Thibaut Courtois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had also failed to find the net from a direct set-piece in almost four years, with their last coming via Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunners captain Odegaard put his hands on his head in disbelief when Rice completed his set-piece double, while Arteta was equally surprised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Declan's been very determined because we have said in the last few months that we have not scored a direct free-kick in three-and-half years," the Arsenal manager said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and of that quality from the same player, a player that has never scored a free-kick before in his career, what are the odds?
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a player who can do it, how clean he strikes it it's Declan. But you have to execute it at the highest level. And against one of the best keepers in the world as well. It's amazing."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a cathartic result for Arsenal, who have endured a rocky season marred by their failure to keep pace with Liverpool in the Premier League title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are 11 points adrift of Liverpool, leaving the Champions League as their last chance this season to win a first trophy since the 2020 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Few would have expected them to get past 15-time European champions Real before the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  But now Arsenal will travel to the Bernabeu for the return tie next week as firm favourites to progress to a last four clash against Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa. (AFP)

 Mainland and Hong Kong shares fell at the open on Wednesday as the US trade war escalated, following Washington's decision to impose 104 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, starting around noon, Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index sank 3.14 percent, or 632 points, to 19,494, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.13 percent, or 35 points, to 3,110.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese state holding companies continued to support the stock market by increasing share investment, while a slew of listed firms announced share buybacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the region, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index initially lost nearly four percent on opening, and markets in South Korea, New Zealand and Australia also declined.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US media giant Comcast Corp will build its first Universal theme park and resort in Europe in Bedford, north of London, opening in 2031, the British government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park will create 20,000 jobs during construction and a further 8,000 jobs across the hospitality and creative industries when it opens, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected to attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year, a number currently only exceeded in Europe by Disneyland Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios has five resorts and parks in the US states of California and Florida as well as in Singapore, Japan and China, offering rides and attractions based on Jurassic Park, Harry Potter and other movie franchises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has sought to ease planning demands to boost investment in Britain, said in a statement the multi-billion pound investment would make Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plans for the site include a theme park, featuring several themed lands, a 500-room hotel and a retail, dining and entertainment complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh showed Starmer the plan in London on Tuesday, saying he "could not be more excited" to create a Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast bought a 500-acre former brickworks in Bedfordshire, about 55 miles north of London, in 2023. It already owns Sky, which is Europe's biggest pay-TV business.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had been in talks with the British government since last year about turning the site into a theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park and resort are subject to planning permission, the government said. (Reuters)

    Trump's sweeping global tariffs take effect

<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal over tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799523_1_20250409074554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

    Trump signs order to 'turbocharge' coal mining in US

<img alt="President Trump speaks next to coal industry workers, on the day he signs energy-related executive orders at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799521_1_20250409073316.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed executive orders to "turbocharge coal mining" in the country, seeking to "more than double" electricity production to keep up with power-hungry artificial intelligence technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The executive orders, which Trump signed surrounded by miners in hard hats, will lift regulatory barriers to coal extraction and suspend the planned closures of numerous coal-fired power plants across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will end the government bias against coal," said the Republican, who instructed the Department of Justice to identify and fight any state or local regulations that were "putting our coal miners out of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that it would be "possible to extract enormous amounts of critical minerals and rare earths, which, you know, we need for technology and high technology in the process of coal mining."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lena Moffitt, director of the climate NGO Evergreen, criticised the president in a statement for using artificial intelligence as "a cover to bail out his fossil fuel donors with the dirtiest, most expensive power source on the grid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Production of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, has fallen sharply in the United States over the last 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, coal accounted for just over 16 percent of total electricity production, outstripped by renewable energies at just over 21 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long been a sceptic of climate change, and since his return to the White House has set about boosting fossil fuels through deregulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, his administration announced a wave of environmental rollbacks targeting the green policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the most significant of them was revisiting a 2024 rule that requires coal-fired plants to eliminate nearly all their carbon emissions or commit to shutting down altogether, a cornerstone of Biden's climate agenda. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers raced to find survivors on Tuesday among the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub where at least 98 people, including a Major League Baseball star, were killed when the roof collapsed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was on stage at the popular Jet Set nightclub when the roof caved in shortly after midnight, was one of those caught up in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers said the 69-year-old was among dozens of people trapped in the rubble, some of whom were heard crying for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Dominican media outlets later reported that Perez had been found dead but Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Centre, said forensics experts had "not confirmed that they found the body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was 51-year-old retired MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who won a World Series in 2011 with the St Louis Cardinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued alive but died of his injuries while being taken to hospital, local media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when disaster struck shortly at 12:44 am local time. The club has capacity for 700 people seated and about 1,000 people standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured to hospital, as scores of people gathered outside the venue desperately seeking news of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll started at 15 and kept rising throughout the day. By evening it had reached 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Abinader visited the scene and declared three days of national mourning. (AFP)

<img alt="US stocks have been in free fall since Trump's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799508_1_20250409051017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled again on Tuesday as initially successful efforts to rebound from big losses faded amid worries over US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent to 4,982, its first close below 5,000 points in nearly a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended down 0.8 percent at 37,645, a swing of about 1,780 points below its session peak, while the Nasdaq shed 2.2 percent to 15,267.
  <br>
  <br>
  After three days of losses, Wall Street stocks opened buoyantly as traders embraced talk of White House negotiations with Japan and South Korea in the hopes Trump's trade onslaught might be short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investors grew edgy as the day progressed with no concrete progress. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed plans for massive tariffs on China to go into effect overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously investors are clamouring for clarity and there still isn't any," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, who estimated that the market now sees a greater than 50 percent chance of a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's "Liberation Day" event announcing tariffs on major US trading partners last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials have signalled openness to dealmaking while blasting China for enacting sharp retaliatory tariffs in response to the new US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump plans to impose another 50 percent duty on Chinese goods at midnight, bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished the day in the red, while most of the Dow was also in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Especially big losers in the blue-chip index included Apple, down five percent and Nike, down 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But UnitedHealth Group surged 5.4 percent after the Trump administration finalised a rule boosting payments to insurers under the government Medicare programme. (AFP)

    Grand National winning jockey Mullins suspended

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Mullins has been given an eight-day suspension after he was found to have breached whip rules when riding Nick Rockett to Grand National glory on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish amateur rider steered the eight-year-old to victory in the celebrated steeplechase at the Aintree course in Liverpool to complete a notable family double, given 33-1 shot Nick Rockett is trained by his father, Willie Mullins.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the race, Willie Mullins, who achieved the impressive feat of saddling the first three home in the world's most famous jumps race, in addition to being the father of the winning rider, said: "This is the best day ever, this will never be topped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary officials, however, found Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Grand National is deemed to be a Class One race under British rules, the usual penalty of four days for such an offence was doubled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Mullins was, therefore, suspended for eight days in April and May.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result of the Grand National remained unaltered, however, as is often the case with whip offences in British horseracing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a situation critics believe encourages jockeys to break the rules, particularly in showpiece races such as the Grand National, rather than face the possible anger of owners, trainers and punters who might otherwise claim their horse has not been 'ridden out' fully in a finish. (AFP)

 The Denver Nuggets, mired in a four-game losing streak as the NBA playoffs approach, fired coach Michael Malone on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Malone led the Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023, but despite the exploits of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets have struggled for consistency this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are fourth in a tight Western Conference race with four teams just a half-game behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Denver Nuggets have relieved head coach Michael Malone of his duties and will not extend general manager Calvin Booth," the Nuggets said in a statement, adding that assistant coach David Adelman will assume head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets have three games remaining in the regular season, which concludes on Sunday. (AFP)

 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become "a killing field," blaming Israel for blocking aid and failing in its "unequivocal obligations" to meet the needs of the Palestinian territory's residents.

  "More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened," Guterres said in remarks to journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of people in war, he emphasised the obligation of the "occupying power" to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of that is happening today. No humanitarian supplies can enter Gaza," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli authorities newly proposed 'authorisation mechanisms' for aid delivery risk further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referencing recent Israeli proposals over controlling aid into Gaza, which a UN source said included monitoring calories to prevent misuse by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let me be clear – we will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality," he said, demanding guarantees for the unhindered entry of aid to the coastal territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guterres also raised the alarm about the situation in the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The current path is a dead end – totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes it even worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to end the dehumanisation, protect civilians, release the hostages, ensure lifesaving aid, and renew the ceasefire." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday described Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, as "truly a moron" in a growing rift over Donald Trump's tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a key aide to the president, has signalled his opposition to the tariffs, and the Tesla CEO hit out after Navarro described his electric vehicle company as "not a car manufacturer" but "a car assembler."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's new tariffs on imports have roiled markets as fears of a global recession rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted his criticism on X under a clip of Navarro saying Tesla imported batteries, electronics and tyres, and that Musk "wants the cheap foreign parts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk fired back, saying that "Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man recently backed a free-trade zone between North America and Europe – a wish at odds with Trump's flagship tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has ruled out any pause in his aggressive stance despite retaliatory action from China and signs of criticism from within his Republican Party. (AFP)

    Referees to wear body cameras at Club World Cup

<img alt="During this year's competition refs will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799493_1_20250408234007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Referees at this year's Club World Cup will be equipped with body cameras and instructed to implement new rules to cut down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, Fifa announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by Ifab, the sport's lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the offence is rarely penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13. (AFP)

<img alt="Rescue staff find a survivor at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799484_1_20250408221231.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers were on Tuesday racing to find survivers among the rubble of a Dominican Republic night club where at least 18 people died and dozens were hurt in an early-morning roof collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 400 rescue personnel were at the Jet Set nightclub in the Caribbean nation's capital Santo Domingo, authorities said, with dozens of ambulances on standby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof came down following a sudden blackout during a performance by renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was also trapped in the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, who died of her injuries in hospital, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have 18 dead; we continue working with the various institutions that are part of the national emergency center," Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center (COE), told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendez said rescuers could hear people in the rubble crying out for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there have been 121 trips to hospital with between "two and three" injured people per ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people," Mendez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez's daughter Zulinka said the singer, 69, was still at the scene of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if they have him in an ambulance because they're not letting me through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media published images of a construction crane at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are rescuing all the people we can save alive and recovering those bodies we find along the way. But we have focused on people we can rescue alive because we hear them asking for help," Mendez said of the ongoing operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abinader said on X the government has "been following the case minute by minute since it happened," before rushing to the scene himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main objective is to save lives... We are deeply affected," he said on his arrival. (AFP)

    Fans delight as Coldplay kick off HK tour

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium on Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show marked the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because it might be the last concert they have in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’”
  <br>
  <br>
  She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of reselling tickets at inflated prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

    Tram fares to go up on May 12

<img alt="Tram fares for those aged 12 and above will rise by 30 cents to HK$3.30. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799459_1_20250408181035.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise comes after the Executive Council approved an application from Hong Kong Tramways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the new fare will be HK$3.30, or 10 percent more, for those aged 12 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rise will be steeper for the elderly, as their new fare of HK$1.50 is an increase of 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children aged between three and eleven will pay HK$1.60, or a rise of nearly 7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The price for monthly tickets will stay the same at HK$260.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said a number of factors were considered as part of the vetting process, such as rising operating costs, the quality and quantity of service provided and public acceptability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government considered the fare increase necessary for maintaining stable operation, and that [its] proposed level of increase is acceptable," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the fare increase, the tramway remains the most economical means of transportation serving the northern shore of Hong Kong Island."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they'll continue to work with the company and encourage it to find different sources of revenue, especially tying in with its concept of "tourism everywhere" and preserving its historical value.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last fare increase for trams was in July 2022, when different classes of charges also rose by up to around 15 percent.
