<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers has blasted off on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles .
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Chun, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit on Monday night from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX’s Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight .
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang won’t say how much he paid Elon Musk’s SpaceX for the three-and-a-half day ultimate polar adventure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of their flight – from Florida to the South Pole – took barely half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the targeted altitude of some 440 kilometres, their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly one-and-a-half  hours, including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trip is also about “pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge,” he said ahead of the flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew plans two dozen experiments – including taking the first human X-rays in space – and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first woman in space, the Soviet Union’s Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ship's wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after US tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musk’s company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman is now in the running for NASA’s top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so “normal people” without traditional aerospace backgrounds can “hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and his crew view the polar flight as like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, I’m happy to see that,” Wang said via X last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said he's been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, he’s visited more than half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arranged it so that liftoff would mark his 1,000th flight. (AP)

    Dongjiang water fuels HK's economic miracle: Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Dongjiang water has fuelled Hong Kong's economic miracle, contributing to the city's sustainable development and long-term prosperity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the International Water Pioneers Summit, Lee said the SAR's water supply is closely tied to the mainland, with 70 to 80 percent of water coming from the Dongjiang River.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum brings together around 400 officials, academics and water experts from around the world to discuss new opportunities in waterworks development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is one of transformation, illustrating how a city with limited water resource, can turn geographic and resource limitations into engineering triumphs," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is also one of deep and abiding ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because without the strong bonds and blood relation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the engineering, and the water it made possible, would not have taken place."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that the water supply capacity increased twelvefold from 68.2 million to 820 million cubic metres with expansions of the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted Hong Kong's vision to become an international infrastructure centre, adding that the Digital Water Office was set up last year to invest in innovative solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same forum, Minister of Water Resources Li Guoying said Beijing is committed to supporting the SAR's water supply despite the growing threat coming as a result of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will actively support Hong Kong in leveraging its unique advantages of having the motherland's backing while being connected to the world, fully playing its role as a bridge and window to share water management concepts, experiences and solutions with countries worldwide," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong, meanwhile, outlined plans to enhance cooperation with Hong Kong in water management through technological innovation, particularly in AI applications.

<img alt="The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong has accused the US of slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798399_1_20250401103258.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has warned of "strong and resolute" countermeasures against fresh sanctions imposed on six mainland and Hong Kong officials by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong accused Washington of smearing the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and a serious violation of the principles of international law and the basic norms governing international relations," a statement by the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said the move to impose sanctions has once again exposed Washington's "evil intentions" of undermining the SAR's prosperity and stability, as well as containing China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will surely take strong and resolute countermeasures," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the officials sanctioned are Dong Jingwei, the director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; justice chief Paul Lam; and outgoing police commissioner Raymond Siu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR police have taken lawful actions against overseas anti-China rioters, and the SAR judicial authorities have independently and impartially tried national security cases following legal procedures," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These acts are consistent with international law and customary practice, and are just and necessary moves to safeguard national security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US also condemned the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese central government resolutely supports the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Hong Kong SAR in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that undermine national security," the embassy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to respect the facts, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop smearing Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law."

    Bangkok reviews construction safety in quake aftermath

<img alt="Satellite images of the tower in Bangkok taken on December 25 and after its collapse on Friday. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798389_1_20250401094853.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities said they were investigating why a single office tower block under construction in Bangkok collapsed during Friday's earthquake that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the site on Monday as heavy equipment pulled away rubble from the 30-storey State Audit Office building in hopes of finding the 78 people still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even one life saved is worth all the effort, so I think we have to move on, carry on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, where millions of people live and work in thousands of high-rise buildings, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude 7.7 quake, which was centred more than 1,200 km away, killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most of them at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations," Chadchart said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, fell 27 percent in trading on Monday as questions were raised about the building's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the Chinese contractor building the State Audit Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose family owns one of Thailand’s largest construction conglomerates, said he has ordered an investigation committee to be set up and to report the results back to him within seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to three possible factors behind the collapse: the designer, the inspectors or the builders. (AP)

    Impeachment crunch time for Yoon on Friday

<img alt="Yoon Suk-yeol will learn whether he has the top job in South Korea come Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798397_1_20250401101622.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Constitutional Court said it will rule on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It has been deliberating on Yoon’s political fate over his ill-fated imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the US dollar after the announcement of the ruling date.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market's benchmark KOSPI was up 1.5 percent after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when six or more judges agree, according to South Korea's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whatever decision is, it will likely deepen domestic divisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millions have rallied in Seoul and elsewhere to support or denounce Yoon in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they’ll mobilise all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly in December voted to impeach Yoon, a conservative, leaving his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing a separate criminal trial after he was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January on rebellion charges in connection with his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court’s endorsement of Yoon’s impeachment would officially drive him out of office and prompt a national election within two months to find a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it overturns Yoon’s impeachment, he would immediately return to his presidential duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the matter is Yoon’s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials have said Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon argues that he didn’t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the “wickedness” of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn’t in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party-led impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing parliament's activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>
  No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980. (AP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 97.53 points, or 0.42 percent, to open at 23,217.11 points on Tuesday, as the market prepares for more news about US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day" and has pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, a private-sector survey has shown that mainland factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in March, buoyed by stronger demand and robust export orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.2 last month from 50.8 in February. That was higher than analyst expectations of 51.1. A number above 50 signals growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebound broadly aligned with an official PMI released on Monday that showed manufacturing activity growing at its quickest rate in a year. (with additional reporting by agencies)

 A peace agreement on ending the conflict in Ukraine should be fair, binding and acceptable to all parties involved, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in remarks published on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We advocate eradicating the causes of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations, ultimately achieving a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved, which would make it possible to achieve truly lasting peace and stability in Eurasia and throughout the world," Wang told the Russian RIA state news agency in an interview.

  Wang is on a three-day visit to Moscow for strategic cooperation talks, surrounded by uncertainty around the partial ceasefire in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump striking a critical tone against the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  China calls for the peace talks to continue, Wang told RIA in a wide-ranging interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The step towards peace, although not that big, is constructive - it's worth building on it," Wang said. "With peace, it is no pain no gain. You need to work hard to achieve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Russia and the United States had taken the first step toward normalising relations, "which is good for stabilising the balance of power between major powers and inspires optimism in a disappointing international situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Russia declared a "no limits" strategic partnership days before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Monday that Putin would receive Wang, who would also hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang reiterated to RIA that Beijing is ready to play a role in settling the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready, taking into account the aspirations of the parties involved, to play a constructive role in the settlement together with the international community, primarily with the countries of the Global South," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has been pushing for a greater involvement of China in peace talks since the early days of the war, which marked its third anniversary in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has proposed on its own, and together with Brazil, general principles to end the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Russia and China bear a special responsibility to maintain world peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our countries, as each other's largest neighbouring states, world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace and development throughout the world," Wang said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar will mark a minute of silence on Tuesday in tribute to victims of the country's devastating earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people, as hopes dim of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive quake, the ruling junta said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of a week of national mourning, the junta announced the minute's silence to begin Tuesday at 12:51:02 pm - the precise time the 7.7-magnitude quake struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  People should stop where they are to pay respect to the victims, the junta said, while media should halt broadcasting and show mourning symbols, and prayers will be offered at temples and pagodas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said Monday that 2,056 have now been confirmed dead, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 still missing, but the toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three Chinese nationals are said to be among the dead, along with two French people.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 19 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diggers continue to clear the vast pile of rubble at the site, where a dozen deaths have been confirmed and at least 75 people are still unaccounted for. Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States said on Monday it had dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck on Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the "gains were too few and the costs were too high," after cutting more than 80 percent of its projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. (AFP)

    Nasa's astronauts speak after unexpected stay in space

<img alt="Nasa astronauts, from left - Nick Hague, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore - speak out for the first time since their return to Earth. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798377_1_20250401090640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said on Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their extended stay in space and would fly on Boeing's Starliner again.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing, which returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore didn't shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing's bungled test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he'd go back up “in a heartbeat.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. “We're all in,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not for pointing fingers,” Wilmore said. “It's just to make the path clearer going forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space - 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go," Wilmore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency may require another test flight - with cargo - before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year's end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Starliner’s rocky road, Nasa officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing US companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs. (AP)

    Trump task force to review Harvard's funding

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvard University has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s approach to fight campus anti-semitism, with the announcement of a new “comprehensive review” that could jeopardise billions of dollars for the Ivy League college.
 <br>
  <br>
  A federal anti-semitism task force is reviewing more than US$255 million in contracts between Harvard and the federal government to make sure the school is following civil rights laws, the administration announced on Monday. The government also will examine US$8.7 billion in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same task force cut US$400 million from Columbia University and threatened to slash billions more if it refused a list of demands from President Donald Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columbia agreed to many of the changes this month, drawing praise from some Jewish groups and condemnation from free speech groups, who see it as a stunning intrusion by the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of other universities have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they could face similar treatment over allegations of anti-semitism. The federal government is a major provider of revenue for American universities through grants for scientific research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Harvard symbolises the American Dream, but has jeopardised its reputation by “promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry” and failing to protect students from anti-semitism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged that anti-semitism exists even on his campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said Harvard has done much to fight it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard will ensure the government has a full account of the university's work, Garber said. If federal funding is pulled, he added, it will “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker player Ng On-yee on Monday defeated World No. 1 Mink Nutcharut of Thailand to defend her title at the British Open in Walsall, England.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng's 4-3 victory is the SAR athlete's second ranking crown of the season, following her dominance at the US Women's Snooker Open in August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also solidifies her hold on second place in the world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng, 34, has now claimed 22 ranking titles since her maiden victory in 2012, when she won the Northern Championship without losing a frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was close to her best throughout the tournament, having scored four of the top five breaks – including a near-flawless century break of 113 during her quarter-final victory against compatriot So Man-yan on Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 wounded in the Palestinian territory in the past 10 days, UNICEF said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures include children who were reportedly killed or wounded when the surgical department of Al Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza, was hit in an attack on March 23, the UN children's agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF said most of these children were displaced, and sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas, Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell added: "All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children."
  <br>
  <br>
  The UNICEF statement said that after nearly 18 months of war, more than 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children have been displaced repeatedly and denied basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF called for an end to hostilities and for Israel to end its ban on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which has been in force since March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said children who are sick or wounded should be evacuated to receive medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths," UNICEF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must not stand by and allow the killing and suffering of children to continue," it added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Tuesday condemned the United States after the US put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said the move exposed US barbarity under its hegemony. It also said it would not be intimidated and that SAR officials would continue to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials concerned are Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; Paul Lam, the Secretary for Justice; Raymond Siu, the Police Commissioner; Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the committee for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong; Dick Wong, assistant commissioner of the police - national security; and Margaret Chiu, assistant commissioner of police - national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact is that the US has been ignoring the non-interference principle under international law, interfering with other countries' internal affairs, grooming agents, instigating 'colour revolutions', creating social unrest and multiple humanitarian disasters through economic and military coercion, causing suffering to people in many countries," an SAR government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, those who are suspected to have committed offences endangering national security and absconded overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the US State Department accused the officials of using Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially in relation to 19 people who had fled overseas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major League Baseball has suspended Atlanta Braves slugger Jurickson Profar for 80 games after he tested positive for the performance-enhancing chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), MLB announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspension of the 32-year-old outfielder is more bad news for an Atlanta team that has started the season 0-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  He signed a three-year, US$42 million deal with the Braves in January, and will be suspended through the end of June. Although he can return in July for the remainder of the regular season, Profar will not be eligible to play in the 2025 postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that Jurickson Profar tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program," the Braves said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar, who hit a career-high 24 home runs for the San Diego Padres last year, issued a statement through the MLB Players Association, calling the announcement "the most difficult day of my baseball career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar wrote in a statement that he tested positive in the off-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to apologise to the entire Braves organisation, my teammates, and the fans," he said. He added that he "would never knowingly do anything to cheat" and that he "would never willingly take a banned substance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I take full responsibility and accept MLB's decision," he concluded. (AFP)

    Trump will 'be kind' over further tariffs this week

<img alt="US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798346_1_20250401021518.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be "very kind" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump - who has been making unprecedented use of presidential powers since taking office in January - said he could announce as early as Tuesday night exactly what "reciprocal tariffs" will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been "ripped off by every country in the world," promising "Liberation Day" for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for details, he told reporters Monday: "You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added: "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said on Monday that he was not worried his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, President Trump downplayed risks that TikTok was in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he was confident of finding a buyer for the app's US business by a Friday deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it, because they may have something to do with it," he said, adding "I'd like to see TikTok remain alive." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were dealt a major blow with leading scorer Erling Haaland set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury as the season reaches its climax.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Norwegian was injured in Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having just scored his 30th goal of the season to level the tie, he was then hurt in a challenge with Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League champions did not provide a timescale for the player's return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expectation is that Erling will be fit in time to play a further part in the remainder of this season, including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup," said a club statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Erling underwent initial tests in Manchester on Monday morning and will now seek specialist consultation to confirm the full extent of the injury. Assessment remains ongoing to ascertain a full prognosis," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are currently fifth in the Premier League and battling to ensure a spot in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side face matches against Leicester and Manchester United this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then have a visit from Crystal Palace and a trip to Everton before their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, at Wembley on April 26. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana will all involve 23 teams from this year, with the initiative rubber-stamped by the International Cycling Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra teams come from extra wildcard invitations, an initiative proposed by the Professional Cycling Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of riders will shift from 176 under the 22-team model, to 184 with 23 teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UCI Management Committee has approved the request submitted by the PCC to increase the number of teams participating in the men's Grand Tours (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and La Vuelta a Espana) to 23," the UCI said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expansion aims to support second division teams, while enabling organisers to strengthen the line-up for their race and give riders from the additional teams the opportunity to compete in a Grand Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 18 top-tier World Tour teams take part in the Grand Tours, with extra invitations given to teams from the second-tier Pro Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tour de France organisers immediately announced their full line-up for the 2025 race with the top two Pro-Tour teams Lotto and Israel Premier Tech, plus three wild cards in Total Energies, Tudor Pro Cycling and Uno X Mobility. (AFP)

 Rory McIlroy has joined Tiger Woods in surpassing US$100 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, becoming just the second player to do so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Northern Irishman reached the landmark during the Houston Open over the past weekend, where a four-way tie for fifth netted him more than US$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, 35, has secured 28 victories out of 262 PGA Tour events since his debut in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods, now 49, crossed the US$100 million threshold in 2012 and has since accumulated US$120 million in prize money with 82 wins in 378 events. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off some early gloom about Donald Trump's imminent tariff announcement to close mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 bouncing into positive territory from a six-month low.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day," and pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the uncertainty, volatility surged in early trading on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index, colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumping more than 10 percent before cooling sharply as the day progressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an earlier decline to close up 1.0 percent at 42,001.76, as did the broad-based S&P 500 Index, which gained 0.6 percent to 5,611.85.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.1 percent to 17,299.29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the resurgence, the S&P posted its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [traders] were taking advantage of an oversold situation," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They still have another day in which to sort of play around," before Trump's big tariff announcement, Stovall added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Moderna fell 8.9 percent after the departure of a top US Food and Drug Administration official who disagreed with Trump's new health secretary, noted vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday reaffirmed its resolute opposition to moves that infringe upon and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonic practices or bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun made the remarks in response to a media query related to CK Hutchison's planned sale of certain port assets to a BlackRock-led group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have taken note of relevant reports," Guo said at a regular press briefing, adding that "the State Administration for Market Regulation is aware of the deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo emphasised that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion and bullying to infringe upon and undermine the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted another article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article quoted Hong Kong business and political figures as saying deals like this may involve national interests, and CK Hutchison should consider how its decision would impact the SAR and the country. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Kremlin says Putin 'remains open' to speaking to Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) earlier criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress on a ceasefire deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798328_1_20250331211156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday said that President Vladimir Putin was still "open" to speaking to Donald Trump after the US president said he was "very angry" with the Russian leader over little progress on a ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier criticised both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, as he pushes to end more than three years of conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told NBC he was "pissed off" at Putin for questioning Zelensky's credibility as someone to negotiate with and for calling for new authorities in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president remains open to contact with President Trump," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing call.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no phone call scheduled between the two leaders, but that one could be "organised promptly" if deemed "necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin earlier this month rejected a US proposal of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, that Zelensky backed, and has upped his rhetoric on Moscow wanting to install new leadership in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are continuing work.. Firstly, on developing bilateral relations and also working on implementing some ideas, linked to resolving the Ukrainian (conflict)," Peskov said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Work is ongoing. There is nothing concrete yet. This process is time-consuming, probably due to the fact of the complexity of the substance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, NBC News journalist Kristen Walker said Trump had called her to say he was angry with Putin and threatened tariffs on firms dealing with Russian oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later said he was "disappointed" with Putin for his comments on Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him," Trump said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A "megaquake" and subsequent tsunami could cause up to 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to US$2 trillion, the government said on Monday in a new estimate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures have been updated from a previous estimate, made in 2014, for the potential consequences of a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough south of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 800-kilometre undersea trench runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is "subducting" –  or slowly slipping – underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plates become stuck as they move, storing up vast amounts of energy that is released when they break free, causing potentially massive earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cabinet Office's disaster management working group said up to 215,000 people would be killed by a tsunami, 73,000 by the collapse of buildings and 9,000 by fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the predicted toll as a whole is lower than the 2014 estimate that said up to 323,000 people would die.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 1,400 years, megaquakes in the Nankai Trough have occurred every 100 to 200 years. The last one happened in 1946.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict quakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in January, a government panel said the probability of such a megaquake in the next 30 years has marginally increased, with a 75-82 percent chance of it happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first "megaquake advisory" under rules drawn up after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the likelihood of a new major earthquake along the Nankai Trough was higher than normal after a magnitude 7.1 jolt in southern Japan that injured 14 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advisory was lifted after a week but caused shortages of rice and other staples as people replenished their emergency stocks. (AFP)

    HA unveils smart measures to better monitor patients

<img alt="The Hospital Authority is bringing new technology to public hospitals. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798304_1_20250331180722.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday announced a series of smart measures in accident and emergency departments and wards to better monitor patients and reduce medical mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is a geofencing system aimed at preventing dementia patients from wandering off which will be used in all hospitals by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a patient with a special wristband walks too close to an exit door, an alarm will sound to alert hospital staff, said the authority's director of quality and safety Michael Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they get away from our accident and emergency departments, it will be very difficult for us to find them. And they might have some accident or deterioration during the missing period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the authority will expand its use of smart oxygen cylinders with alarms that activate when the main switch isn't turned on before use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the gas is nearly empty, it will also have an alarm. It will ensure that our staff will turn on the main switch and ensure that if the gas is running out, we will replace a new one as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authority is also implementing a new reporting system that will use AI and big data to analyse trends and patterns in medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can make use of the data to have early trending and to find out the common contributing factors to incidents so as to prevent future similar events from happening," said Raymond Cheung, a chief manager with the authority.

 Four of the world’s top football teams will be coming to Hong Kong this summer for pre-season friendlies as they gear up for the 2025-26 season, organisers said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  English Premier League giant Liverpool and Serie A side AC Milan will face off on July 26 for the Standard Chartered Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two other English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will meet on July 31, marking the first north London derby outside of the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two games will take place at the new 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium, with the retractable roof closed and air conditioning under each seat to make the upcoming hot and humid weather more bearable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rachael Carroll, managing director of TEG sport, organiser and promoter of the festival, said the Hong Kong Football Festival will attract at least 100,000 fans both locally and from outside the SAR, which will generate great value for the local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a wonderful opportunity to really launch Kai Tak Sports Park globally, really put this on the map, and these are fantastic rivalries and to have these two big matches, two great rivalries to really celebrate the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and have the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, we thought that that was appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course in the future, we would love to see international teams play local teams here in the market as well, so we think that this is going to be a great location for football in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser also said the three Premier League clubs will also hold open training sessions on July 24, 29 and 30 for fans to watch before the two exhibition matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ticket details will be announced shortly by the organiser.

    Retail sales slip again in February

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped by 13 percent year on year in February, partly due to high pre-festival spending from the Lunar New Year holiday falling in the same month last year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798288_1_20250331172638.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales suffered a notable decline last month, dropping by 13 percent year on year partially due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday showed that turnover of the city's total retail sales was provisionally estimated to be HK$29.4 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was significantly lower compared with HK$35.4 billion registered in January when sales dropped by 3.1 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking the first two months of the year together, the value retail sales were estimated to have decreased by 7.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volume of retail sales also notably declined, dropping by 15 percent, compared with the 5.1 percent retreat seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year, the total volume declined by 9.9 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the figures, a government spokesperson said the steep declines were partly due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in late January this year but in February last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumer spending in the local market normally attains a seasonal high before the festival," a government statement reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that when retail sales for the first two months of the year were bunched together, which could remove such a holiday effect, the decline was smaller compared with the drop in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the spokesperson acknowledged the challenges ahead but said various measures by the central and the SAR governments will offer support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government's proactive efforts to promote tourism and mega events, and the sustained increases in employment earnings in local labour market, would benefit the retail sector, though it would continue to face challenges from the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysed by categories, sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most significant decline – dropping by nearly 50 percent in the first two months of the year while that of furniture and fixtures decreased by 25.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, however, rose 0.7 percent year on year, followed closely by the 0.6 percent seen for medicines and cosmetics.

    Le Pen hit with immediate court ban on public office

<img alt="Marine Le Pen arrives in court for the verdict. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798290_1_20250331172739.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Monday banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office after her conviction over a fake jobs scheme, specifying that the sanction should come into force with immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling could mean that Le Pen will not be able to stand for president in 2027 elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  She left the courtroom after her conviction and this sanction were announced, but before the judge announced rulings on a potential prison sentence and fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court had earlier in the day found Le Pen guilty of misappropriating EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is the front-runner in opinion polls ahead of the 2027 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process, using a so-called "provisional execution" measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  An automatic five-year ban would hammer Le Pen, 56, a three-time presidential contender who has said 2027 will be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  She would retain her parliamentary seat until the end of her mandate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her "political death," alleging a plot to keep the National Rally from power that echoes claims made by US President Donald Trump about his legal woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, the National Rally and two dozen party figures were accused of diverting European parliament funds to pay France-based party staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants said the money was used legitimately and the allegations define too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.
  <br>
  <br>
  However judge Benedicte de Perthuis ruled: "It was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their [European Union] lawmaker had not given them any tasks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investigations also showed that these were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party's costs."  (Reuters)

    Myanmar marks quake with week of mourning

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's ruling junta declared a week of national mourning on Monday for the country's devastating earthquake, which has killed more than 1,700 people, as hopes faded of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive 7.7-magnitude quake, the junta said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is so dire that it's hard to express what is happening," said Aung Myint Hussein, chief administrator of Mandalay's Sajja North mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  People camped out in the streets across Mandalay overnight, either unable to return to ruined homes or nervous about the repeated aftershocks that rattled the city over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some had tents but many, including young children, simply bedded down on blankets in the middle of the roads, trying to keep as far from buildings as possible for fear of falling masonry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people are confirmed dead across Myanmar, according to the military junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more were injured and more than 300 remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 18 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with communications down in much of Myanmar, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge and the death toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mandalay's 1,000-bed general hospital has been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With temperatures forecast to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Monday, patients lay on gurneys in the hospital car park, many with only a thin tarpaulin rigged up to shield them from the fierce tropical sun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives did their best to comfort them, holding hands or waving bamboo fans over them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone," said one medic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to do what we can here. We are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sticky heat has exhausted rescue workers and accelerated body decomposition, which could complicate identification.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traffic began returning to the streets of Mandalay on Monday, and restaurants and street vendors resumed work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of Muslims gathered outside a destroyed mosque in the city for the first prayer of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that follows the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aftershocks rattled Mandalay over the weekend, several times sending residents fleeing into the streets in brief moments of panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenges facing the Southeast Asian country of more than 50 million people were immense even before the earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021, with its economy shattered and healthcare and infrastructure badly damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization declared the quake a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for more than US$100 million to help victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue teams have been arriving after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing made an exceptionally rare appeal for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, isolated Myanmar's ruling generals have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun thanked key allies China and Russia for their help, as well as India, and said the authorities were doing their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Bangkok, rain fell on Monday morning at the site of the collapsed building, where diggers continued to clear the vast pile of rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage, where 11 deaths have been confirmed and at least 76 people are still unaccounted for. (AFP)

 Hong Kong has become a lot cleaner in recent times with scores of rear lanes tidied up, dog mess issues resolved and waste dumping brought to an end in various locations, the government said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration said it has removed more than 600 sites from its "hygiene black spot" list after tackling issues that also included wild birds congregating, graffiti, rodent infestations, abandoned vehicles and shop front extensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only around 100 problem sites remain on the list that was first compiled in 2022, suffering from the above problems and other headaches such as illegally parked bicycles and dripping air-conditioners
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hygiene conditions at 94 percent (696) of the hygiene black spots on the list have been markedly improved and could be considered for removal from the black spot list," said Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's work on tackling hygiene black spots is ongoing. The departments concerned will continue to sustain their efforts and closely monitor the hygiene conditions of these spots. Prompt actions will be taken in case of any change of circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also expressed gratitude for efforts over the past two years to revamp the cityscape and hygiene conditions.

 Officials have brushed off concerns that landlords might be hesitant about getting their dwellings declared as basic housing units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, saying they would not consider extending a registration period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration on Monday also suggested the possibility of establishing a reporting mechanism on homes breaching such rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the government proposal, landlords will be given 12 months to register their properties before having three years to make necessary improvements to be certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why owners would not register if they intend to continue to operate," Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong told lawmakers when asked if registration numbers are low.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to extend the [registration] period... The consequence of not registering is serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  To be certified as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the administration is considering charging landlords by residential units and that officials will study suggestions that fees should be based on home sizes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also addressed worries from lawmakers that some landlords might not comply with the regulations and operate subpar homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The design of the [basic housing unit] regime comes with a very sufficient grace period and registration period," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our requirements are very pragmatic... These are all doable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may need a reporting mechanism to catch the most serious cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping to introduce a bill on regulating the compact homes in the latter half of this year.

    HK 'remains art hub despite global market decline'

<img alt="Lindsay Dewar says declining sales at events such as Art Basel Hong Kong reflect a global trend. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798264_1_20250331161511.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong just wrapped up another year of art festivals, including Art Basel and Art Central this month, and they have led an investor to say the city remains an important hub for the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1014051&livetime=20250331000000" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , ArtTactic chief operating officer Lindsay Dewar said last year was a tough one for the market since its peak back in 2022 and despite its recovery from the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year saw a decline of 27 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she said there is "a new normality" in the market and "people are finding their footing again."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a notable decline in modern and contemporary art sales in the SAR and the mainland, Dewar says Hong Kong remains the third largest art centre worldwide for auction sales and that market sales globally has doubled over the past 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really remarkable to see a market grow so much in such a relatively short period and that really speaks to the confidence the art community sees in Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that Hong Kong still accounts for up to 81 percent of total art sales in both the SAR and the mainland, showing its importance in this portion of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on a decline in auction turnover at Art Basel Hong Kong recently, Dewar thinks it reflects more of the general world market trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is kind of a broader trend that we're seeing, and it's worth bearing in mind that the sale we had in London at the beginning of this month was also down," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that a new generation of art collectors is emerging that is seeking more affordable artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latest tariff uncertainties and reduced returns over assets recently have impacted the global art market, and Dewar believes there are two main impacts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said shorter holding periods are one of them, with people being less speculative and wanting to hold on to their artworks longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another is that market may become more regional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a while after Covid people are looking at the market and thinking where's the best part of the market for me to sell in... whereas now we might see people saying I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to stay in Hong Kong... so like the American market may become more American," Dewar said.

    US tariffs to target 'all countries'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the tariffs he plans to impose in the coming days would include "all countries," not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised a "Liberation Day" on Wednesday, when he is set to unveil reciprocal levies to address trade practices that his government deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," he said onboard Air Force One, dashing hopes he might scale back some of the threatened levies or that they would target a select group with persistent trade imbalances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15," he said when asked which nations would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been talking about all countries, not a cutoff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's upcoming tariff salvo had been expected to target the 15 percent of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a "Dirty 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite widening the target, the president insisted his tariffs would be more "generous" than those levied against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and additional levies on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's top trade aide Peter Navarro said the tax on auto imports could raise US$100 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about US$600 billion a year, about US$6 trillion over a 10-year period," Navarro said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plans to unleash a wide range of reciprocal tariffs risk a global trade war, with other countries already vowing to retaliate and economists warning the sweeping moves risk stoking inflation and triggering a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has defended the levies as a way to raise government revenue and revitalize US industry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country’s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning through more than 48,000 hectares.
 <br>
  <br>
  The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire to clear overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday and plan to question the man soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the seventh century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were two state-designated “treasures,” a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668 and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. (AP)

 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Data breach of 128,000 'due to system fix and neglect'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data says a data breach incident by ImagineX has led to nearly 128,000 people’s information being compromised.
 <br>
  <br>
  Failing to delete temporary accounts in a timely manner and the use of end-of-support operating systems were the main factors leading to the breach, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog said in May it received a report from ImagineX Management, a brand management company, about a ransom note related to stolen personal data.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an investigation, the office found that the hacker had exploited a temporary user account and then used it to access the company’s intranet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 68GB of personal data – involving names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth months, genders and nationalities – of the nearly 128,000 people were compromised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said those affected were mostly from brands who participated in ImagineX Management ‘s two membership programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, there’s no evidence indicating the stolen data is being circulated or misused, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief personal data officer Brad Kwok said the company had set up a temporary account with remote access to fix a system problem but forgot to delete it afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This allowed the threat actor to exploit the account to compromise the network 10 days after the account was set up,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the investigation, we also found that ImagineX lacked standard procedures for creating and managing temporary accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made the deletion of the temporary account solely dependent on measures taken by individual staff members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the company had also used an operating system that had no longer been updated since 2020, making it vulnerable to attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also accused of having inefficient detection measures and not conducting sufficient security risk reviews and audits for its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said it issued an enforcement notice to ImagineX as it contravened the data protection principle and urged the company to take measures to prevent similar contraventions.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI guidelines for employees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Monday issued a checklist to guide organisations in regulating their employees’ use of generative artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the checklist is important as the secure use of AI is an essential part of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the areas of technological development and industrial innovation, the country has all along stressed the equal importance of development and safety,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to implement the spirit of the Two Sessions… and in order to facilitate the safe and healthy development and use of AI in Hong Kong, my office published the checklist on guidelines for the use of generative AI by employees today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations must specify tasks in which employees are allowed to use AI, with examples including drafting documents, summarising information and creating video and audio content.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also clearly define which AI tools employees can use, which may include publicly-available or internally developed systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The devices that can access the AI tools should also be regulated, the PCPD noted, as organisations are advised to establish clear distinctions between work devices and personal devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations should also spell out the penalties or review mechanisms for employees who don’t adhere to the guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said organisations need to be particularly careful if they want to train their AI models with data from clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, when you first collect the data, you did not tell them that it would be used for training AI but subsequently you want to [do so],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And you will need to obtain the customer's expressed and voluntary consent to do that under the Privacy Ordinance.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The full checklist of the newly released guidelines is available for download on the  PCPD’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said a hotline has been set up for organisations to make enquiries about how to use AI safely and properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung also pointed out that the privacy watchdog has initiated compliance checks on 60 private-sector organisations and government departments to assess how responsibly they are using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results will be finalised by summer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and the University of Cambridge signed a global research collaboration deal on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the deal, 18 top post-doctoral researchers from around the world will be based in Cambridge, taking advantage of its laboratories and resources under supervision by principal investigators from both universities for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU council chairman Michael Ngai said the collaboration aligns with the strategic goals of the Hong Kong government.
  <br>
  <br>
  'It serves as a vital step in further establishing Hong Kong as a premier international hub of higher education," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six colleges and departments from each university will be collaborating together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key research areas range from 3D medical data to creativity in an age of intelligent machines.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU said the institution plans to offer attractive presidential assistant professorship positions to postdoctoral fellows upon the completion of their research contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This collaboration now represents a single largest postdoctoral fellowship programme between University of Cambridge in Asia and an Asian university," CityU president Freddy Boey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the signing ceremony, University of Cambridge vice-chancellor Deborah Prentice said "this partnership will enable these outstanding scholars to have the freedom to continue to push the frontiers of research in addressing global challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that CityU has recently been recognised as the world's most international university by Times Higher Education in both 2024 and 2025.

<img alt="The government is hoping that a cross-border railway link between Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai will become operational in 2035. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798240_1_20250331131812.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking into the possibility of having a single contractor design, build and operate a planned cross-border railway in the northwestern New Territories and says officials will start gauging developers' interest later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link, which is a key component of the Northern Metropolis, is aimed at connecting Hung Shui Kiu with Qianhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Estimated to come into operation in 2035, the proposed 18-kilometre cross-border railway is expected to take residents from one place to the other in 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the administration is considering different options for the project, including a "design, build and operate" contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the second half of the year when we invite intentions and expressions, we will then know whether [it can be] a design, build and operate [model] or whether it is [having] design and build as a contract and then operation as another contract," Chan told lawmakers on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experienced operators can take up the operation solely, or they can partner up with other operating companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three stations along the proposed link will be in Hong Kong and two will be across the border. A co-location arrangement is expected to be adopted for immigration and customs facilities on the Shenzhen side.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some lawmakers called for both of the stations in Shenzhen to have checkpoints, the transport chief said officials are still hammering out details of the arrangement with mainland counterparts.

    Trump 'not joking' about bid for third term

<img alt="Donald Trump chats with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, left, on board Marine One upon arrival at the White House on Sunday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798236_1_20250331125457.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said “I’m not joking” about trying to serve a third term, the clearest indication he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends at the beginning of 2029.
 <br>
  <br>
  “There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview on Sunday with NBC News from Mar-a-Lago, his private club.
  <br>
  <br>
  He elaborated later to reporters on Air Force One from Florida to Washington that "I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged.” Trump lost that election to Democrat Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump added: “I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22nd amendment, added to the Constitution in 1951 after President Franklin D Roosevelt was elected four times in a row, says “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy," said a statement from Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment. "If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Bannon, a former Trump strategist who runs the right-wing “War Room” podcast, called for the president to run again during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards," said Thompson, who was attending a campaign event on Sunday with Elon Musk in Green Bay for a state Supreme Court race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston’s Northeastern University, said "there are no credible legal arguments for him to run for a third term.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, that’s one,” Trump responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Can you tell me another?” Welker asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Trump replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Muller, a professor of election law at Notre Dame, noted that the 12th amendment, which was ratified in 1804, says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for vice president, either.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in “the toughest job in the country” at that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, I like working,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suggested that Americans would go along with a third term because of his popularity. He falsely claimed to have “the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Gallup data shows President George W Bush reaching a 90 percent approval rating after the attacks on September 11, 2001. His father, President George H.W. Bush, hit 89 percent following the Gulf War in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has maxed out at 47 percent in Gallup data during his second term, despite claiming to be "in the high 70s in many polls, in the real polls.” (AP)

    Duterte lawyer insists ICC 'has no jurisdiction'

<img alt="Friends and relatives of some of the thousands killed during former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's 'war on drugs' call for justice and his conviction by the International Criminal Court in Manila on Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798229_1_20250331121432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's lead lawyer said there was a "compelling" argument to throw out the International Criminal Court case against the former Philippines president before it even comes to trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Kaufman said in an interview in The Hague he hoped to stop the case before the ICC confirms the charges against Duterte by arguing the court cannot exercise its jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Philippines' withdrawal from the court had become effective well before an investigation was authorised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte, 80, faces a charge of crimes against humanity for murder over his "war on drugs" that claimed the lives of thousands of mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Israeli lawyer Kaufman, 56, said: "Coming back to the jurisdictional point, obviously you don't need to be the dean of a law faculty to realise that that's going to be a huge issue at pre-trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the jurisdictional argument is compelling as defence counsel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that it should succeed and I would be hugely disappointed if it doesn't succeed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to persuade the judges pre-trial that it [the court] cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There won't be a confirmation-of-charges hearing if the judges rule in our favour."
  <br>
  <br>
  A confirmation of charges hearing, where prosecutor and defence first lay out their evidence, is currently scheduled for September 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue of jurisdiction is key in this case as the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, when the court issued its arrest warrant for Duterte, it noted that the alleged crimes took place while the country was still an ICC member.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the alleged conduct has taken place between 1 November 2011 and 16 March 2019 on the territory of the Philippines, it falls within the court's jurisdiction," the ICC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC chief prosecutor's application for his arrest said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population" in the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The families of victims of his war on drugs see the ICC case as a long-awaited chance for justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another likely critical issue for the defence will be Duterte's arrest on March 11 and his rapid handover to the ICC in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I view it as a kidnapping, nothing more or less. It's an extrajudicial rendition. He was given no due process, just slung over to the Hague," Kaufman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was in complete contravention of Philippines law."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president's sudden detention came amid a spectacular deterioration in relations between the two most powerful families in Philippines politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Duterte and Marcos clans teamed up to win an election landslide in 2022 that saw Ferdinand Marcos become president and Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned Rodrigo, vice-president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Duterte "should have been brought before a judge before he was thrown onto a plane and dumped in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That didn't happen. As I've said already, this is a political hit job," said Kaufman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The politics in that country basically ended up in a situation where they needed to get him out of the picture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incumbent government did not want him in the picture anymore."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was visiting his client virtually every day in the ICC detention centre, a couple of kilometres from the beach in the suburb of Scheveningen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was "adjusting to the reality of prison life. That's not easy for anyone," according to his lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the former president was in "good spirits," said Kaufman, whose previous clients at ICC include former Congolese rebel leader Jean-Pierre Bemba and Aisha Kadhafi, daughter of the deceased Libyan dictator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaufman said he was concerned that the ICC, currently under fire from all sides and even US sanctions, would be reluctant to give up such a high-profile case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My only fear is that this court is starved of cases at the present moment and might be loath to let a case like that go, to slip through its hands." (AFP)

    Kai Tak operators 'inexperienced in serving big crowd'

<img alt="Allan Zeman believes operators will learn a lesson from the Sevens, after some fans complained about not being able to get food at the venue. File Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798224_1_20250331112814.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kai Tak Sports Park will "learn a good lesson" from hosting the Hong Kong Sevens and be better prepared in the future following complaints by fans over their inability to get food at the venue, a business tycoon said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some rugby fans had complained over the dearth of food at Kai Tak Stadium, where the three-day tournament was held, after the government had told operators to enhance their food supply services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're inexperienced at handling a crowd that big and I think they will learn a good lesson," said Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman on RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was the first time they were slammed over three days with that many people, and not expecting how much food they could sell, how much drinks they could sell... They probably would stock up in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament has welcomed more than 110,000 visitors in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure fell short of Hong Kong China Rugby's 139,000 expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also the vice chairman of the Major Sports Events Committee, told another RTHK radio show that this might be due to the event being held in the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that's because the Kai Tak venue is much bigger than Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My understanding is that 90 percent of the tickets were taken up but there's still room for more ticket sales," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the event will now have made its reputation and I hope there will be more visitors in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who was among those attending the Sevens, said the atmosphere was very good and that overall operations had been very smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon City district councillor Cheung King-fan said there were some complaints by Kai Tak residents about noise coming from the fans' village located on the east side of the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reflected the issue to the organiser, park operator and the Environmental Protection Department," he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic faced a series of obstacles in the Miami Open final: a delay of more than five-and-a-half hours before the match, an eye infection and a slippery court due to high levels of humidity following the rain.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the largest roadblock was the youth and power of 6-foot-4, 19-year-old phenom Jakub Mensik, who outdueled the 37-year-old Serbian in two tiebreakers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) to win his first ATP title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 54th entering the tournament, the Czech Republic teenager plowed through Djokovic with poise and a stellar 130 mph serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He collected 14 aces and got broken only once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik bashed a service winner on match point and fell on his back.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You’re the one I idolized when I was young,″ Mensik said to Djokovic during the ceremony after the match that lasted two hours and three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I started playing tennis because of you.″
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik’s victory spoiled the party for Djokovic, who was seeking his 100th career title and a record seventh in the Miami Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will have to wait, while the teenager looks ready to join the elite.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a joyous moment for him and his family – an unbelievable tournament, first of many,″ Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It hurts me to admit it, you were better. In the clutch moments you delivered the goods. For a young player like yourself, this is a great feature.″
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd pulled hard for Djokovic, who hadn’t played here since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of the fans stuck around despite the massive delay, chanting “No-vak!’’ and singing his name across critical parts of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, far from a fan favorite here earlier in his career, saluted the fans, saying it was one of the warmest crowds he’s had ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the men’s leader with 24 Grand Slam titles seemed compromised by his eye issue, with redness seen under the eyelid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic applied eyedrops during two changeovers in the first set. It was unclear if it affected his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the set, he also slipped twice on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The humidity reached 90 percent after hours of rain disrupted the card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweating profusely, Djokovic asked the umpire for a bucket of sawdust to sprinkle on his wet grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik had lost to Djokovic in a three-setter in October at the Shanghai Masters but the youngster said before the match he had played too nervously.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik was playing his first ATP 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was not quite two years old when Djokovic won his first Miami Open title in 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was more fearlessness this time than in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik got up 3-0 with an early break but Djokovic broke back at 4-3, then held for 4-4 after fans chanted his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik held for a 6-5 lead in a game that saw Djokovic take a tumble in the doubles alley chasing a drop shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik served it out with his seventh ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first-set tiebreak, Mensik charged ahead 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik executed a leaping backhand volley winner and Djokovic muffed a routine forehand drop shot into the net to fall behind 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  On set point, Mensik slugged an overhead smash for a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was scheduled for 3am Hong Kong time but the players didn’t take the court until almost six hours later due to rain and organisers deciding on completing the women’s doubles final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Florida rain began during the women’s doubles final pitting Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider against Cristina Bucsa and Miyu Kato, with Andreeva and Shnaider leading 3-0 in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s players returned to the court later after the rain stopped and the courts were readied by court-drying machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain began minutes later before warmups and the umbrella-toting players left the court again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women returned to the court an hour later and resumed play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva and Schnaider went the distance, prevailing in a third-set match tiebreaker 6-3, 6-7 (5), 10-2. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An SAR government rescue team is on its way to quake-hit Mandalay in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 51-strong team, including firefighters, doctors and nurses, had earlier arrived in the country's capital, Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, they rested briefly at the Myanmar National Centre for Disease Control and met diplomats from the Chinese embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While they originally planned to work in Naypyidaw, Myanmar officials asked them to go to Mandalay instead – which is near the epicentre of the 7.7-magnitude quake on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rescue squad departed overnight but had to pause their journey due to a night curfew on the roads, according to a Facebook post by the Security Bureau on Monday.

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798214_1_20250331103953.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven players and members of coaching staff were ejected after a wild brawl broke out during the Minnesota Timberwolves' 123-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons in the NBA.
 <br>
  <br>
  A testy duel between the two sides at the Target Center in Minneapolis erupted into chaos early in the second quarter when Minnesota's Naz Reid took exception to being bumped by Detroit's Ron Holland as he drove towards the basket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reid jabbed a finger angrily at Holland as the two players squared up after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It escalated rapidly, with players from both sides being sucked into the melee that spilled into the spectator seats at courtside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves' Donte DiVincenzo was in the thick of the uproar and tumbled backwards into the seating as a scrum of players and team officials grappled around him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protracted scrap lasted around a minute before tempers cooled and the officiating crew began to determine who was at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it was over, the Timberwolves' Reid and DiVincenzo – who could be seen with what looked like large scratch marks near his neck – were tossed along with the Pistons' Marcus Sasser, Isaiah Stewart and Holland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Pistons head coach J B Bickerstaff was also ejected while Minnesota's assistant coach Pablo Prigioni was also tossed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minnesota head coach Chris Finch later suggested Detroit's overly physical approach early in the game had triggered the flashpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for his view of the incident, Finch replied: "Two guys went at it, and then spilled over into the crowd which was super dangerous.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then obviously it just kept escalating, and escalating, mostly from their side to be honest with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought leading up to that the game was way too physical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a little lopsided in its physicality and I thought it was bound to happen. It just felt like it was coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew they were a super physical team. They hit you, they hold you...but I just thought it got to a point where players were going to take matters into their own hands, and you don't ever want that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit coach Bickerstaff, meanwhile, accused Prigioni of triggering the incident that saw them both ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was things said by their assistant coach," Bickerstaff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I'm in the same boat as my guys are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to defend each other and I'm not going to let people say belligerent things about my guys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And it's that simple. So he said what he said. He knows what he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, I didn't think it crossed the line to escalation of anything, but in that moment, I understand, you know, the refs' position."
  <br>
  <br>
  US media reported meanwhile that a young fan sitting at courtside who had been caught in the chaotic scrum was later presented with a Minnesota team jersey by Alex Rodriguez, the former Major League Baseball star who is now a part owner of the Timberwolves. (AFP)

<img alt="Official data shows the purchasing managers' index for manufacturing was up 0.3 percentage points from February. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798209_1_20250331101633.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year in March, an official factory survey showed on Monday, in a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy as it deals with an escalating US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 50.5 in March versus 50.2 in February, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was the highest PMI reading since March 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, accelerated to 50.8 from 50.4.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at "around five percent", despite new tariffs from US President Donald Trump, which threaten to hit the massive export sector, a key driver for the US$18 trillion economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed a cumulative 20 percent tariff on all Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president is also preparing to announce "reciprocal" tariffs on Wednesday, a move designed to address trade imbalances, which could hit Chinese goods with additional levies. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The board of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said on Monday it has not made any decision on its global telecommunications business, in response to media reports about a potential spin-off listing of the assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From time to time, the Group receives proposals and explores and evaluates opportunities that may be available, with a view to enhancing long term value to shareholders, including possible transactions relating to the assets and operations of the company's global telecommunication businesses," the board said in a stock exchange filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spin-off listing would be among those options, according to the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said no decision has been made about any transaction and there is no certainty a transaction will take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, the company is mulling a spin-off of global telecom assets and would list the business on the London stock exchange. (Reuters)

    China discovers major oilfield in South China Sea

<img alt="CNOOC says the new oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798194_1_20250331091600.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has discovered an oilfield in the South China Sea with proven reserves exceeding 100 million tonnes, Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly-found Huizhou 19-6 oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen and sits at an average water depth of 100 metres, the report said, adding that test drilling has yielded a daily production of 413 barrels of crude oil and 68,000 cubic metres of natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huizhou 19-6 is China's first large-scale integrated clastic oilfield in the deep to ultra-deep layers, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to CNOOC, offshore oil and gas exploration in deep to ultra-deep layers face multiple challenges, including high temperatures, high pressures, and complex conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, clastic reservoirs, an important component of deep-sea hydrocarbon deposits, generally have low permeability, making the identification of large oil and gas fields more difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng Guangrong, a geologist at CNOOC's Shenzhen branch, noted that 60 percent of the world's newly-discovered oil and gas reserves have come from deep layers. With abundant resources and a low level of exploration, deep to ultra-deep layers are expected to drive future growth in oil and gas reserves and production.
  <br>
  <br>
  CNOOC's CEO says China's oil and gas exploration in the eastern South China Sea has seen consecutive breakthroughs, with oilfields exceeding 100 million tonnes in reserves discovered for two straight years. (Xinhua)

    Venezuela says high-level criminal among US deportees

<img alt="Repatriation flight with migrants deported from the US lands in at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798190_1_20250331090008.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelan authorities reported the arrival on Sunday of a new flight of 175 migrants expelled by the United States, including a gang leader - the first time Caracas has confirmed a criminal was among the deportees.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has launched a crackdown on migrants since coming to power in January, deporting hundreds of people to Latin America that his administration has branded as "gangsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the first time in these flights... someone of weight arrives who has been claimed by the Venezuelan justice system," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the man was "not from Tren de Aragua," referring to the Venezuelan gang that Washington branded a "foreign terrorist organisation" and claims many of the deported Venezuelan migrants belong to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello received the migrants at the Maiquetia International Airport that serves Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He belongs to a gang from Trujillo state, the gang... El Cagon," Cabello added, without offering further details on the criminal's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabello said that of the migrants received by Venezuela so far, none were members of Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in 2019, but had a rapprochement in January to agree on deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  That cooperation was interrupted for a month after Washington cracked down on Venezuela's oil sector, but flights resumed a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's flight was the third to land since the resumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, 918 people have arrived in Venezuela after being deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 553 migrants have returned from Mexico, although it was unclear whether they were originally deported from US soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the United Nations, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their country, fleeing an economic crisis that began to show signs of recovery in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government claims that more than 1.2 million have returned. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Keir Starmer and Donald Trump spoke on Sunday and had "productive" talks towards a UK-US trade deal, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street office said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since Britain's exit from the European Union at the start of the decade, successive UK governments have sought to strike a trade deal with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They discussed the productive negotiations between their respective teams on a UK-US economic prosperity deal, agreeing that these will continue at pace this week," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They agreed to stay in touch in the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump himself has dangled the prospect of a "great" deal that could help the United Kingdom avoid, or at least soften, the blow caused by the tariffs the US president has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the EU, Britain has declined to retaliate against the tariffs already imposed on the country's steel industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the previous Conservative government did not manage to ink a deal in, Labour party leader Starmer came away from a Washington visit in late February hopeful of reaching an agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK is believed to want a trade deal ahead of Trump's so-called April 2 "Liberation Day", when he is set to unveil a range of tariffs for different trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any such accord is yet to see the light of day. (AFP)

    Myanmar quake a top-level emergency, says WHO

<img alt="Rescuers work at the site of a damaged building in Mandalay. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798187_1_20250331084335.jpg&q=45">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday that the Myanmar earthquake was a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said the high numbers of casualties and trauma injuries were at high risk of infection due to limited surgical capacity in the country, while the underlying conditions in Myanmar meant the quake was likely to intensify the risk of disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WHO has classified this crisis as a Grade 3 emergency - the highest level of activation under its Emergency Response Framework," the United Nations health agency said in its flash appeal for funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the central Myanmar city of Mandalay on Friday, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake has killed more than 1,700 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar, "preliminary assessments indicate high numbers of casualties and trauma-related injuries, with urgent needs for emergency care. Electricity and water supplies remain disrupted, worsening access to health services and heightening risks of waterborne and food-borne disease outbreaks," the WHO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trauma-related injuries - including fractures, open wounds, and crush syndrome - are at high risk of infection and complications due to limited surgical capacity and inadequate infection prevention and control."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said hospitals were overwhelmed, while the scale of deaths, injuries and damage to health facilities "are not yet fully understood".
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said displacement into overcrowded shelters, combined with the destruction of water systems and sanitation infrastructure, had sharply increased the risk of communicable disease outbreaks. (AFP)

    Actor Richard Chamberlain dies aged 90

File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798193_1_20250331091507.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Richard Chamberlain, the Emmy-nominated actor and 1960s heartthrob who rocketed to fame in the TV medical drama "Dr Kildare" and starred in the mini-series "Shogun" and "The Thorn Birds" has died at the age of 90, publicist Harlan Boll said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain died late on Saturday in Hawaii from complications from a stroke, he said in a statement on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was an instant hit, and became a teen idol, as the handsome Dr James Kildare in the series that ran from 1961-1966. The Guardian newspaper said the then 27-year-old actor "looked like he had been sculpted by a loving god out of butter, honey and grace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakout role was the start of a six decade-career that spanned theatre, films and television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain was dubbed the "king of the mini-series" after appearing in several TV dramas in the 1980s and earned plaudits on stage in roles ranging from Professor Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" and Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" to Shakespeare's Hamlet and Richard II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also was the original Jason Bourne in the 1988 mini-series "The Bourne Identity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's fascinating about Richard is that his range is enormous. His ability to be different each time out is what makes him such a valuable property," producer Susan Baerwald told the New York Times in 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  The versatile actor was nominated for four Emmys -- as an English navigator in 17th century Japan in "Shogun" (1981), a love-torn priest in "The Thorn Birds" (1983), Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in "Wallenberg: A Hero's Story" (1985) and for the title role in the 1975 TV movie "The Count of Monte-Cristo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of his roles were as romantic leading men, which is why he did not publicly reveal he was a homosexual until he was 68 years old. He feared it would ruin his career. For much of his life he said he pretended to be someone else. "When you grow up in the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s being gay, it's not only ain't easy, it's just impossible,” he told the New York Times in 2014. "I assumed there was something terribly wrong with me. And even becoming famous and all that, it was still there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain said it was a tremendous relief after he acknowledged his sexuality in his 2003 autobiography "Shattered Love: A Memoir."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no fear left," he said in a 2019 interview. "It was a wonderful experience. People were open, friendly and sweet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934, in Los Angeles, he was the youngest of two sons. He had hoped to be an artist but switched to acting after attending Pomona College in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  His acting career was put on hold when he was drafted into the US Army in 1956 and served in Korea. After his discharge, Chamberlain returned to Los Angeles, where he co-founded a theatre group and had small parts on TV before becoming Dr Kildare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The success of the TV show led to a brief singing career and film roles opposite Julie Christie in "Petulia" (1968) and "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1969) with Katherine Hepburn. He had a brief run in the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's" with Mary Tyler Moore. The show closed after four previews.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the late 1960s, Chamberlain moved to England where he honed his acting skills in the BBC series "The Portrait of a Lady" and as Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dr Kildare was a huge hit in England, and I heard that all the London reviewers were coming to rip this interloper to pieces," he said in an interview. "But we got very good reviews."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain returned to the big screen as Lord Byron in the drama "Lady Caroline Lamb" (1972), "The Three Musketeers" (1973) and as a villain in the disaster film "The Towering Inferno" (1974).
  <br>
  <br>
  Throughout his career he mixed roles in Broadway plays, including Tennessee Williams' "The Night of the Iguana," with musicals, TV and films.
  <br>
  <br>
  After coming out publicly, he played both gay and straight characters in TV shows including "Brothers & Sisters," "Will & Grace" and "Desperate Housewives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The actor released a book of haiku poetry in 2012 and narrated Audubon environmental television specials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chamberlain lived in Hawaii for many years and had a three-decade relationship with actor and writer Martin Rabbett, his co-star in the 1986 adventure film "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold." The couple parted in 2010 but remained close friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul," Rabbett said in a statement. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford's first goals for Aston Villa inspired a 3-0 win against Preston that sent his side into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 10 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rashford struck twice in the second half at Deepdale to end Preston's stubborn resistance before Jacob Ramsey wrapped up Villa's long-awaited return to the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa will face Crystal Palace, 3-0 winners at Fulham on Saturday, in the semi-finals at Wembley on the weekend of April 26 to 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revitalised since joining Villa on loan from Manchester United during the January transfer window, Rashford is beginning to show the form that made him one of England's brightest stars prior to his steep decline over the last two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid concerns over his attitude and off-field behaviour, Rashford was deemed expendable by United manager Ruben Amorim, after also clashing with former Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old hadn't scored since netting for United against Everton on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deployed in the central striker's role that often seemed to dent his confidence at United, Rashford was too dynamic for second-tier Preston to handle in the latest sign that his career might not be destined to end in disappointment after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's always nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues," Rashford said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I missed a lot of football before joining up with Villa. It's step by step. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now," he added. "We're very ambitious. We'll see where it takes us."
  <br>
  <br>
  While struggling United have been mired in turmoil, Rashford has benefited from moving to upwardly mobile Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester City came from behind to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for a record seventh consecutive season with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth, but victory came at a cost as Erling Haaland hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had seen a first-half penalty saved before Evanilson put the Cherries in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made amends by equalising four minutes into the second period before being forced off with an ankle injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, Omar Marmoush, took just two minutes to score the winner from a second assist by the impressive Nico O'Reilly as City booked a semi-final clash against Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven times in a row reaching semi-finals in the FA Cup – this is outstanding. This generation of players, they have done this," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have been a shadow of the side that won four consecutive Premier League titles this season and Guardiola said prior to the game that even FA Cup glory would not save a miserable season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' collapse in the Premier League began at Bournemouth back in November with a 2-1 defeat that kicked off a run of six defeats in eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola hailed the difference in attitude in his side between then and now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came here in November with the flip flops on against a team that if you don't compete, it is impossible," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In football you have to run," he added. "People say about my teams 'how good they play' but no, it is how much we run, how much we fight and for many games this season it didn't happen." (AFP)

    Trump threatens Iran with bombings and tariffs

<img alt="In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798156_2_20250331075407.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said US and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing," Trump said. "But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's language represented a sharpening of his comment a few days earlier that if Tehran refused to negotiate a new nuclear agreement, "bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran says its nuclear programme is wholly for civilian energy purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, in his second term, he has said he is open to talks on a new deal that could reduce the risk of military escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump revealed in early March that he had sent a letter proposing such talks to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran, deeply suspicious of the US administration after Trump's withdrawal from the original nuclear deal, has refused to negotiate directly with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency that he had delivered a letter responding to Trump's outreach to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past. (Agencies)

    Mitchell magic as Cavs down Clippers to bag 60th win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell led from the front as the Cleveland Cavaliers bagged their 60th win of the NBA season with a 127-122 victory over the in-form Los Angeles Clippers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland talisman Mitchell finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in what Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson later described as his best performance of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's victory means Cleveland have reached 60 wins in a season for the first time since the 2009-2010 campaign, and for only the third time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  More significantly, the win leaves Cleveland four-and-a-half games clear of NBA champions Boston in the race for the number one seeding in the Eastern Conference playoffs with just seven regular season fixtures remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Atkinson said reaching 60 wins was beyond his expectations at the start of the campaign following a 48-victory season in 2023-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect 60 wins," Atkinson said. "My internal goal was 'Can we improve from last year?' That was kind of where my mind was. But for this team to take it to another level and kind of shatter that says a lot. And we're not done – we can still add to that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we've got to celebrate this," he continued. "It's not the end goal, but we should take a deep breath and celebrate 60 wins. It's so hard to do in this league. I'm really happy for the guys today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell received offensive support from Jarrett Allen with 25 points, while Evan Mobley added 22 and Darius Garland 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Atkinson reserved special praise for Mitchell, who was immense at both ends of the court for Cleveland, with four steals in addition to his points tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's at that kind of maturity and mental level where he can manipulate the game how he wants it," Atkinson said of the 28-year-old six-time NBA All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would argue that this was probably his best all around game all year," he added. "He did everything tonight and showed great leadership."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat left the Clippers in eighth position in the Western Conference, where they are locked in a ferocious dog-fight with Golden State and Minnesota for an automatic ticket into the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers are on 42-32 – the same record as the seventh-placed Timberwolves – with the Warriors sixth on 42-31 heading into the final two weeks of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the Western Conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four of the mainland's largest state-owned banks said on Sunday they plan to raise a combined 520 billion yuan (US$71.60 billion) in private placements from investors, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), after Beijing pledged to help them support the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fundraising, which aims to boost the banks' core tier-1 capital, comes after policymakers vowed earlier this month to recapitalise major state banks to the tune of 500 billion yuan to boost their ability to bolster the real economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of China said it aims to raise up to 165 billion yuan and China Construction Bank plans private placements of up to 105 billion yuan, filings released by the banks on Sunday said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Communications said it will sell shares of as much as 120 billion yuan, and Postal Savings Bank of China will raise up to 130 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry, a major shareholder of the four banks, will be involved in all four capital raises, the filings showed. The ministry is set to become the controlling shareholder for Bank of Communications following the share issue, the bank said in its filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four banks said that capital replenishment from the MOF is a crucial move from the government to support their stable operations and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry analysts said that the capital replenishment is a proactive measure that will strengthen the banks' capital foundations and optimise their capital structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This move will enhance their operational resilience and risk management capabilities, enabling them to better serve the real economy and stabilise the financial system, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has set its economic growth target for this year at roughly 5 percent, unchanged from last year, as the government pledged more fiscal resources to fend off deflationary pressures and offset the impact from US tariffs. (Xinhua, Reuters)

    Bagnaia wins USA MotoGP after Márquez crash

<img alt="Francesco Bagnaia of Italy rides during the 2025 Grand Prix of the Americas at Circuit of The Americas. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798175_1_20250331060812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Francesco Bagnaia won an eventful Grand Prix of the Americas to end crash-victim Marc Márquez's perfect start to the MotoGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Six-time elite class champion Márquez was set fair to make it six wins out of six in Texas after romping to victories in the sprints and main races in Thailand, Argentina and Saturday's sprint in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a crash on lap nine did it for the Spanish superstar, gifting victory to his Ducati factory teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Márquez, on a Ducati satellite bike, took second for the sixth time to move one point clear of his older brother in the riders' standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fabio Di Giannantonio, on another Ducati satellite machine, came in third at the Circuit of the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia supplied Ducati with their 20th consecutive grand prix success, just two shy of Honda's historic benchmark of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was chaos before lights out with riders on the grid, their bikes equipped with wet tyres, all set for the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, with the changeable overcast conditions drying, pole-sitter Marc Márquez dramatically ran back to the pits to swop to a bike with slicks, triggering a domino effect as his grid rivals copied his example.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he had not sat on his bike Márquez did not break any rules, only causing mayhem, and a delayed start with a race reduced by one lap to 19 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one last twist to the pre-race drama, when Maverick Vinales, last year's winner, had to wheel his bike off the grid with an issue to start from the pits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez got away to a flyer when they were eventually let go to lead from Alex Márquez with Bagnaia up from sixth to third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez senior quickly stamped his authority on the race with more than a one second cushion over the chasing pack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia moved up to second after eight laps, albeit over two seconds behind the rider who lists the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) as one of his favourite tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the race was turned on its head when Márquez crashed on lap nine, slithering off his bike after touching a kerb.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejoined in 18th place with 10 laps remaining, only to call it a day a couple of laps later.
  <br>
  <br>
  One frustrated bystander at COTA was world champion Jorge Martin who has missed the opening three rounds after breaking his right hand and foot in pre-season testing crash in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has delayed his title defence and his debut for Aprilia. He moved to the team after being overlooked by Ducati for the factory ride that was offered to Márquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard faces a seemingly Herculean task though to defend his title when he resumes in Qatar next time out, lagging 87 points behind Alex Márquez on his belated seasonal bow, with Marc Márquez on 86, and Bagnaia third on 75 points. (AFP)

<img alt="Lewandowski scored twice as Barca remain unbeaten this year in 20 matches. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798174_1_20250331055012.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert Lewandowski bagged a brace as Barcelona eased to a 4-1 victory over Girona to move three points clear at the top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  After second-placed Real Madrid pulled level on points with them on Saturday by beating Leganes, Hansi Flick's side restored their advantage at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewandowski responded to Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe's double with one of his own to stay three goals ahead in the race for Spain's golden boot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, unbeaten this year in 20 matches, took the lead through a Ladislav Krejci own goal near the end of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arnaut Danjuma pulled Girona level but Lewandowski netted twice and Ferran Torres finished off the rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game," veteran striker Lewandowski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old said he had the legs to keep playing for seasons to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know a lot of people are talking abut my age but I want to play more years at the top level," said the Poland international. "I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona beat Barcelona twice last season but have struggled to hit those heights again and sit 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were superior," admitted Girona coach Michel Sanchez. "There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth. Barcelona dream of titles every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick rotated some of his usual suspects with the Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were below their free-flowing best in the first half despite dominating, occasionally threatening through the dynamic running of teenage star Lamine Yamal and frantic energy of Fermin Lopez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona wanted a penalty when Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla on the edge of the box and a free-kick was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review showed the contact was inside the area but the referee decided Lopez fouled Asprilla as they came together, much to Barcelona's chagrin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Gazzaniga produced a sensational save with his fingertips to push out a Ronald Araujo header but Barca found a way through before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal's dangerous free-kick aimed at Eric Garcia was deflected into his own net by Krejci at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona had produced very little of note in the first half but were back level eight minutes into the second through Danjuma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daley Blind played the Dutch striker through and he beat Wojciech Szczesny with a clinical low finish. However, Barcelona were swiftly back in front as La Liga's top goalscorer Lewandowski notched his 24th of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopez nodded the ball across the six-yard box and Lewandowski contorted his body to reach it and flick it between Gazzaniga's legs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward secured Barcelona's victory with his 25th, slotting home after substitute Frenkie de Jong pushed forward into space and fed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was time for Torres to add a fourth after Gerard Martin found him and for the brilliant Yamal to bend a strike against the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was remarkably the 20th time this season Flick's side have scored four goals or more from 45 games, with a potential treble in their sights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that," Flick told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, fourth-place Athletic Bilbao were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Osasuna, allowing Villarreal to cut the gap on them to six points after beating Getafe 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Betis, sixth, won their sixth game in a row to stay on Villarreal's tail, beating rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valencia's 1-0 win over Mallorca took them 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<img alt="This building in Mandalay is among those that collapsed in Friday's killer earthquake. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798150_1_20250330223525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the country where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, struck on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States pledged US$2 million in aid "through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organisations" and said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, is deploying to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical infrastructure – including bridges, highways, airports and railways – across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas near the epicentre, residents said government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible," Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. "It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could eventually top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including the second-biggest city, Mandalay, and the capital Naypyitaw, were struggling to cope with an influx of injured people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake also shook parts of neighbouring Thailand, bringing down an under-construction skyscraper and killing 18 people across the capital, according to Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 76 people remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed Bangkok building, where rescue operations continued for a third day, using drones and sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors. (Reuters)
