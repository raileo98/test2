<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was briefed by Financial Secretary Paul Chan on his plan to boost the economy during his inspection trip to the tech zones in Hetao and Qianhai on Sunday, according to a government statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement said Xia told the SAR to "continue to be bold in reform, dare to break new ground, and to innovate continuously".
  <br>
  <br>
  The top mainland official was accompanied by Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan and the financial secretary in his visit to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia listened to officials’ presentations on the latest development progress and the focus of work for the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later visited the Qianhai cooperation zone and hosted a four-hour discussion session, in which Paul Chan told Xia on what he will do to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia and SAR officials also discussed how Hong Kong could accelerate reforms to foster progress, enhance cooperation with Guangdong and better integrate into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said he hopes the SAR government would thoroughly implement the spirit of the important speeches by President Xi Jinping in Macau and the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the SAR government is determined to undertake reforms, dare to be innovative, and actively integrate into the national development and align with national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong will co-ordinate development and security, as well as maintain financial and economic security, while promoting the acceleration of economic progress amid a complex external environment.

    Hongkong Post to accept US-bound parcels again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkong Post said it will resume parcel services to the United States from Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they made the announcement after the US confirmed it would not impose additional duty on mail items containing goods from Hongkong Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Hongkong Post stopped accepting US-bound parcels, as the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and the SAR and then reversed the decision in less than a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension by the USPS followed President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports, alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hongkong Post reminds members of the public that the United States government is constantly changing policies and may further change its policies at any time. There may also be backlogs for mail items destined to the United States and delay of delivery, which may cause inconvenience or even losses to the public," a statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also reiterated its strong disapproval of additional US duty imposed on Hong Kong products, and urged Washington "to take urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing".

    'Flavored tobacco ban will further hit bar business'

<img alt="The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said a ban on flavored tobacco and shisha would drive customers away. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791056_1_20250210185326.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A smoking policy concern group on Monday said a government proposal banning flavored cigarettes and shisha products would greatly affect the business of local bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came a day after health minister Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table an amendment of the anti-smoking law at Legco in April, which will include a ban on e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco, among other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Long-term Tobacco Policy Concern Group said according to its survey of 514 bar customers in Lan Kwai Fong and Knutsford Terrace last month, four out of five said they would go to bars less often if the government pushes ahead with the ban, while 70 percent said they will consider visiting bars on the mainland instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association of HK echoed that view, saying "extreme" tobacco-control measures would deal a further blow to the night-time economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Health Bureau said shisha is only allowed in 10 percent of the city's bars, so it won't have a strong impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said the government will consider offering a grace period to bars and patrons before the new law takes effect.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Europe and the United Nations before attending a Group of 20 meeting in South Africa later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry announced on Monday that Wang will visit the UK and Ireland, and attend the Munich Security Conference, from February 12 to 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will co-chair the 10th China-UK Strategic Dialogue during his stay in Britain, and speak about Beijing's position on major international issues at the conference in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang will then be in New York to chair a high-level United Nations Security Council event held by China on February 18 under the theme of "Practicing Multilateralism, Reforming and Improving Global Governance".
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the rotating Security Council president for the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang will next travel to South Africa and attend a G20 foreign ministers' meeting in Johannesburg on February 20 and 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said he would skip the G20 talks over an "anti-American" agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should promote the spirit of partnership, work together to promote world economic growth, guide global governance in a more just and reasonable direction," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said in a regular briefing. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political and tech industry leaders descended on Paris on Monday for a two-day summit on artificial intelligence, hoping to find common ground on the revolutionary technology set to remake business and society across the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the summit aims to lay the groundwork for governing the nascent sector, as global powers race to play leading roles in the fast-developing technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's meeting of around 1,500 guests in the French capital's opulent Grand Palais will feature lectures and panel discussions outlining the promises of and challenges posed by AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Political leaders, including US Vice President JD Vance and Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, are set to rub shoulders with the likes of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A largely suit-wearing crowd of men and women speaking languages from all over the world gathered under the glass-and-steel dome of the great hall, built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selected companies, academics and non-profit groups were showing off their work with AI at stands around the cavernous space decked out with screens and geodesic domes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years on from the emergence of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, able to respond to all kinds of natural-language prompts, "artificial intelligence fuels both immense hopes and, at times, exaggerated fear," Macron's AI envoy Anne Bouverot told guests as she opened the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She promised a "turning point" that would bring more countries on board with AI development that until now has been restricted to a few advanced economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on the agenda is "sustainable development" of the resource- and energy-hungry technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable," Bouverot said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A football legend's no-show at an exhibition match and the sudden closure of a local gym chain have mostly contributed to the rise of complaints filed to Hong Kong's consumer watchdog over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council on Monday said it received 40,839 complaints in total last year, up 20 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding complaints regarding mainland online shopping platforms, the figure stood at 37,590 in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increase was mainly due to two disputes during the year which raised widespread public concern and affected many consumers, including [Lionel] Messi's controversial non-appearance at an exhibition match in February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complaints arising from the two incidents involved about HK$210 million, the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 1,476 complaints relating to Messi and another 5,619 about the fitness chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said "food and entertainment services" remained the category that received the most complaints for the third straight year, with 5,810 cases involving over HK$15.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Food and entertainment-related complaints "still accounted for the lion's share" overall even after excluding certain incidents like Messi's no-show and Physical Fitness' closure, the body added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the watchdog noted the SAR was affected by a number of factors such as the global economic downturn, the boom in the digital economy, the trend of northbound travel, and the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While new traders entered the market, industries were faced with unprecedented opportunities and challenges, and some businesses made the difficult decision to close down, resulting in a surge in related consumer complaints," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged businesses to "promptly improve the quality of services and goods" to be more competitive and appealing, to stimulate people's desire to spend.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

    HKU introduces new blood-cancer treatment

<img alt="The research team says it aims to introduce the treatment to markets in Europe and the US. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791027_1_20250210161527.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine has unveiled a new oral formulation of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, otherwise known as APL.
 <br>
  <br>
  APL is a blood cancer that occurs suddenly with a high fatality rate, leading to bone marrow dysfunction and increased risk of infections and bleeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new treatment, called Oral-ATO, obviates the need for chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant, which decreases the relapse rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clinical Associate Professor at HKU, and the study's lead investigator, Dr Harinder Gill, said that with all abnormal cells gone, around one percent of patients under this treatment experience a relapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So most of these patients are essentially cured with this oral formulation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, patients who take this new treatment do not need to be hospitalised and can just go to an out-patient clinic to collect medications after the initial diagnosis, allowing them to retain a normal life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The production cost for this new oral formula is also much lower than traditional treatments, hence it is currently free and available at all hospitals in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since this is an uncommon form of acute leukaemia, we would have this treatment centralised at Queen Mary Hospital and the University of Hong Kong where these patients would receive meticulous initial supportive care to reduce the early death rate," Dr Gill added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oral-ATO has obtained orphan drug designation from US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research was done in collaboration with experts from around Asia, as well as teams from the UK and the US.

    Do more to get tourists on HK hiking trails: lawmaker

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Vincent Cheng on Monday called for the government to develop more facilities around Hong Kong's hiking trails as a way to attract more tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a charity chaired by Cheng polled more than 380 people from late January to early February. Around half of the respondents agreed there was a lack of water fountains, and almost one-third were concerned about the safety of trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the government could provide more comprehensive information on different trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our suggestions is we do have more professionals to evaluate all trails in Hong Kong, classify them into different difficulties, so we can provide more beginner-friendly trails as well," he said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng added that as well as increasing the number of water fountains and toilets, the administration should set up stations for hikers to get replenishments, taking reference from Japan's mountain houses and Nepal's tea houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of promoting trails globally, Cheng said Hong Kong could participate in international travel exhibitions and invite celebrities such as actor Chow Yun-fat or snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan to become ambassadors.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how to strike a balance between tourism and environmental protection, Cheng said a clear classification of trails will be needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many trails in Hong Kong. Different people have different needs. If we target one or two trails for tourism, we can promote that trail more. Some of the trails, maybe they are for locals, then we can meet local needs," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau has expressed hope for Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) to be flexible and innovative, saying the broadcaster would continue to work with counterparts across the border and in Belt and Road countries to showcase the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development on Monday said RTHK would also promote and broadcast this November's National Games, during a Lunar New Year event organised by the broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I look forward to seeing RTHK strengthen cooperation and exchanges with broadcasters on the mainland and in Belt and Road countries, to demonstrate Hong Kong as a global metropolis where the East meets the West with vibrancy and diversity, to continue to tell the story of Hong Kong," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the broadcaster would promote the city's advantages and characteristics to the rest of the world in the coming year, while jointly introducing a number of programmes with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus for RTHK would be on the use of technology such as artificial intelligence, which Kwan said could break barriers on production.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ecuador will choose its next president in a presidential run-off election after conservative incumbent Daniel Noboa and leftist lawyer Luisa González garnered enough votes on Sunday to beat 14 other candidates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The contest will be a repeat of the October 2023 snap election that earned Noboa a 16-month presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runoff election is set for April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing supporters in Quito, Gonzalez hailed her stronger-than-expected showing against the conservative incumbent as a "victory" for the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by Ecuador’s National Electoral Council after 66 percent of ballots were tallied showed Noboa received more than 3.09 million votes, or 44.7 percent, while González earned over 3.02 million votes, or 43.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Sunday's candidates promised voters to reduce the widespread crime that has plagued the country in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighbouring Colombia and Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  So many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years can turn Ecuador around or if Noboa deserves more time in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador’s National Electoral Council reported that more than 83 percent of the roughly 13.7 million eligible voters cast ballots. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China is further relaxing its visa-free programmes by allowing tour groups from Asean members to visit Xishuangbanna in Yunnan province for up to six days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said the measure came into effect on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tour groups from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia will be allowed to enter and exit the region visa-free via Xishuangbanna Gasa airport, the Mohan Railway or the Mohan Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists must remain in the Xishuangbanna administrative region during their visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration said the move is an important step in expanding the opening up of the country in a structured manner, while bolstering Yunnan's role as a regional hub for South Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the initiative will help promote tourism development, facilitate exchanges between people from China and other countries, and strengthen China-Asean strategic cooperation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles soared to a crushing 40-22 Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, shattering their opponents' bid for a historic hat-trick of NFL titles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for another, as the Eagles avenged their agonising Super Bowl defeat to the Chiefs two years ago in emphatic style at New Orleans' Superdome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been able to use every experience and learn from it – the good, the bad, all of it – to pursue my own greatness," Hurts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I couldn't do any of these things without the guys around me," he added. "We had a special group this year – we were able to learn from the past, get some nice new pieces and get over that hump."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs had been bidding to become the first team in history to win three consecutive Vince Lombardi trophies following Super Bowl victories in 2023 and 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was sacked six times and threw two interceptions, never looked like leading his team to glory as the Eagles' iron defence and clinical offense dominated throughout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles effectively had the game won by half-time, powering into a 24-0 lead at the break after three unanswered touchdowns from Hurts, Cooper DeJean and AJ Brown.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended the lead to 34-0 late in the third quarter before Kansas City finally grabbed three late consolation touchdowns. Eagles kicker Jake Elliott bagged four field goals. (AFP)

    Chinese businesses shrug off Trump tariffs

<img alt="Yiwu city is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790966_1_20250210090937.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traders in China's export manufacturing hub of Yiwu shrugged off US President Donald Trump's tariffs and moves against China on Sunday, with some saying they made preparations to soften the blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yiwu city in eastern Zhejiang province is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items, exporting products ranging from Christmas trees to costume jewellery globally, including to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We predicted that he would assume power," Cheng Haodong, chairman of Beisi Group, a business which sells clothes to water bottles, told Reuters from their office in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After he assumed power, ok, how do we want to adjust? Actually it was prepared for in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They monitored information on overseas social media sites, he added, which led to them establishing a new factory for producing liquid laundry detergent in the US state of Tennessee in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's campaign promised 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports before he was elected. However, he revised that to 10 percent after taking office, which took effect on Tuesday. He also plans to cancel duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This time actually the shock won't be too big for us,” said Cheng, who declined to provide detailed figures on sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beisi exports to other businesses abroad, but also sells some of its products directly to US consumers through online platforms such as Temu and Shein, low-priced shopping sites that analysts expect will be hard hit by Trump's repeal of the 'de minimis' rule - a trade loophole that allowed low-value imports to enter the country duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar sentiments were shared by traders and buyers in the sprawling market in the city, where many were just returning to work after the end of the eight-day Lunar New Year break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Even if) you increase (the tariff) to 50 percent it won't have any effect on us," said Zeng Hao, owner of Jinqi Wanju which sells toys such as brightly-coloured dinosaur figurines.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was because the products are highly profitable and his firm could absorb some of the tariff burden, he said. Companies down the supply chain also have reason to increase their own prices, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abby Jin, who buys products in Yiwu on behalf of other customers in markets such as the US, Australia and the Middle East, said vendors in the city were not short of orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can respond by slighting reducing our profit margins or adjusting costs. In the end, the additional costs will be passed on to the end consumers in their country, meaning they will ultimately bear the consequences of their own economic policies,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the US, whether they can find a suitable country to replace us (as a trade partner) is a question they need to consider themselves." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) is demanding action from relevant authorities after two SAR ice hockey players were injured by their Turkmen counterparts at the Asian Winter Games on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two players are in a stable condition after getting checks by the team doctor and a local hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The altercation came at the end of the men's Group C match between Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan, which the SAR came away 5-1 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua news agency, scuffles broke out when the two sides were shaking hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating on social media showed multiple SAR players on the ice as they were attacked by their opponents. At least one of them, Alvin Sham, looked to be in pain as he clutched his head with both arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees and team officials then quickly intervened and broke up the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match report stated three Turkmen players were assessed "game misconduct" penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SF&OC strongly condemned what it called the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmen athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing video footage, Kenneth Fok, the Chef de Mission of Team Hong Kong, got in touch with relevant authorities and demanded disciplinary action be taken to ensure the personal safety of athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong won all three of its group matches and will fight for a quarter-final slot with Kyrgyzstan on Monday night.

    Trump to announce new steel, aluminium tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

    Plymouth stun Liverpool in FA Cup; Villa beat Spurs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool have suffered a stunning FA Cup exit in a 1-0 defeat to Championship strugglers Plymouth, while Aston Villa inflicted another damaging 2-1 defeat on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's decision to field a weakened team came back to haunt him, with Ryan Hardie's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset and ending Liverpool's quest for a quadruple at Home Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Cody Gakpo were among the stars rested as Slot made 10 changes from the team that thrashed Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a remarkably successful first season in charge of the Reds, it was a rare blunder by the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the fourth time that a team top of the Premier League had been eliminated from the FA Cup by a lower division club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masterminding a famous victory over Liverpool while fighting to haul Plymouth off the bottom of the Championship was no hardship for Argyle manager Miron Muslić, who was a refugee from war-torn Bosnia as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslić–hired by Plymouth to replace the sacked Wayne Rooney in January–was forced to move to Austria aged nine after escaping his home town of Bihac after it fell under siege by Serbian forces in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the third round, but their victory against West Brom last weekend was their first in the league since November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm speechless, and normally they tell me I'm eloquent! It's a big day for us," said Muslic. "It's a magical day. I told the lads in the locker room to enjoy it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the circumstances, Plymouth's superb performance will rank as one of the FA Cup's greatest giant-killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot wore an exasperated expression that summed up Liverpool's lethargy even before Darko Gyabi's overhead kick was blocked by Harvey Elliott's raised arm in the 54th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a clear penalty and Hardie kept his composure to send Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez were denied by fine saves from Conor Hazard in stoppage-time as Home Park erupted in celebration of an astonishing result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, fresh from their thrashing at Anfield to exit the League Cup on Thursday, another chance at ending Spurs' long wait for silverware went awry for the under-fire Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  The writing was on the wall for the visitors after just one minute when goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky let Jacob Ramsey's shot through his grasp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min missed a huge chance to level for an injury-ravaged Tottenham when he was denied by Emiliano Martinez before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Rogers sealed Spurs' fate when he blasted in from close range 25 minutes from time.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has praised China's exceptional capabilities in hosting major sporting events, citing the country's increasing athletic prowess, during his visit to attend the 9th Asian Winter Games underway in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN), Coe reaffirmed that China is "world-class" at staging global events, as he elaborated on the country's impressive track record in hosting successful international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is world-class at staging world class events. We have three world championships in the next 2 years in China. We have the world indoor championships in Nanjing in just a few weeks’ time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We then have the world relays in Guangzhou. And then the jewel in the crown in 2027 in Beijing is our world championships and it was in 2016 at the world championships in Beijing that I got elected as President of World Athletics. So, I consider China to be my lucky country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding his impression of Chinese athletes, Coe noted that he has seen significant progress as a result of close collaboration between World Athletics and major sports institutions in the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe also highlighted that China represents a vast and expanding market for running and athletics, which is playing a crucial role in promoting the participation of young people in sports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The importance of China to world athletics is huge. You have more people that are regularly running than any other country in the world, in 5K's and 10K's and half marathons and marathons. And that is a very large and growing market for world athletics," said the sports body president.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also critical because the Chinese government understands that running and athletics is probably one of the best sports for helping develop the health and vibrancy, both mentally and physically, of young people." (CCTV)

<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates winning his final match against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790942_1_20250210005525.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz clinched his first indoor title on Sunday, overpowering a spirited effort by Australia's Alex de Minaur to win the Rotterdam Open 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz had too much weight of shot off both flanks for his opponent, who retrieved valiantly but lacked the weapons to topple the top seed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz was first to seize the initiative, breaking De Minaur's serve in the third game, helped by a double-fault and some ferocious groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian, ranked eight in the world, struck back, breaking to love in the seventh game to bring the set back on serve at 4-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ill-judged drop shot at 0-30 down in the next game put the pressure back on De Minaur and Alcaraz produced a powerful backhand pass to give himself a chance to serve out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard secured the set at the first time of asking, De Minaur netting a forehand return and giving himself an uphill battle to get back into the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set saw a shift in momentum as De Minaur managed an early break of his own and raced into a 3-0 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur squandered two chances at a second break but clung on to his serve to give himself an opportunity to close out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  He levelled up the match at 1-1, as Alcaraz dumped a backhand into the net, having smashed two wild forehands long out of court earlier in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive set went with serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz got his nose in front, breaking the Australian's serve with a drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur served to stay in the match at 5-2 down but hit a catastrophic double-fault to give Alcaraz two match points.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then pushed a tired-looking backhand into the net to give Alcaraz victory and a 17th tour title, the Spaniard roaring "vamos" as the crowd rose to its feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  For De Minaur, it was a case of deja vu, as he lost in the final last year as well to world number one Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

    Netanyahu says Israel to follow up on Trump Gaza plan

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking on Fox News. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790931_1_20250209211442.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed US President Donald Trump's widely criticised plan to move Palestinians out of the war-battered Gaza Strip, saying Israel is willing to "do the job".
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Fox News interview aired late on Saturday as the premier was wrapping up a visit to Washington, Netanyahu defended Trump's proposal, which has sparked concern and condemnation across the Middle East and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that President Trump's proposal is the first fresh idea in years, and it has the potential to change everything in Gaza," Netanyahu said, adding that it represents a "correct approach" to the future of the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Trump is saying, 'I want to open the gate and give them an option to relocate temporarily while we rebuild the place physically'," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump "never said he wants American troops to do the job. Guess what? We'll do the job," Netanyahu declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel seized the Gaza Strip in 1967 and maintained a military presence in the territory until 2005, when it pulled out settlers and its troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  It subsequently imposed a crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory and placed it under siege after the war began in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and armed groups in Gaza have fought several wars in recent years, but the latest -- sparked by the unprecedented 2023 Hamas attack on Israel -- has been the deadliest and most destructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said Trump's plan was a departure from the "same old, same old, same old -- we leave, Gaza becomes again occupied by these terrorists who use it as a base to attack Israel... It doesn't go anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we should pursue it," he added, cautioning that "the real issue" was finding a country that would agree to take in displaced Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli leader also said that relocated Palestinians would have to "disavow terrorism" to be allowed to return to Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempts to force them out of Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody describes Gaza as the biggest open-air prison in the world," Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get the population out, allow them to leave. Not forcible eviction, not ethnic cleansing -- getting people out of what all these countries and all these do-gooders say is an open-air prison. Why are you keeping them in prison?" (AFP)

  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health chief Lo Chung-mau said the government aims to table anti-smoking legislation at the Legislative Council in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want to further reduce the number of smokers in the SAR and cut down on tobacco products, by banning e-cigarettes and flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, the secretary for health said the measures would be implemented in phases, while also stressing the need to crack down on cigarette smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first will be introducing duty-paid labels, and the second would be heavier fines towards illicit cigarettes. After this, we will move onto other issues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another problem we are concerned about is e-cigarettes. Hong Kong has implemented an import ban in April 2022. Theoretically, no one should be able to buy them. Those who are still having e-cigarettes either have a lot in hand or bought them through illegal channels."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the proposed ban on flavoured tobacco, which Lo said is used by 40 percent of smokers, the health minister said the government will first seek to outlaw non-mint flavoured tobacco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said in future, anyone entering Hong Kong can bring with them 19 flavoured cigarette sticks for personal use without paying tax, and up to 20 packs with tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear smoking led to strong economic losses. "A lot of examples and data tell us when our health is affected by smoking, the economic loss is huge. An HKU study says the economic loss in Hong Kong per year, including medical expenses and loss in manpower due to smoking, reaches more than HK$8 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the government's anti-tobacco policies hope to protect public health without hindering economic development.

  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson came second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half-marathon in about 2 hours and 24 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local designers and creators could reach new horizons by taking advantage of the city's connectivity with the mainland and the rest of the world, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that a number of designers in Hong Kong have become industry leaders amid the rise of the "goods economy" – a market centred on products tied to the universe of anime, comics and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog post, Chan said several designer toys made by Hong Kong creators have been hugely popular in the region, with the cultural products bringing in value worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's designers and creators have a broad vision, and they understand the culture and the needs of the mainland, the Asian and even the international markets," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking advantage of Hong Kong's connectivity to the huge markets on the mainland and the world, as long as they create IP products that are unique, personalised and resonate with the public, they will have a chance to reach new horizons."
  <br>
  <br>
  The cultural and creative industries are crucial to the SAR's social and economic development and are an important component of "Brand Hong Kong", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added branding the city is not only about offering products and services, but also providing unique experiences that demonstrate diversity and promote cultural exchanges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 One person has been found dead and 28 others remained missing, a day after a landslide hit Sichuan Province.
 <br>
  <br>
  It occurred at 11.50am on Saturday in Jinping Village, which is located in Junlian County in the city of Yibin.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of midnight, the landslide had buried 10 residential houses and a production building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people, one seriously and one slightly wounded, have been rescued and were receiving treatment at a hospital in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Due to continuous rainfall and geological conditions, the high-position landslide has transformed into debris flows, which, according to a preliminary assessment, have resulted in an accumulation of debris stretching approximately 1.2 kilometres and having a total volume of over 100,000 cubic metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 people have been evacuated to safety, and 155 have been resettled at a temporary shelter in a school in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sichuan has mobilised 949 personnel from the military, armed police, firefighting, emergency response, transportation, medical, telecommunication, and other forces to carry out or assist the rescue efforts. (Xinhua)

<img alt="People walk in an alley near a popular shopping street in Beijing during the Spring Festival holiday. Officials say an increase in the consumer price index in January is due largely to the influence of the new year break.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, accelerated to its fastest in five months, government data showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI was up 0.5 percent year on year last month, up from the 0.1 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    'Special corridor to help lure talent to HK'

 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, on Sunday said she is planning to propose ways to attract highly-skilled professionals to the SAR and expand a visa scheme during the annual plenary meetings in Beijing next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the focuses is to further promote Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent and help them with accommodation, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to suggest to have a special corridor, just like the stock market connect. If similar arrangements can be established for property usage or property-related expenditure, I think it can facilitate Hong Kong to serve and attract more talent," the National People's Congress Standing Committee member said after a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, our attraction should not focus on the mainland. We should attract talent globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will be one of the SAR delegates attending the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings, also known as the Two Sessions, in the capital in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another idea she wants to raise in Beijing is the expansion of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents, to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area with Guangzhou being the priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also spoke about the challenges facing Hong Kong amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the situation is complex and complicated. The Hong Kong government should work closely with the central government on the one hand," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, we should maintain our international contact with different parts of the world, so as to continue to bring more talent, resources and technology through Hong Kong to our country."

<img alt="The new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam has vowed to reform Lebanon’s judiciary and battered economy. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790854_1_20250209024624.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon’s new prime minister on Saturday formed the country’s first full-fledged government since 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Joseph Aoun announced in a statement that he had accepted the resignation of the former caretaker government and signed a decree forming the new government with new Prime Minister Nawaf Salam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam, a diplomat and former president of the International Court of Justice, vowed to “restore confidence between citizens and the state, between Lebanon and its Arab surroundings, and between Lebanon and the international community” and to implement reforms needed to bring the country out of an extended economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Reform is the only path to a true salvation,” he said in a speech on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also promised to follow up on the implementation of a ceasefire agreement that ended the most recent war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah in late November and to ensure that Israeli forces “withdraw from Lebanese territory until the last inch.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged to ensure reconstruction in areas that suffered destruction during the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salam’s cabinet of 24 ministers, split evenly between Christian and Muslim sects, was formed less than a month after he was appointed and comes at a time when Lebanon is scrambling to rebuild its battered southern region and maintain security along its borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though Hezbollah did not endorse Salam as prime minister, the group did engage in negotiations with the new prime minister over the Shiite Muslim seats in government, as per Lebanon’s power-sharing system.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was despite comments by US envoy Morgan Ortagus, who said in a speech in Beirut Friday that Washington had “set clear red lines from the United States” and that Hezbollah would not be “a part of the government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments drew backlash from many in Lebanon who saw them as meddling in internal Lebanese affairs. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma sealed a 2-1 win in the fourth-round of the FA Cup to dash Chelsea's hopes, while Kevin De Bruyne spared Manchester City's blushes in their 2-1 victory at third-tier Leyton Orient on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea haven't won a domestic trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2018 and their wait will go on for another season after they blew the lead at the Amex Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were gifted the lead in the fifth minute when Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen fumbled Cole Palmer's cross into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a horrendous mistake but Chelsea failed to press home their advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thrashed 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League last weekend, Brighton bounced back impressively from the second worst defeat in the club's 123-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They equalised in the 12th minute as Joel Veltman's cross reached Georginio Rutter, who found space between Chelsea defenders Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo to flick a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Brighton completed their fightback in the 57th minute when Mitoma clipped a deft finish past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez despite the visitors' claim for handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated," Maresca said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1. But you have to take the consequence of the result."
  <br>
  <br>
  At Brisbane Road, Manchester City were rocked when Jamie Donley's long-range effort came back off the bar and rebounded in off City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give Orient an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions finally drew level after 56 minutes when Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov deflected in Rico Lewis's shot for his first goal since signing for City from Lens in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola had to turn to his bench more than he would have liked just four days before a mammoth Champions League play-off round first leg against Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of De Bruyne made the difference as the Belgian midfielder scored 11 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable. For the fans, how the crowd support and we knew they are strong," said Guardiola, who saw deadline day signing Nico Gonzalez hobble off injured in the first half of his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle came from behind to win 3-2 against Birmingham at St Andrew's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birmingham led after 42 seconds through Ethan Laird's deflected strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  A quickfire double from Joe Willock and Callum Wilson turned the tie in Newcastle's favour, but Tomoki Iwata's blistering strike levelled before half-time for the League One leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, though, rounded off a fine week after reaching the League Cup final on Wednesday as Willock restored their lead on 82 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bottom of the Premier League and seemingly destined for relegation, Southampton got no respite in the FA Cup as Burnley won 1-0 at St Mary's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Parker's team went in front after 77 minutes when Marcus Edwards scored from close range on his debut after signing on loan from Sporting Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is almost 600 minutes since Championship promotion chasers Burnley last conceded a goal, with 10 clean sheets in their last 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were unlucky to lose to a scrappy goal. We did lots of good things and created lots of opportunities," Southampton boss Ivan Juric said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last FA Cup tie at Goodison Park, Everton, who are moving to a new stadium next season, were beaten 2-0 by Bournemouth thanks to goals from Antoine Semenyo and Dan Jebbison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz scored twice as Fulham won 2-1 at League One Wigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich, second bottom of the Premier League, swept to a 4-1 win against Frank Lampard's Coventry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall reached the fifth round for the first time since 2018-19 thanks to Femi Azeez's double in a 2-0 win at Championship leaders Leeds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge issued an emergency order early on Saturday blocking Elon Musk's government reform team from accessing personal and financial data stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Paul A Engelmayer's order restricts giving access to Treasury Department payment systems and other data to "all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  The temporary restrictive order, which remains in effect until a February 14 hearing, also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department's records since Donald Trump was inaugurated as president on January 20 must "immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, is leading Trump's federal cost-cutting efforts under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was brought against Trump, the Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday by attorneys general from 19 states.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorneys general alleged the administration violated the law by expanding access to sensitive Treasury Department data to staff from Musk's Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Engelmayer's order said the states that sued would "face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk ran into controversy last week with reports he and his team were accessing sensitive data stored at the Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  An internal assessment from the Treasury called the Doge team's access to federal payment systems "the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced," US media reported. (AFP)

    Baltic nations disconnect from Russian power grid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Baltic states on Saturday cut ties with Russia's power grid to join the European Union's network, the culmination of a years-long process that gained urgency with Moscow's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – all former Soviet republics now in the European Union and Nato – had wanted to block Russia's ability to geopolitically blackmail them via the electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have removed any theoretical possibility of Russia using energy (grid) control as a weapon," Lithuania's Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas – Estonia's former prime minister – had on Friday hailed the grid switch as "a victory for freedom and European unity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaiciunas said the Baltic states had completed the disconnection process at 9:09 local time (0709 GMT) on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been waiting for this moment for a long time," he told reporters, after speaking with his Estonian and Latvian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The energy system of the Baltic states is finally in our own hands. We are in control," he added of the "historic" moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Baltics were now operating in so-called "isolated mode" before they integrate with the European grid on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official celebrations are planned across the Baltics, and authorities were on guard for any potential cyber-attacks linked to the grid switch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latvia will physically cut a power line to Russia later on Saturday and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is to attend a ceremony with Baltic leaders in Vilnius on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Baltics have long prepared to integrate with the European grid but faced technological and financial issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The switch became more urgent after Russia started its war in Ukraine in 2022, spooking the Baltic states into thinking they could be targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stopped purchasing Russian gas and electricity after the war began, but their power grids remained connected to Russia and Belarus, controlled by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  This left them dependent on Moscow for a stable electricity flow, which is crucial for factories and facilities requiring a reliable power supply. (AFP)

    Hamas frees three Israeli hostages in fifth Gaza swap

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas released three Israeli hostages on Saturday, the fifth group freed under a fragile Gaza ceasefire, with Israel condemning their "cruel" handover and worrying physical appearance.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Israel expected to release 183 prisoners in exchange, witnesses in the occupied West Bank saw a bus carrying freed Palestinians leave an Israeli jail and later arrive in the city of Ramallah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth exchange since the truce took effect last month comes as negotiations are set to begin on a more permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after President Donald Trump floated a proposal for the United States to take over the Gaza Strip and clear out its inhabitants, sparking global outrage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Or Levy, Ohad Ben Ami and Eli Sharabi, who were all seized by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the 15-month war, "crossed the border into Israeli territory," the Israeli military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jubilant crowds in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv cheered as they watched live footage of the three hostages, flanked by masked gunmen, brought on stage in Deir el-Balah before being handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the joy of their release was quickly overtaken by concern for their condition, with all three appearing thin and pale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The choreographed handover included forced statements from the three on stage, in which they stated support for finalising the next phases of the Israel-Hamas truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The disturbing images... serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt – there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out," said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose dejected-looking image appeared on a banner at the Deir el-Balah handover site, said that the images out of Gaza were "shocking."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's President Isaac Herzog denounced the treatment of the hostages who were paraded on stage, calling it "a crime against humanity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole world must look directly at Ohad, Or, and Eli – returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained – being exploited in a cynical and cruel spectacle by vile murderers," Herzog said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharabi, 52, was at his home in Kibbutz Beeri with his British-born wife and their two daughters when militants stormed it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed men shot their dog, before locking the family in their safe room and setting it on fire. The bodies of his wife and two daughters were later identified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ben Ami, who has dual Israeli-German citizenship, turned 56 in captivity. He was abducted from his home in Beeri along with his wife, who was released during the war's first truce in November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levy was abducted from the Nova music festival, where gunmen murdered his wife.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former hostage Yarden Bibas, who was freed last week by Hamas militants in Gaza, on Friday urged Netanyahu to help bring back his wife and two children from the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Netanyahu, I'm now addressing you with my own words... bring my family back, bring my friends back, bring everyone home," Bibas said in his first public message following his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas previously said his wife Shiri and his two sons Ariel and Kfir – the youngest hostages – were dead, but Israel has not confirmed their deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hostage and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government on Friday to stick with the Gaza truce, even as Trump's comments sparked backlash across the Middle East and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An entire nation demands to see the hostages return home," the Israeli campaign group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time to ensure the agreement is completed – until the very last one," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian militants have so far freed 21 hostages in exchange for hundreds of mostly Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, aims to secure the release of 11 more hostages during the first 42-day phase of the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire were set to begin on Monday, but there have been no details on the status of the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu's office said that after Saturday's swap, an Israeli delegation will head to Doha for further talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second phase aims to secure the release of more hostages and pave the way for a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  During their October 2023 attack, militants took 251 hostages to Gaza. Seventy-three remain in captivity, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliation has killed at least 47,583 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The United Nations considers the figures reliable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A key Indian opposition leader and the former chief minister of the capital province Delhi lost his seat in local elections on Saturday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party tipped for victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arvind Kejriwal lost his seat to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to election commission results, reflecting expected wider losses by his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has governed the sprawling megacity of more than 30 million people for most of the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's BJP is in government in the national parliament, but has not controlled the local legislature in the capital New Delhi since 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chanting BJP supporters danced in joy outside its New Delhi headquarters as vote results from the election on Wednesday were counted, waving flags and posters of Modi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Counting continues -- with the AAP and BJP level on nine declared seats -- but the election commission say Modi's party is leading in more than two-thirds of the 70-seat assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our victory is a sign of the people's faith in Prime Minister Modi's vision of progress," interior minister and BJP stalwart Amit Shah said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Delhi mandate shows that people can't be misled with lies every time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, who rode to power as an anti-corruption crusader a decade ago, spent several months behind bars last year on accusations his party took kickbacks in exchange for liquor licences, along with several fellow party leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal has denied wrongdoing and characterised the charges as a political witch hunt by Modi's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was one of the key pillars of an opposition block formed ahead of India's general elections last year, when the BJP suffered significant losses despite holding on to power. (AFP)

 With the recent flurry of tariffs and policy announcements by US President Donald Trump, there's been increasing discourse in Hong Kong over economic responses and adaptation, including in the upcoming budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive councillor Chan Kin-por on Saturday urged the public to see the reasoning behind the government's need to prune spending and pare its fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Chan, who is also an insurance sector lawmaker, said that when Financial Secretary Paul Chan hands down his budget on February 26, he has to show that he's in control of government expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The financial secretary is under great pressure this time around. If he fails to control expenditure, it may affect Hong Kong’s credit rating. The situation is grim. I hope Hong Kong people can understand that there's no choice but to cut spending,” Chan Kin-por said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government can consider cutting staff-related expenditures, while spending on welfare, such as Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and benefits for the elderly, can remain at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about how geopolitics and tariffs would affect Hong Kong's economy, Chan Kin-por said there would be a negative impact, but he believes there will be appropriate response measures from both the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, the chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he supports the SAR government's decision to file a complaint to World Trade Organization over Washington imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on Hong Kong products.

 Roughly 1.4 million tourists came to Hong Kong during the eight-day mainland Spring Festival golden week, including 1.2 million visitors from the mainland, according to the executive director of the Travel Industry Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fanny Yeung told an RTHK programme on Saturday that of the total, about 79,000 people visited in tour groups - 83 percent of which stayed overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung was optimistic with the fact that 15 percent of those from tour groups had stayed two or three nights in the SAR - an uptick from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although the number of inbound tourists dropped, they stayed here for longer and we are happy to see this phenomenon,” Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the city needs more tour guides who can speak foreign languages other than Chinese and English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said some travel agencies were unable to host group tours from countries like Thailand, as they could not find guides who speak Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu said the hotel occupancy rate reached about 90 percent during the golden week, and room rates dropped about 10 percent compared to last year.

    'Remains to be seen when flu season will peak'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It remains uncertain when the flu season is likely to peak, according to the Director of Health.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Ronald Lam told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that the H1 influenza A virus is now the dominant strain - as detected in over 90 percent of the specimen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The flu season has (arrived) since January this year, and we are seeing the rise in flu activity, and also right now the flu activity remains at a high level. But we cannot confirm how and when the flu activity will reach its peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The schools are going to resume classes after the holidays, so there's still possibility that there will be further transmission of flu in the community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam revealed that there were 137 death cases among adults, and over 75 percent of them were not vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from appealing to the public to get their flu jabs, he also called on those planning to travel abroad to reschedule their trips if they feel unwell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to learn more about the situation about the destinations, like whether or not the place they're going to is experiencing a big flu season," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for those who have chronic illness... diabetes, hypertension, kidney diseases and so forth, they should seek medical consultation first to get timely advice regarding what they should be aware of and what medications they should bring along with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  While some members of the public undergo self-testing for flu using rapid antigen kits, Lam noted they should check if the kits are listed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the public to only take flu medication after consulting a physician, as they often comes with side effects.

    Trump pauses de minimis repeal on Chinese imports

<img alt="President Trump's ban had created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790798_1_20250208113211.jpg&q=50">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis." (Reuters)

    Maguire lifts Man Utd over Leicester in FA Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Maguire headed a last-gasp winner as FA Cup holders Manchester United came from behind to beat Leicester 2-1 on Friday, denying Ruud van Nistelrooy a fairytale return to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bobby De Cordova-Reid put the Premier League strugglers ahead late in the first half of the fourth-round tie against a pallid United, who have lost their fear factor at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of Alejandro Garnacho at half-time gave United a different dimension and fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee levelled midway through the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's team pushed for a winner and it finally came when former Leicester defender Maguire headed in a Bruno Fernandes' free-kick deep into stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese manager, who is struggling to implement his ideas at Old Trafford three months into his reign, said it was a "poor performance" from his side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't have any energy in the beginning, especially in the first half," he told ITV. "Then in the second half we played a little bit better, with a little more speed, winning second balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then we managed to turn things around so it was a good result but not a good performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The coach is the first responsible. When one team doesn't perform, doesn't improve, it is the coach but we are here to do things and to see the game, to study the game and try to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  United scored eight goals in two games against Leicester earlier in the campaign during Van Nistelrooy's brief spell as interim boss at Old Trafford following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this time their former star striker was in the opposition dugout.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who beat Manchester City in the final at Wembley last May, were short of confidence after five defeats in their past seven matches at home in all competitions. (AFP)

    'Small AI chip firms can benefit from DeepSeek tide'
   </title>

<img alt="Analysts say DeepSeek will boost the global proliferation of smaller AI chip firms. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790790_1_20250208102758.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The global recognition of Chinese AI star, DeepSeek, is expected to serve as a catalyst for small AI chip companies to massively scale up around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hangzhou-based startup rattled Silicon Valley last month with the launch of its low-cost, but powerful AI model, which wiped out around half a trillion US dollars in chip leader Nvidia's market cap because it was built without using cutting edge chips, due to American export restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Trending China programme, Esther Wong, founder of 3C AGI Partners, noted that DeepSeek's breakthrough came as the global AI cycle transitioned from "training" to "inferencing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Inference refers to the act of applying AI to make predictions or decisions based on the processing of new information and data in real time, instead of training the AI model to learn patterns, relationships or features.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's equivalent to Generative AI, more focused on AI's real applications where AI can serve users differently in a tailored way," Wong explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So if] inferencing is going to be used by some seven billion people in the world. You can imagine the explosion of demand is going to be so much that in the words of Jensen Huang, the inferencing demand is literally one billion times bigger than the training demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] If we do not change how AI is being manufactured now, the world will run out of power very, very soon," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who previously worked as managing director at Chinese AI leader SenseTime, noted the new opportunities following DeepSeek's rise as the firm's open-source model would help other small AI chip firms to challenge the current market landscape that is dominated by big players such as Nvidia, with investors eyeing alternatives to their chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The moment DeepSeek emerged, it can actually help the proliferation of all those basic chips, i.e. chips apart from Nvidia, that are also very good for inferencing purposes. And that applies for both domestic chips in China or chips produced by startups in the West," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran banker and investor also stressed that despite the narratives that AI breakthroughs could be achieved with smaller computing power and lower investments, demand for such power as well as funds would only increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inferencing demand is one billion times bigger than the training demand, and by making inferencing so cheap and accessible [due to DeepSeek's model being open-sourced], we actually need a lot more computing powers so that more people can afford inferencing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are seeing that the Large Language Models [LLMs] are quickly being commoditised, so it's difficult to make money out of it because the marginal cost of producing intelligence is close to zero. But that is very good for the application layers where a lot of usage can be proliferated as they can be commercialised."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said. "We don't want any more, any less."
  <br>
  <br>
  The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower on fears of a possible trade war, with investors also concerned by the latest US unemployment data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790781_1_20250208083003.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and European shares fell Friday, with the latest US jobs report and higher inflation expectations capping the end of a volatile week marked by concerns over a trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data showed the United States added fewer jobs than expected in January while unemployment ticked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobs data missed expectations, but Wall Street's three main indexes initially rose. They quickly fell into the red, however, after separate data showed US consumers now expect inflation to jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down one percent at 44,303.40, the S&P 500 also lost one percent to 6,025.99 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 percent to finish at 19,523.40.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Trump's remarks on unspecified "reciprocal tariffs" also appeared to reignite concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he was "probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday," saying that this would be "opposed to a flat-fee tariff" approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's (jobs) data does not show a large enough divergence from expectations to shift what is expected to be the Fed's next rate move," said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still the Fed is expected to cut the Fed Funds rate twice this year and today's data does not really give a hint into when the first cut will be," Stanzl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed kept its rate unchanged last week, with chair Jerome Powell saying the central bank was in no "hurry" to adjust borrowing costs again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labor Department said total US employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, which was significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January figure was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000 according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think that the labour market data shifts the dial for the Fed," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  But data released afterward subsequently showed US consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in July, with survey respondents reporting feeling less confident and more concerned about inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 4.3 percent, up a full percentage point from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such a substantial one-month rise of one percentage point or more has occurred only five times in the past 14 years," noted Axel Rudolph, Senior Technical Analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in inflation expectations follows a turbulent week for stock markets and currencies after Trump imposed tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US leader also warned that the European Union would face tariffs "pretty soon" while he delayed duties on Canada and Mexico at the 11th hour. (AFP)

    London's Grenfell Tower to be taken down after fire

<img alt='A UK public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable." File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790752_1_20250207225504.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Grenfell Tower – where 72 people died in 2017 in Britain's worst residential fire since World War II – is to be demolished, the UK government confirmed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, which is expected to take two years, has angered some survivors and families of those killed in the massive inferno, which destroyed the 24-storey block in the west of Britain's capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Grenfell Tower will be carefully taken down to the ground," the government said in a statement, confirming what victims' groups said on Thursday they had been told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The work will start after the eighth anniversary of the blaze on June 14 and will be done carefully to ensure that materials can be included in any future memorial, the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said safety was the primary reason for the demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It remains stable because of the measures put in place to protect it, but even with the installation of additional props, the condition of the building will continue to worsen over time," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Engineers also advise it is not practicable to retain many of the floors of the building in place as part of a memorial that must last in perpetuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire started in a faulty freezer, spreading rapidly due to highly combustible cladding fixed to the building's exterior.
  <br>
  <br>
  A public inquiry last year found the 72 deaths were "all avoidable" and blamed the "systematic dishonesty" of building firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also revealed decades-long government and regulatory failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the inquiry and report, victims' groups have criticised the government for failing to implement fire safety recommendations swiftly enough, including removing similar cladding from other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families have also condemned the delay in bringing criminal charges against those blamed for the disaster in the inquiry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to demolish the building divided victim groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grenfell United, which represents some of the survivors and families, said on Thursday the decision was "disgraceful" and that victims were ignored by a short consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Grenfell Next of Kin said it was a "sensitive decision" that "came after a thorough engagement process" and was informed by "safety concerns" surrounding the structural integrity of the scaffolded remains of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government insisted that deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who also holds the housing brief, has offered the community several discussions online and in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear from conversations it remains a sacred site. It is also clear that there is not a consensus about what should happen to it," the government said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being able to see the tower every day helps some people continue to feel close to those they lost. For others, it is a painful reminder of what happened and is having a daily impact on some members of the community." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday declared the 2025 Asian Winter Games officially open in Harbin, marking the second time the northeastern Chinese city has hosted the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was joined by First Lady Peng Liyuan, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, at the extravaganza in Heilongjiang province.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd at the Harbin International Conference, Exhibition and Sports Centre cheered loudly as Team Hong Kong, China were among 34 competing countries and regions introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's short track speed skater, Lam Ching-yan, and alpine skier, Adrian Yung, were the flag bearers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city has sent 74 athletes to the Games, the most ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  Timothy Fok, vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, said China had played a big part in the growth of winter sports in the continent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A record number of over 1,200 athletes from a record number of 34 National Olympic Committees will be competing in Harbin, and this shows the remarkable development of winter sports in Asia," he said at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has played a big part in this, not only by staging two previous Asian Winter Games in 1996 and 2007, but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the loudest of cheers was reserved for the hosts, the last of the teams introduced, with China having the biggest team of 170 athletes at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national team's flag bearers were speed skater Ning Zhongyan and freeskier Liu Mengting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guests and athletes were then treated to traditional Chinese performances at the ceremony.

    'Chinese e-commerce firms can prevail despite tariffs'

<img alt="E-commerce businesses such as Shein or Temu must adopt long-term shipping planning to offset the additional duties imposed by the US, analysts say. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790724_1_20250207185909.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese e-commerce companies would still be able to maintain healthy financial positions in the face of surging US tariffs - if they fine tune their business models with long-term planning, according to analysts.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the US on Monday revoked a long-standing de minimis rule that allowed packages worth less than US$800 to enter the country duty-free, as part of measures when US President Donald Trump signed the executive order to impose an extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes, while slapping additional duties on Chinese e-commerce firms such as Temu and Shein, could still offer an opportunity for them, if they conduct shipping planning intelligently, according to Catherine Lim, a senior consumer analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bear in mind that some of these [de minimis shipments] are very random parcels that did not require inventory planning about shipping, like what most export-oriented products do, particularly those above the US$800 threshold," Lim told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest change I would say right now for these e-commerce sellers who are using the de minimis is that they need to adopt longer-term planning. They need to start restructuring themselves so much so that they will have enough goods ahead of time at Temu's or Shein's specified warehouses, while still being in a position to actually distribute to the local consumers, to meet the demand of the US shoppers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will offset the entire financial impact from the tariff hikes."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the ways, she suggested, was for the mainland firms to shift away from aviation transport which is around 25 to 30 times more expensive than sea freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lim said she believes there still could be turnarounds in terms of the trade policies from the US, as supply chain management processes undertake new regulations while authorities from China and the US, as well as the rest of the world, take steps to address the new procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go through a rather volatile couple of months, but this is temporary," Lim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Into the second half of the year, I am expecting, barring any unforeseen changes to trade policies that this will start to stabilise into the end of the year."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Friday said it would file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation over the United States' decision to impose an additional 10 percent tariffs on Hong Kong products.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said the US measure was “grossly inconsistent” with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that Washington had ignored that the city is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law, and recognised by the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government will formally launch procedures in accordance with the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism against the US' unreasonable measures to defend our legitimate rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR supports the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government urged the US to rectify its measures immediately.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celsius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.
