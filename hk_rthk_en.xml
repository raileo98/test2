<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has proposed that employers who lose their jobs after their companies go bankrupt can get as much as HK$200,000 of severance pay - double the current ceiling.
 <br>
  <br>
  They will also get half of any more money owed to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-gratia payments, that are made by the government's Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), also cover unpaid wages, pay for untaken annual leave and statutory holidays, as well as payment in lieu of notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said it expects the move to allow 86 percent of the applicants to obtain their severance payment in full.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With an average of some 3,000 applications received annually and an accumulated surplus of over HK$7.2 billion as at December 2023, PWIF was financially sound enough to cope with the possible increase in applications,” it reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK radio programme on Thursday, Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel said he welcomed the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no-one abuses the fund, I think the number of applications will remain similar at around 3,000 cases each year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when the economy is poor, I think there will be only 4,000 to 5,000 cases. To a fund that has more than HK$7 billion, it's financially sound in the long run."
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Legco panel on manpower are set to discuss the matter on Monday.

    HKGCC predicts 2.3 GDP growth in 2025

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Thursday predicted real GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2025, along with a headline inflation rate of 2.0 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman Agnes Chan said this was a cautiously optimistic prediction, and expressed confidence in central government and SAR government measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC said that in a survey it carried out last month, more than 60 percent of 219 companies questioned reported increased or stable business turnover this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 18 percent said they had a positive outlook for the local economy in the next 12 months, while 45 percent held a negative view.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Doris Fung said that many unpredictable factors can be behind the firms' worries, such as uncertain growth rates in Europe and the potential for a trade war following Donald Trump's re-election as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are also confident in the Hong Kong business community, they are more prepared this time with the new US government," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that about half of the companies do not plan to either hire or cut staff, and about 40 percent plan to increase salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 percent of the respondents said they don't expect to change their capital investment plans over the next year, the HKGCC said.

 The Houston Rockets edged Golden State 91-90 for their first win over the Warriors since 2020, as they reach the semi-finals of the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teammate Jalen Green's 12 points, including the game-winning free-throws with 3.5 seconds remaining, helped Houston end a run of 15 straight losses to the Warriors stretching back to February 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets booked an NBA Cup last-four showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Atlanta Hawks, fueled by 22 points and 11 assists from Trae Young, erased a 10-point third-quarter deficit to beat the New York Knicks 108-100 and book an NBA Cup semi-final against the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hawks point guard Young, the player Knicks fans have loved to hate since Atlanta's 2021 playoff series triumph over New York, came alive in the second half to get the Hawks offense firing after the Knicks dominated the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored 12 points and handed out nine assists after the break, directing a balanced Hawks attack that was led by 24 points from forward De'Andre Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big game, especially for us," Young said after the Hawks punched their ticket to the NBA Cup final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just try to play for each other and play til the end, and that's what we did." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources company on Thursday said the hiring intentions of local companies will be more conservative in the first quarter of next year, amid a slowdown of the global economy and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  ManpowerGroup said it interviewed about 500 local employers and around 35 percent thought they would increase staff numbers in the coming three months, while 28 percent said they would need to downsize.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior vice president with the group, Lancy Chui, said some sectors will face challenges, including goods and services and transport and logistics, due to a change in consumption patterns and tax-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said various policies and events will be favourable for some sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents will be an opportunity. Also, Hong Kong is now promoting a mega event economy. This will stimulate local and tourist consumption. It's also the peak season for festive spending, so it will boost the atmosphere for consumption," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said the employment outlook for the first quarter of next year stands at +6%, marking a two percentage point drop when compared with this quarter.

<img alt="Janet Yellen says China and the US should maintain communications to prevent ties from worsening. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783166_1_20241212133218.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economic officials in outgoing US President Joe Biden's administration are set to meet their Chinese counterparts this week for talks, in a final effort to strengthen ties before Donald Trump's White House return.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks come as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed in an interview on Wednesday the need for "ongoing communications at all levels" to avoid needless worsening in relations between the world's two biggest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economic and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have continued to flare during Biden's time in office. But temperatures could rise further under Trump, who has threatened sweeping tariff increases on Chinese goods ahead of his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's critical to have open channels of communication," Yellen told Bloomberg Television, warning that Trump's universal tariffs proposal would likely trigger retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh is due to meet Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min for an economic working group meeting on the sidelines of Group of 20 talks in South Africa, said the US Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States and China are the two largest economies on the globe, and the American people expect that we should be able to communicate directly with Chinese officials on both areas where we agree and especially on areas where we don't," said Shambaugh.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury officials and representatives from other agencies will travel to the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing as well, for a financial working group meeting taking place on Sunday and Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's delegation is expected to be headed by People's Bank of China deputy governor Xuan Changneng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect US clean energy businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The notice from the US Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50 percent and duties on certain tungsten products will increase to 25 percent, effective on January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains,” US Trade Representative Katharine Tai said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the US of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the US. (AFP/AP)

    New Syria PM promises to protect minority rights

<img alt="Syria's new transitional prime minister Mohammad al-Bashir has pledged to protect the rights of all Syrians as the country moves to form a new government. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783164_1_20241212131357.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new interim prime minister pledged to protect minority rights as Washington's top diplomat flew to the region on Thursday to urge an "inclusive" transition after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad al-Bashir has said he will only remain in power until March.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new coalition of rebel groups has yet to spell out key details of the transition process, including its thinking on a new constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are bringing (ministers) from one colour, there should be participation of others," said Zakaria Malahifji, secretary general of the Syrian National Movement who once served as political advisor to rebels in Aleppo. He said the lack of consultation in forming an interim government was a misstep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian society is diverse in terms of cultures, ethnicities, so frankly this is concerning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria last Sunday after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies, which brought a spectacular end to five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration after enduring decades during which suspected dissidents were jailed or killed, and nearly 14 years of war that killed 500,000 people and displaced millions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joy sparked by Assad's overthrow has been accompanied by uncertainty about the future of the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its new rulers have sought to reassure minorities they will be protected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria," Mohammad al-Bashir, the transitional head of government until March 1, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new rulers have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad's iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani vowing that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, also urged "countries to hand over any of those criminals who may have fled so they can be brought to justice".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top US diplomat Antony Blinken is on Thursday in Jordan, his first stop on a regional tour that will see him offer American support for "an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will call for Syria to avoid becoming a "base of terrorism" or "posing a threat to its neighbours" -- a nod to the concerns of Turkey and Israel, both of which have carried out strikes inside Syria since Assad's fall. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifa on Wednesday confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, underlining the Gulf kingdom's growing influence in world sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, a virtual Congress of world football's governing body confirmed that Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be joint hosts of the 2030 World Cup, in which three games will also be played in South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid was waved through by acclamation during the meeting of Fifa's 211 national member associations, with no rivals standing in its way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a proud day, a day of celebration, a day that we invite the entire world to Saudi Arabia," said Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We intend to have an extraordinary version of the World Cup in our kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to condemnation from rights groups, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said his organisation is inclusive and non-discriminatory. “We want to obtain positive social impact," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of course aware of critics and fears, and I fully trust our hosts to address all open points from this process and deliver a Fifa World Cup which meets expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "social improvements and positive human rights impacts" are "responsibilities of hosting a World Cup". (AFP)

<img alt="President Yoon Suk Yeol's inner circle has come under intense scrutiny for their role in last week's martial law declaration. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783127_2_20241212091257.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean president on Thursday defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  In televised remarks, Yoon Suk Yeol lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces", said North Korea has hacked the country's elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came hours before the main liberal opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him. The opposition party plans to put the motion on a floor vote this Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the address, Yoon vowed to "fight with the people until the very last minute".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I apologise again to the people who must have been surprised and anxious due to the martial law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please trust me in my warm loyalty to the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition’s earlier attempt to impeach Yoon fell through last Saturday, with ruling party lawmakers boycotting a vote at the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's inner circle has come under intense scrutiny for their role in last week's martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prison authorities on Wednesday said former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun tried to kill himself shortly before his formal arrest the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two senior police officials were also arrested early on Wednesday. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Thursday advanced to the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old qualified after finishing fifth overall in the semi-finals, where she clocked a time of 51.83 seconds. American Gretchen Walsh topped the rankings with a 50.49-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final round is set to begin at 12.32am on Friday, Hong Kong time.

    Firefly Sparkle galaxy sparks delight among stargazers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope has spotted a young galaxy dating to the early universe – called Firefly Sparkle because its gleaming star clusters resemble the bioluminescent bugs – in a discovery that is giving astronomers a peek at what our Milky Way may have looked like in its infancy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the galaxy, still in the process of assembling, dates to when the universe was roughly 5 percent of its current age, about 600 million years after the Big Bang event that initiated the cosmos. It has a mass equal to about 10 million stars the size of our sun, and has two other relatively small galaxies as neighbours, dubbed Firefly-Best Friend and Firefly-New Best Friend.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is comprised of 10 densely packed star clusters embedded in a diffuse arc of stars, eight in its central region and two along its extended arm. Its main visible portion spans about 1,000 light-years across. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
  <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy is estimated to have formed 100-400 million years before its evolutionary stage that was observed by Webb, the most capable space telescope ever deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Milky Way began forming very early in the universe's history, likely around the same time as Firefly Sparkle," said astronomer Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts and the Centre for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics in Bangladesh, co-lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pachuca of Mexico bested Brazilian side Botafogo 3-0 on Wednesday in the Intercontinental Cup to reach the next stage of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half strikes from Pachuca's Oussama Idrissi, Nelson Deossa and Salomón Rondón gave the North American continental champions victory over their South American counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really emotional," said Pachuca coach Guillermo Almada. "It was a party in the stadium with all the supporters from Pachuca and Botafogo that came here – it was a football party."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very happy," he added. "We're already thinking about the next game, which could be even more difficult than this one."
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the all-American clash progress to the next round of the new Intercontinental Cup format, where they will meet CAF Champions League winners Al Ahly of Egypt on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid, the current Uefa Champions League holders, lie in wait in the final four days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pachuca qualified for the tournament as victors of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup – following their 3-0 win in the final against MLS side Columbus Crew in early June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat put a dampener on a brilliant fortnight for Botafogo in which they won the Copa Libertadores and wrapped up the Brazilian Serie A.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't look for an excuse," said Botafogo coach Artur Jorge. "Pachuca were better than us, more efficient and more capable in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old Portuguese guided the Rio club to a first-ever Copa Libertadores and a first domestic league title since 1995 this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't the result we wanted, but we had an extraordinary year, made history," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal midfielder Bukayo Saka celebrates scoring. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783113_1_20241212073858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka's double fired Arsenal a step closer to the Champions League last 16 as the England forward inspired a 3-0 win against Monaco on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Saka netted late in each half and Kai Havertz struck in the closing minutes at the Emirates Stadium to lift Mikel Arteta's side into third place in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have won four of their six European games this term and, with two matches remaining, they control their destiny in the race for the top-eight finish that guarantees automatic progress to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clubs that finish ninth to 24th in the 36-team first phase face a play-off to determine if they will advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  With games against Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come in January, the north Londoners will be confident of avoiding that unwanted obstacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a damaging 1-1 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Arsenal's fifth win in their last six games in all competitions was a welcome tonic.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Arsenal's defensive injury crisis showing no signs of abating, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ben White, Riccardo Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Takehiro Tomiyasu were all absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey started out of position at right-back despite missing training on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly, 18, came in at left-back for just his second Arsenal start, with his other coming in the League Cup against third-tier Bolton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest player to start a Champions League match for Arsenal since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, Lewis-Skelly rose to the occasion with a composed display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Gabriel Jesus has gone 32 games without a goal for Arsenal and the Brazilian's lack of confidence was clear in the hosts' first dangerous attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Picked out by Gabriel Martinelli's pass, Jesus should have hit the target but could only muster a tame shot straight at Monaco keeper Radoslaw Majecki.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus failed to time his run well enough to reach Mikel Merino's teasing cross moments later. (AFP)

    Man City crisis deepens with defeat at Juventus

<img alt="Manchester City's Erling Braut Haland (right) at the end of the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783110_1_20241212072102.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were plunged further into crisis on Wednesday after falling to a 2-0 defeat at Juventus which threatens their chances of reaching the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie were enough for Juve to inflict a seventh defeat in 10 matches on Pep Guardiola's struggling City.
  <br>
  <br>
  English champions City languish in 22nd place in Europe's top club competition, having collected just eight points from their six matches in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  That leaves City just one point above the bottom 12 places and elimination, with matches against Paris Saint-Germain and Club Brugge remaining, a position that would have been unthinkable at the start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City have unravelled in less than six weeks and are way off the pace both in the Premier League and Champions League thanks to just one win, over Nottingham Forest, since the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have the Manchester derby at the weekend, hardly the sort of fixture they need in the midst of this dismal run from.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get points, we'll go to Paris to try and do that and the same goes for the final match at home," said Guardiola to Amazon Prime in Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can get out of this period by playing like we did today. We lost very few balls and I think we played very well... they deserve more because they give everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vlahovic's header, his 10th goal of the season, and substitute McKennie's fine volley with 15 minutes remaining also snapped a frustrating four-match run of draws for Juventus and brightened the mood among fans who have been disappointed with Thiago Motta's opening few months as coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve had drawn 11 of their 20 matches in all competitions coming into Wednesday's match, but a rugged display moved them up to 11 points and ended with fans roaring with joy and colouring the stands of the Allianz Stadium with flag waving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motta's team are level with fellow Serie A outfit Atalanta and two points from the top eight positions which give direct access to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was little suggestion of Juve grabbing such a big result after a very drab opening period in frigid Turin, where two off-form teams ineffectually bumped up against one another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The best chance of the half came five minutes before the break when Michele Di Gregorio did well to charge down Erling Haaland as the Norway striker tried to flick home Kevin De Bruyne's neat through ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve produced even less in front in increasingly frustrated supporters, who only had a Kenan Yildiz pot shot to shout about in a largely dismal opening period for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that all changed in the 53rd minute thanks to Vlahovic just about forcing his close-range header across the line after City goalkeeper Ederson had kept out Federico Gatti's flying volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stunned into action, City pushed for a leveller as Juve retreated into their own box, a move reminiscent of dozens of similarly dogged Italian defensive displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Di Gregorio did brilliantly to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's powerful long-range effort in the 68th minute, seconds before McKennie came on for Khephren Thuram.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American turned out to be an inspired choice as he was on hand, completely unmarked, to lash in countryman Timothy Weah's deftly clipped cross and kill off City's hopes of saving a point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a mixed session on Wednesday, with a rally in Google's parent company Alphabet spurring the tech-rich Nasdaq to end the day above 20,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slipped 0.2 percent to close at 44,148, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 6,084.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq was the day's big winner, jumping 1.8 percent to close at a new record of 20,034, after Alphabet reported it had made a breakthrough in quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent the firm's share price soaring, with its class A shares closing up 5.5 percent.

  Investors were also digesting the news that consumer inflation ticked higher last month, largely in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investors are reacting positively to the latest inflation data for two reasons," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Number one, it gives the Fed more room to continue with easy money, cutting rates," he said. "And then number two, it allows more room for the economy to grow without the threat of inflation picking up." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The father and stepmother of Sara Sharif, a 10-year-old girl who was found dead in her home in Britain, were on Wednesday convicted of her murder after a trial which heard harrowing details of her treatment before her killing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharif was found dead in August 2023 at her home in Woking, a town southwest of London, after what prosecutors say was a campaign of "serious and repeated violence".
  <br>
  <br>
  The family fled to Pakistan immediately after Sara Sharif was killed, before they were arrested in September 2023 at London's Gatwick airport after flying from Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Sara had suffered a litany of injuries, including burns, broken bones and bite marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and his wife Beinash Batool, 30, stood trial at London's Old Bailey court charged with her murder, which they denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jury convicted Sharif and Batool of Sara's murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's uncle Faisal Malik, 29, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of causing or allowing Sara's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif and Batool will be sentenced on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Urfan Sharif had called police and said: "It wasn't my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif gave evidence and initially denied responsibility for Sara's death. He accepted slapping Sara to discipline her, but denied beating her in a regular or sustained way.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sharif, under questioning from Batool's lawyer Caroline Carberry, later said he took "full responsibility" for his daughter's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Batool, who did not give evidence, said Sharif was violent and controlling and that she was scared of him. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed after a powerful blast rocked a residential high-rise building in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, mainland media reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Fire Brigade said it sent 16 fire trucks and 80 rescue personnel to the scene after receiving a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing News said a preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out on the 28th floor due to a gas explosion, with the cause of the blast still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  One person reportedly fell off the building following the blast, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said workers at the nearby 66-storey China Resources Tower said they felt tremors after the explosion. Some companies in the building evacuated their staff to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations and rescue efforts are underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police said Wednesday that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk-yeol's offices to investigate his brief imposition of martial law, with the opposition party accusing the presidential staff of illegally protecting an insurrectionist.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is already banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned South Korea's allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hours into a standoff at the presidential offices, police Wednesday evening said "The special investigation team is currently continuing to discuss the seizure and search of the presidential office (with the presidential staff and security)."
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party warned it would file legal complaints for insurrection against the presidential staff and security if they continued to obstruct law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the presidential office (staff) and the security are protecting right now is not the head of state, but an insurrectionist," said DP lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seung-lae. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has announced that Port Island will reopen on Thursday after the excavation of dinosaur fossils was completed there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 30 rocks containing dinosaur fossils have been found since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials announced that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, were discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The excavation work was led by the Antiquities and Monuments Office with help from mainland palaeontologists and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team said all exposed fossils from the site have been removed, and they will study these fossils to figure out the dinosaur species and explore Hong Kong's palaeoecology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a spokesman from the Development Bureau reminded members of the public that "the island is remote and lacks ancillary facilities for landing and sightseeing".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geographical and weather conditions that may pose risks for boat docking, members of the public are urged not to take risks to land on Port Island," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added there will be a temporary workshop at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre from December 20 for people to observe the preparation of fossil specimens.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, and the Israeli defence minister announced his country's forces had destroyed Syria’s navy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it conducted about 480 strikes over the past 48 hours on strategic military targets in Syria, days after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (army) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements," the military said in a statement, adding that the targets included 15 naval vessels, anti-aircraft batteries and weapons production sites in several cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence officials said Israeli ships struck two Syrian naval facilities during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has acknowledged pushing into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it remained unclear if Israeli soldiers had gone beyond that area, which was established more than 50 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel denied it was advancing on the Syrian capital of Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel intended to establish a demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a navy base in Haifa, Katz said the army would create a “defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence, in order to prevent terrorism in Syria from taking root.” (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The project director of Kai Tak Sports Park on Wednesday said the venue is well-positioned to showcase Hong Kong as a host city for mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony announcing an exclusive partnership with HSBC, John Sharkey also unveiled plans to build the first outdoor AirBadminton court at a mall at the sports park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharkey said major facilities at the venue will be completed by the end of this year, and test events have been progressing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that KTSB [Kai Tak Sports Park] will further leverage Hong Kong's advantages as a host city, providing more citizens with the opportunity to experience the resilience of our athletes first hand,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we will nurture the next generation's involvement in sports, allowing them to showcase their talents on an international stage that they can be proud to call their home.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, Luanne Lim, said she thinks the partnership will elevate Hong Kong's profile as a global sports hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this partnership, we want to support this active lifestyle by making recreational and sporting activities available to everyone, every day,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sports unites us and brings people together, not just locally but across borders and across cultures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim added the bank will open a new branch at the sports park to serve the local community and international visitors.

    Hard to set sexual abuse allegation time frame: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said on Wednesday that it would be rather difficult to set a time frame as to how quickly the authorities should make public allegations of sexual abuse against residents of care homes for disabled people.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a full council meeting in the legislature, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien noted that it took officials two months to announce an alleged incident earlier this year, and said he found it unacceptable that there is no set criteria for revealing such suspected incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, Sun said the circumstances of each alleged incident are always different and if a time frame is set that is too short, this might cause the mishandling of cases, adding that if the time frame was too long, people might question why the announcement did not come sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for us to set a fixed time frame for announcements, and we have to take into consideration the unique nature of every such incident," he told lawmakers during a Q&A session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do have to take care of the emotions of the victims as well as their family members, and we will try to announce such incidents as early as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials amended a code of practice for care homes for the disabled, including setting out policies on installing CCTV and reviewing the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's a social worker by trade, pointed out that while most care homes have installed surveillance cameras, they often are too understaffed to check the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Sun said there could be "riskier" periods such as when there are fewer people at the homes at weekends, and staff could review footage of those periods more regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said in the long run, officials hope artificial intelligence can help with such monitoring work.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Huangmaohai Sea-Crossing Passage, connecting Zhuhai and Jiangmen, officially opened on Wednesday, and it is expected the link will boost travel across the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  The 31-kilometre link is the western extension of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and starts in Pingsha Town while ending in Taishan City's Doushan Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project consists of two main bridges - Huangmaohai Bridge and Gaolan Port Bridge, two tunnels, four interchanges and one service area.
  <br>
  <br>
  With its commencement, the travel time between Zhuhai and Jiangmen is reduced from more than one hour to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that some drivers from different GBA cities, including Zhuhai, Jiangmen and Macau, waited to get a glimpse of the link.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction of the bridge began in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the world's longest three-tower cable-stayed highway design bridge.

<img alt="InvestHK and Deloitte say Hong Kong can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783008_1_20241211160129.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to become a green technology hub, according to a study conducted by the government’s investment promotion agency and accounting firm Deloitte.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said on Wednesday that the green technology industry is worth trillions of dollars, but 41 percent of climate problems are still waiting to be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This creates enormous business opportunities for the investors and also the tech innovators, as one way to interpret this number is that 41 percent of the problems currently do not have an available solution," said King Leung, InvestHK's Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study said the city can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors, including transport, construction and waste management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohit Grover, the lead partner for sustainability and climate at Deloitte's Hong Kong branch, said the SAR can assist Chinese electric car companies with expanding their business worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Chinese enterprises, Hong Kong will be used as one of the global hubs to globalise their operations and to raise capital through the exchange. We already see a lot of shift happening from Western brands to Chinese brands for the electric vehicles (EV) that we see on the road," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for some of the technology innovation around various aspects of battery production or EV production, I think those start-ups are also being present in Hong Kong, which will get a bigger access to the [global] market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For construction, Leung suggested the adoption of glass materials for insulation and generating solar power to lower energy consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "90 percent of all the electricity consumed in Hong Kong goes to buildings. We have 8,000 skyscrapers, which is the most in a single city in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that China is leading the world in green building technology patents, and Hong Kong's positioning as an international financial centre can help such companies to showcase their abilities and therefore expand to global markets through the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of waste management, Grover said a behavioural change among residents of Hong Kong will be crucial.

    'Mega events in first half drew HK$2.4bn in spending'

<img alt="Rosanna Law noted that RTHK has produced a programme providing updates on local mega events. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782995_1_20241211142635.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that mega events in the first half of the year had attracted an estimated 550,000 visitors, who spent around HK$2.4 billion and added about HK$1.4 billion in value to the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law said there were 110 mega events in the first six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 70 of them were conventions and exhibitions as well as cultural, arts and creative events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker, Jeffrey Lam, asked the government how it could further enhance the attractiveness of mega-events and boost their economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said one of the administration's key purposes of compiling a Hong Kong mega event calendar in advance, is to allow the public and tourists to learn about them early.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[This can] foster collaboration between different industries and mega events, and facilitate the industries of tourism, hotel and catering to plan and design promotional activities and tourism products early," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said RTHK had produced a programme called "Mega Events Mega Hong Kong", which gives daily updates on what's happening through different media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Information Services Department has used its website and social media platforms, such as Xiaohongshu, for promotion, while inviting media from the mainland and overseas to cover the city's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said with HK$100 million in this year's budget earmarked for boosting mega-event promotion over the next three years, officials will review and optimise resources to enhance publicity efforts, bearing in mind ongoing developments and mega-event planning updates.

<img alt="Jordan Tang (L) and Tse Ying-suet roared to a winning start at the World Tour Finals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

    'Passengers won't pay for transition to e-buses'

<img alt="The government says its subsidies will cover the additional costs involved as bus companies switch to electric vehicles. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782969_1_20241211114826.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Wednesday that he believes the additional costs incurred in Hong Kong's planned transition to electric buses will not be passed on to passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, the government plans to subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aim is for the SAR to achieve carbon neutrality, with all franchised buses and taxis to be zero emission vehicles by 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tse said the subsidy is sufficient to cover the extra costs that will be incurred by bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, electric double decker buses were much more expensive than regular ones, double the price of a normal bus. Regular buses cost about two million dollars, and electric ones cost four to five million dollars each. As technology advances, in recent months we have seen the price has reduced drastically. But they still cost millions of dollars each," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government will offer subsidies that cover the additional costs that are incurred from changing to electric buses. In that way, companies won't have to pass the additional costs incurred on to passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to offer 500 more high-speed charging stations for taxis by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the government will encourage petrol stations to build charging spots and offer discounts to taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, questioned whether the government will be able to achieve all these goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he made an application to install charging spots in Tsing Yi around a year ago, but this has yet to be approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You said more charging stations will be available by the end of 2027, it's so vague. Shouldn't you talk about your goal for each year? It would be better. Or you can say by which month a certain number of charging spots will be available. In this way, it's more concrete," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said he welcomes the government's plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should provide more high-speed charging spots, to benefit both the transport industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said the government should also consider promoting the use of hydrogen vehicles.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister tried to kill himself shortly before he was formally arrested over his role in this month's martial law operation, a senior prisons official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament but was forced to rescind the decree hours later after lawmakers voted it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence minister Kim Yong-hyun resigned last Thursday and was formally arrested on Tuesday on charges including "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  During a parliamentary hearing, the commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service said the former minister tried to kill himself minutes before his arrest was announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before midnight, "former Minister of Defence Kim Yong-hyun attempted suicide at the Seoul Dongbu Detention Center," said Shin Yong-hae.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding that he received the report Wednesday morning, Shin said Kim had tried to kill himself in the toilet using a string from his clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A control room staff member intervened, and when they opened the door, he immediately gave up the attempt," said Shin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shin added that Kim was now under protection in a secure cell and in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The medical examination results indicate that the inmate's health status is good without any abnormalities, and he is currently living a normal life in the facility," the justice ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had issued an apology on Tuesday, saying through his lawyers that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  He "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties". (AFP)

    Private school accused of not refunding debentures

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group of parents have accused private school Han Academy of failing to refund debentures as promised after their children left the school.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Wong Chuk Hang institution's website, parents who enrol their children from the 2020-21 academic year must join a capital contribution scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the options is a debenture of HK$600,000. HK$45,000 is deducted every year and the remaining amount can be refunded when the student leaves the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received complaints from 11 parents, involving about HK$5.8 million. The force has listed the matter as a request for police investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Education Bureau said it had instructed the school to suspend its capital contribution scheme in April and establish an emergency response plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added it had received complaints from three parents so far and had urged the school to refund the money as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement added that any individual fundraising scheme by private schools has to be vetted and approved by the bureau. So far 23 schools have made such applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Secretary for Education Christine Choi pointed out the vetting mechanism was not in place when Han Academy opened in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The school was established in 2017 and back then we didn't have the vetting mechanism. Since the mechanism was set up in August 2023, we have been reviewing its additional charges," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added the bureau has demanded the school stop collecting additional fees from parents after realising it has run into financial trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also revealed more than 100 students are currently enrolled at the academy, and the bureau will make sure it maintains its teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung said he has received feedback from more than 50 parents who allege they haven't had their money back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they are worried about the school's financial situation and that it might close down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The parents also have heard that the school's owner intends to wind up the school through legal means due to the ongoing unpaid rent... A couple of days ago the school also held a meeting with the parents and announced that they are in debt of HK$100 million," he told RTHK.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that Hong Kong will continue to make use of its strengths in the fields of aviation and cargo to contribute to the development of an international logistics hub in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at the second Business Conference on Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Development, Lee said the territory will collaborate with other cities in the region to build a comprehensive and modern transport system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will make use of Hong Kong's professional marine services, and cooperate with the mainland and Macau to increase the competitiveness of the Greater Bay Area's port clusters. As for aviation, Hong Kong is developing intermodal cargo‑transhipment with Dongguan, and we have brought forward the development of the Hong Kong International Airport Dongguan Logistics Park," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has also recently signed a shares acquisition agreement with Zhuhai Airport, which strengthens the foundation of passenger services between Beijing, Zhuhai and Hong Kong," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said the "one-hour living circle" in the Greater Bay Area has showcased the development results of the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong citizens going north to spend, and mainland citizens coming south to travel and shop has become the norm. This has enhanced exchanges among Hong Kong and the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government's earlier resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme has allowed more than ten million Shenzhen residents to enter Hong Kong freely, which further injects strong forces towards Hong Kong's tourism, retail and catering industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that his Policy Address in October included various measures to promote development in the area, including regarding the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and fostering connections in areas such as logistics and aviation qualifications.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea is in "chaos" after President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law, North Korean state media said on Wednesday in its first comments on the political upheaval.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule on Tuesday last week and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shocking incident of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing impeachment and a governance crisis, suddenly declaring a martial law decree and unhesitatingly wielding the guns and knives of its fascist dictatorship wrought chaos across South Korea," North Korean state media said in a commentary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The international community is sternly watching, with assessments that the martial law incident exposed vulnerabilities in South Korean society," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commentators described Yoon's abrupt declaration of martial law as a desperate move and that Yoon Suk Yeol's political life could face an early end."
  <br>
  <br>
  In declaring martial law on December 3, Yoon said it would safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between the two Koreas have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons since May, in what it says is retaliation for anti-Pyongyang propaganda missives sent North by activists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was arrested on Tuesday, has been accused by opposition lawmakers of calling for strikes on sites from which North Korea was launching balloons carrying trash, an order reportedly refused by his subordinates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition plans to bring another motion to impeach Yoon to a vote on Saturday. (AFP)

<img alt="Matt Coulson, executive director of Kids4Kids, says the charity will use the funds from OSC to support youths. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782953_1_20241211095458.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity dedicated to empower young people has strived to help low-resourced teenagers become better problem-solvers and be more resilient.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2008, Kids4Kids has been working with children from less advantaged backgrounds on a number of issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-profit, which is among the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), has helped more than 35,000 pupils and involved over 30,000 volunteers over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt Coulson, the organisation's executive director, said the initiative funded by the annual drive works with individuals aged between 12 and 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This particular project basically works with low-resourced kids and works on their life skills, works on their integration, works on developing their sense of well-being, their sense of importance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, Coulson said, is to encourage young people use their creativity to solve problems, be engaged with their community, and develop resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coulson said the organisation will use the funds from OSC to support youths in charting their own paths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be spending it to develop some really particular psychological support structure systems for young people, and encouraging them along the journey of entrepreneurship, to allow them to explore a future that isn't just in catering, or isn't just in food services, but it could be anything," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entrepreneurial journey we encourage the kids to go on is all around developing solutions to UNSDG (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) problems, trying to create solutions for their communities that really deeply engage in positive change making."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    Tap into the mainland database for clinical trials: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's healthcare sector needs to maximise its edge on the international stage by collaborating with its mainland counterparts in clinical trials, according to the chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spelling out his vision on RTHK programme Overview Policy, John Lee reiterated the main objective of reforming the healthcare system is to ensure efficient division of work among the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health and the Primary Healthcare Commission, which was set up in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make primary healthcare accessible for everyone in the community. People need to take good care of themselves, especially before they fall ill so they don't have to rely on treatment. The basis is to have everyone protect their own health on a day-to-day basis," Lee explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal, the chief executive stated, is to establish Hong Kong's own drug regulator and speed up registration of new pharmaceutical products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, a drug can only be submitted for approval after it has been registered in at least two reference jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the aim is to substitute part of that requirement with approved clinical trials, where collaboration with the mainland is essential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have data from 7.5 million patients. But if we can utilise the data from 1.4 billion people on the mainland, or even just 78 to 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, then the clinical trials will become a lot more effective," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader also stressed that careful planning is needed when establishing a third medical school in the city, to make sure it does not take away students or resources with the two existing institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only around 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the ratio of 2.5 in other advanced economies. There's a lot of catching up to do, and with the current limited intake quota for medical students it's very important to set up a third medical school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time I don't want these institutions to compete against each other for students. So right now the idea is to let two medical schools focus on teaching, while the third can focus on research and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee confirmed multiple universities have expressed interest to take up the initiative, and a working group is now assessing which one is the most suitable candidate and meets all of the Medical Council's requirements.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid got their European Champions League title defence back up and running after coming through a tough battle to win 3-2 at Atalanta.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were just enough for Madrid to triumph in a red-hot atmosphere in Bergamo and move up to nine points from six matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side would have been at risk of dropping out of the play-off places but came through a tough test at Serie A leaders Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The away side are now three points from the top eight positions which give direct qualification for the last 16 with two matches remaining in their league campaign and a round of fixtures coming up on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid inflicted on Atalanta a first defeat in this year's revamped competition and are now only two points behind Gian Piero Gasperini's ambitious team who performed well against 15-time European champions Madrid but now sit ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously we're a little disappointed, but we're learning so much from these matches," Gasperini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing tiny details, but we played with heart against great champions," he added. "We were defeated in result, but not in performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atalanta scored through a Charles De Ketelaere penalty which levelled Mbappé's opener in first-half stoppage time and a fine Ademola Lookman strike in the 65th minute which put the hosts back in the match after Vinicius and Bellingham's quickfire goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts even came to within inches of snatching a dramatic draw deep in added time when substitute Retegui somehow shot over Lookman's fizzing cross from from practically on the goalline. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Champions League group phase leaders Liverpool virtually sealed a place in the last 16 with a tight 1-0 victory at Girona after Mohamed Salah struck from the penalty spot.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool have made a stunning start in the competition under coach Arne Slot, winning all six of their matches to move provisionally five points clear of second-placed Inter Milan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English giants, six-time winners of the competition, were given a tough night by Champions League debutants Girona, who fell to a fifth defeat and are on the verge of elimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing in the top eight will avoid an extra round of play-off matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me about all six games, I'm really pleased with all the results – but I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight," Slot told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better but then I'm trying to be positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot started fit-again goalkeeper Alisson Becker after a two-month injury lay-off and the Brazilian showed no sign of rust on a busy night.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their Merseyside derby clash at Everton was called off because of a storm at the weekend, Slot was able to pick a fresh side, going with arguably his strongest available team to try and assure a top eight finish as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcomers Girona, who lost several key players in the summer and are still rebuilding, opted for Arnaut Danjuma in attack with support from spritely duo Bryan Gil and Yaser Asprilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool pinned the hosts back in the first 10 minutes and Girona stopper Paulo Gazzaniga pushed away a Joe Gomez header.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that Michel Sanchez's Girona found their footing on a chilly night at their sold-out Montilivi stadium, reduced to under 10,000 capacity due to UEFA regulations, and they began to put Alisson to the test. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday as markets paused from a post-election rally, while Google parent Alphabet surged on what it called a "major" technology announcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  After winning numerous records in the weeks since the November 5 presidential election, US stocks have fallen the last two days amid caution ahead of key inflation data.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Alphabet jumped 5.3 percent after Google showed off a new quantum computing chip that it described as a significant breakthrough in the field that it said could lead to advances in drug discovery, fusion energy and other areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.4 percent at 44.247.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent to 6,034, while the tech-rich Nasdaq also fell 0.3 percent to 19,687.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses come ahead of Thursday's consumer price index, which will be closely scrutinised by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance soared 17.7 percent following reports that it could be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing jumped 4.5 percent as it announced it was resuming production at two Seattle-area plants that had been shuttered for nearly three months due to a labour strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle slumped 6.7 percent after reporting lower-than-expected profits despite "extraordinary" growth in the artificial intelligence segment of the company's infrastructure business.

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday gathered leaders of all parties – except the far right and the far left – for talks about forming a government, the first time under the hung parliament left by June's election that mainstream parties had sat down together.
 <br>
  <br>
  The meeting included moderate left-wing leaders willing to compromise to break the political impasse, distancing themselves from the anti-capitalist France Unbowed, which declined to join them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Socialists are seen as likely kingmakers in Macron's bid to form a new government, with sufficient parliamentary support to make sure it survives, unlike the last cabinet under veteran conservative Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have come to say we are ready to have a left-wing prime minister, but one who is open to compromise," Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told reporters on his way into the Winter Garden of the president's Elysee Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists, while sticking to their calls for a new prime minister to hail from the left, have shifted since Barnier's government was toppled in a vote of no-confidence last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, they no longer insist on Macron naming a prime minister whom France Unbowed would approve of, saying France cannot remain rudderless.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source in Macron's entourage declined to say whether he would indeed name a prime minister from the left, but did say entrenched positions had begun to shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists say Macron's decision not to invite Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) opens space for cooperation. But Green leader Marine Tondelier said the president would also have to compromise, adding "We've come to hear what concessions Macron is willing to make".
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen said she had not wanted an invitation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president knows that, so he didn't invite the RN to the party where the jobs will be divided up." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said it is time to promote the use of electric vehicles, given the drop in prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, Tse said the government will subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis, with invitation letters to be sent to those eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said he believes the incentives will be sufficient to attract operators to opt for electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the prices are coming down very quickly, I believe very soon, electric vehicles will be very competitive against the conventional vehicles. And therefore, the need for further subsidies in future, I believe, will diminish,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To achieve the aim of all franchised buses and taxis being zero emission vehicles by 2050, the minister said the authorities will review the process in 2027 and then every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus welcomed the government's plan and said it would buy 200 electric buses under the subsidy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator also said it would continue to expand its use of hydrogen buses, and stressed it was committed to achieving zero emission operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB, meanwhile, said it currently has more than 80 electric buses, and would consider buying more of them.

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who are deemed to have "behaved poorly" on Hong Kong-related issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington had grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously violated principles of international law and basic norms of international relations by imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who have behaved poorly on Hong Kong-related issues. We must emphasise that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. We urge the US side to genuinely respect China's sovereignty, Hong Kong's rule of law, and cease any form of interference in Hong Kong affairs," Mao said at a news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington had last month said it would impose fresh sanctions on Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the SAR's national security law following the jailing of 45 people for subversion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive-care unit after undergoing surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, the Sirio-Libanes Hospital said in a statement on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leader felt headaches doctors believed resulted from a fall at home in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital said Lula, who travelled from the capital Brasilia to be treated 1,000 kilometers south in Sao Paulo, is “well, under monitoring in an ICU bed” after the bleeding was drained.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors later said he was "stable" and should leave hospital next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a Brics summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in court in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to testify for the first time in his corruption case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu, who has repeatedly sought to delay his appearance in court, is the first sitting prime minister of Israel to face a criminal trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust in three separate cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several people, including anti-Netanyahu protesters and his supporters, gathered outside the court, while some right-wing lawmakers attended the session, which was held in an underground chamber for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he physically appeared in court was in June 2023, before the war in Gaza began in October that year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down 0.5 percent at 20,311.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.6 percent at 3,422, while the Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.8 percent higher at 10,812.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Yeung, the chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy on Monday has sent a positive signal to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the market has been excited in the last 24 hours after the Politburo statement. But obviously, it's just a change of wording that creates a lot of imagination," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It basically implies that the central bank is willing to cut the interest rate more and to inject liquidity... From now towards the National People's Congress [meeting], the market will be expecting more consumption support in almost every holiday season."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said careful timing and execution are important given the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday rolled out a roadmap for Hong Kong to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with international standards.
 <br>
  <br>
  It says publicly accountable entities, including banks, security brokers and all regulated financial institutions, are required to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants will release local standards that align with ISSB Standards by the end of this year, with an effective date of August 1 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from January 1, 2025 major listed companies will be required to adopt a “comply or explain” approach for their disclosures related to the climate requirements in the ISSB Standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those listed in the Hang Seng Composite LargeCap Index will also have to disclose their compliance with climate requirements from January 1, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed publicly accountable entities with an expected effective date of January 1, 2028, under a proportionate approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, certain non-listed financial institutions that carry significant weight will also need to adopt local standards no later than 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR is taking consistent steps to boost its competitiveness as a premier financial centre through observing international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, he added that the roadmap’s launch highlights the government's dedication to promoting green and sustainable financing and investment, while also laying out a clear framework on sustainability reporting for financial institutions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will travel to Beijing for his annual duty visit on Wednesday to meet senior officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will make a four-day visit to the capital to "brief state leaders on the latest economic, social and political situation in Hong Kong", a government statement said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining him on the trip are the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Carol Yip, and his private secretary Vicki Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Financial Secretary Paul Chan will take turns acting in the chief executive's position over the four-day period ending Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of the duty visit, a question and answer session with the chief executive and lawmakers in the legislature scheduled for Thursday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will be notified by the secretariat when the session is rescheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Lee announced he would hold a Q&A session in Legco, with topics such as economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network to be included in the discussion.

  A day after Yoon himself was hit with a travel ban, his party was forging a "resignation roadmap" that reportedly could see him step down in February or March before fresh elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are probing the president and a cabal of allies -- many from the same school -- for alleged insurrection over the sequence of extraordinary events.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, and two other top police officials became the latest to be banned from foreign travel, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already confined to South Korean territory are the former defence and interior ministers, martial law commander General Park An-su and defence counterintelligence commander Yeo In-hyung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, was detained on Sunday and late on Monday prosecutors filed a formal arrest warrant against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges included "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court will hold a hearing later on Tuesday to rule on whether to issue the warrant for Kim, the first court decision to be made related to the martial law chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim issued contrite comments Tuesday saying that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties", in a statement made through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon narrowly survived an impeachment effort in parliament on Saturday as tens of thousands braved freezing temperatures to call for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups held further candlelight vigils across the country on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed after members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP) walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP says that in exchange Yoon has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting the opposition to accuse it of a "second coup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported on Tuesday that the PPP will announce a "resignation road map" soon in order to head off a new impeachment motion, which the opposition wants to put before lawmakers on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party's task force was also reportedly reviewing two options, including for Yoon to resign in February with an April election, or to step down in March with a vote in May. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

    Nearly 200 dead in Haiti massacre

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people in Haiti were killed in brutal weekend violence reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners, with the government on Monday condemning a massacre of "unbearable cruelty".
 <br>
  <br>
  The killings in the capital Port-au-Prince were overseen by a powerful gang leader convinced that his son's illness was caused by followers of the religion, according to civil organisation the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest act of extreme violence by powerful gangs that control most of the capital city in the Caribbean country mired for decades in political instability, natural disasters and other woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son," a statement from the Haiti-based group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "horrific" violence, which his spokesman said left at least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the bloody episode an "act of barbarity, of unbearable cruelty," the office of Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime said "this monstrous crime constitutes a direct attack on humanity".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the CPD and UN said that the killings took place in the capital's western coastal neighborhood of Cite Soleil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed," the CPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiti has suffered from decades of instability but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-prime minister Ariel Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs now control 80 percent of the city. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong on Tuesday said 10-minute limits placed on visits to the giant pandas An An and Ke Ke helped prevent overcrowding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people flocked to the park when the pandas made their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd control measures were taken after considering the visitor experience and safety concerns. They're necessary because the exhibit can't hold too many people," Pong said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With regard to the 10-minute visiting time, we looked at other places and this isn't too short. Some places only allow visitors to stay for three or four minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong also said the public were able to meet the pandas sooner than originally expected, as the animals were adopting very well to their new habitat and are very energetic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that twin panda cubs at the park are in good shape, with the heavier male starting to develop its baby teeth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair could be able to meet the public from around Lunar New Year, Pong said.

    West Ham beat Wolves to ease pressure on Lopetegui

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jarrod Bowen eased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui as his superb strike sealed a vital 2-1 win that pushed Wolves manager Gary O'Neil closer to the sack on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a showdown dubbed "El Sackico" due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the futures of Lopetegui and O'Neil, it was the Hammers chief who earned some much-needed breathing space thanks to Bowen's moment of magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowen bagged a priceless winner in the second half at the London Stadium, just moments after Wolves defender Matt Doherty had cancelled out Tomas Soucek's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham's first win in three games lifted them nine points clear of the relegation zone, while second bottom Wolves remain four points adrift of safety after their 10th defeat in 15 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the aftermath of last week's 3-1 loss at Leicester, Lopetegui was reported to have survived a board meeting about his position.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes in the close-season, must build on this valuable victory over the team he managed in the 2022-23 season before he can fully relax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't talk about noise, I talk about football. If you ask me about football, I will. A win is always good for me," Lopetegui said. "The fans have supported us a lot through the bad times. I'm happy for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil, who played for West Ham from 2011 to 2013, heard Wolves fans call for his dismissal during their 4-0 thrashing at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he will anxiously await the verdict from the Wolves board on his future, which looks bleak after the latest blow to Wolves' survival hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An awful lot of decisions went against us in a big game, big moments. You need some of them to go your way but they didn't," O'Neil said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not concerned," he added. "People above me are supportive, but the supporters want to be successful – I understand I have to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were rocked at the weekend by the news that their Jamaica striker Michail Antonio had been in a serious car crash that left him needing surgery on a lower limb fracture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old had to be cut out of his Ferrari following the accident, with Lopetegui admitting it was a "miracle" he survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't an easy week. We dedicate the victory to Michail," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hammers fans held a minute's applause for Antonio in the ninth minute to match his shirt number. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men's football team will kick off the final round of their campaign for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup when they travel to Singapore in March following Monday’s draw for qualification to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR were drawn in Group C, which also features India and Bangladesh. Only the winners from each of the six groups earn a spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will begin their qualifying campaign by playing Singapore away on March 25, and India on June 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  These qualifiers will be the final chance for 24 teams to secure the final six spots, with the SAR being drawn in a tight and extremely competitive group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore are currently ranked 161 in the world, and are also gearing up to take on Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste in the Asean Championships being played across Southeast Asia this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, India – who qualified for the 2023 edition of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar but finished bottom of their group – are ranked 127th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh, ranked 185th, has also shown rapid improvement in their level of play in recent times.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.

    Suspect in US insurance exec killing in custody: NYPD

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt on Monday evening and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" – language used by insurers to reject claims – were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset", New York police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America". (AFP)

<img alt="Neuer during Bayern Munich's German Cup match against Bayer Leverkusen. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782800_1_20241210090342.jpg&q=85">

 Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer will likely not play again in 2024, coach Vincent Kompany said ahead of Tuesday's clash with Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He's got a broken rib, which means he probably won't play again this year," Kompany said. "What's important is that it heals now – hopefully from the start of January we'll have him back, but for now it's too early."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kompany confirmed Neuer broke his rib in a collision with Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong on Tuesday, for which the goalie also picked up the first red card of his 866-game career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are missing several first-team players as an injury crisis sweeps through the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman, Alphonso Davies, Joao Palhinha, Serge Gnabry, Josip Stanisic, Hiroki Ito and Mathys Tel are all on the injured list, while back-up 'keeper Sven Ulreich is out for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing a lot of players, but I think we've come through well so far," Kompany said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's absence means Bayern's third-choice goalie, Daniel Peretz, will start between the sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israel goalkeeper will play his third game for Bayern having made his club debut off the bench after Neuer's sending off in the 1-0 German Cup last 16 loss to Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-time Champions League winners sit in 13th spot on the Champions League table after five matches, after three home wins and away losses to Barcelona and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Shakhtar would help Bayern's bid to finish in the top eight and avoid an additional playoff round. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street finished lower, as Nvidia led the tech sector lower, and investors are also nervous ahead of inflation data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782786_1_20241210052146.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The main US indices finished lower on Monday, fueled by a decline in AI leader Nvidia that weighed on tech stocks, as investors looked ahead to a crucial inflation report set for later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell after China's market regulator launched an investigation into the chipmaker over suspected violation of antimonopoly law, dragging down the information technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Advanced Micro Devices slipped after BofA Global Research downgraded its rating on the stock, weighing on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market was taken a bit by surprise regarding China's investigating (Nvidia) as a possible antimonopoly-law violation. So that's one thing that's putting a little damper on the market," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 37.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 6,052.35, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 123.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,736.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to 44,401.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast declined after forecasting a loss of more than 100,000 broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, denting the communication services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Hershey soared following a report that Cadbury parent Mondelez was exploring an acquisition of the chocolate maker. Mondelez shares fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are anticipating the consumer price index (CPI) data set for release on Wednesday, along with the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, emphasized caution regarding the central bank's approach to easing monetary policy due to the economy's resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes started December on a positive note, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both gaining in their first week, while the blue-chip Dow ended the week slightly lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks soared in November after Donald Trump won the presidential election and his party secured control of both houses of Congress, raising expectations for a more business-friendly policy agenda. (Reuters)

    2024 the hottest year on record: EU monitor

<div class="itemFullText">
 This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a US$300 billion deal to tackle climate change, a package that poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still in near-record high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850. (Reuters)
