<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far-right party chief Jordan Bardella called on the French to rally this weekend to protest against a ruling that banned Marine Le Pen from running for public office for five years after being found guilty of embezzling European Union funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monday's ruling was a catastrophic setback for Le Pen, the long-time National Rally (RN) leader, who had been the front-runner in opinion polls for the 2027 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe today that the French must be outraged, and I tell them: Be outraged!," Bardella told Europe 1 radio and CNews TV over a ruling that far-right leaders said was biased and undemocratic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll take to the streets this weekend. We're organising leaflet distributions, democratic, peaceful, calm mobilisations," he said, without giving details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bardella could become the RN's de facto candidate for the 2027 election. But Le Pen suggested she was not yet ready to hand him the baton, saying on Monday: "I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this." Bardella backed her on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she would appeal as soon as possible against what she described as a politicised ruling aimed at blocking her presidential bid. Le Pen has run three times for president and had said 2027 would be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge in the court hearing on Monday, Benedicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros ($4.3 million) of EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of remorse by Le Pen and other defendants was among reasons that prompted the court to ban them from running for office with immediate effect, de Perthuis said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was given a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years to be served under home detention - and a 100,000-euro ($108,200) fine, but they will not apply until her appeals are exhausted. Appeals in France can take months or even years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants were not accused of pocketing the money but rather of using it illegally to pay the party's staff back home instead of EU parliamentary assistants. They denied wrongdoing and said the money was used legitimately.
  <br>
  <br>
  OPINION POLL
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite outrage over the ruling among the far right in France, Europe and beyond who were joined in their condemnation of what they called judicial overreach, an opinion poll showed a majority of French people agreed with the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians, including former Socialist President Francois Hollande, said it was important to respect the independence of the judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-seven percent of those interviewed by Elabe pollsters said the ruling was normal considering what Le Pen was accused of, while 42% considered it was politically biased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The poll, carried out for BFM TV, also showed that 42% of voters were happy with the ruling, with 29% unhappy - while 29% did not care.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and his minority, centre-right government were yet to react officially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the ruling, mainstream politicians including Prime Minister Francois Bayrou had said they were ill at ease with the idea that any ban on Le Pen could be enforced immediately and stop her from running in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the streets of Paris, and in Le Pen's stronghold of Henin-Beaumont, in northern France, reactions were mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a shame, it's a shame because we needed a different president, we needed the RN to win," 56-year-old resident Pascal Walkowiak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, 60-year-old Isabelle, said: "Too bad for her. I think it's a good thing because she made mistakes. And well, there you go, she can't represent us, actually." (Reuters)

    Ng On-yee happy that billiards keep Tier A status

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker star Ng On-yee said a decision last week allowing billiards to retain its Tier A status will help the players as well as the sport's overall development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR snooker queen returned to Hong Kong on Tuesday after defending her title at the British Open in Walsall, England with a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ng said maintaining billiards' Tier A status not only provides important recognition for athletes, but also allows coaches to develop better training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two key factors allowed me to play more freely in this tournament – first, having already secured my World Snooker Tour qualification early, and second, knowing that snooker would maintain its status at the Sports Institute. These significantly reduced my pressure," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the move will give more confidence to young athletes developing their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also spoke about getting into the right frame of mind in the British Open final when her opponent rallied from a 3-0 deficit to force a decisive seventh and final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was leading 3-0, I started thinking just one more frame to win, and that's when I got a bit tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After being pulled back to 3-3, I told myself to stop over-thinking – just treat it like the first frame again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Focus on taking every chance that comes, forget what's happened before, and concentrate completely on the current frame."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng will next play in the World Women’s Snooker Championship 2025 in Dongguan between May 20 and 27.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested two people after busting a cannabis production facility in Ta Kwu Ling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cannabis plants and buds worth HK$5 million were seized in a raid on Monday at a three-storey house in Ping Yeung village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they found the cannabis spread across five rooms on the first and second floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we also found that each room was installed with equipment which enhanced the cultivation of cannabis. These included powerful sun lamps, light-blocking cloths, insulation cotton and fertilisers," said inspector Ng Ka-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the plants were able to produce up to 90kg of cannabis buds per year, with a street value of HK$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 43-year-old woman was detained at the scene on suspicion of cultivating cannabis plants and trafficking in dangerous drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 42-year-old man was arrested in Yuen Long the same day on the same charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair are due to appear before a magistrate in Fanling on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The English Schools Foundation (ESF) announced on Tuesday it will raise tuition fees by an average of 4.8 percent in the coming academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Parents will have to pay about HK$650 to HK$750 more per month, depending on the grade their children are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The international school group said the increase is linked to continued uncertainty in Hong Kong economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We know that the Hong Kong economy, like that of the world more generally, continues to face uncertainties,” ESF's chief executive Belinda Greer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We honour that trust by controlling our costs and making sure that every dollar, every cent is spent for the benefit of our students and their futures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the group has taken into consideration the question of affordability while making sure that teaching quality won’t be affected.

    Xiaomi hands over data in fatal SU7 crash in Anhui

<img alt="Xiaomi' SU7 has outsold Tesla's Model 3. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798464_1_20250401165627.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xiaomi said on Tuesday that it was actively cooperating with police after a fatal accident involving a SU7 electric vehicle on Saturday and that it had handed over driving and system data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident marks the first major accident involving the SU7 sedan, which Xiaomi launched last March and since December has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi's shares, which had risen by 34.8 percent year to date, closed down 5.5 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Tech index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not disclose the number of casualties but said initial information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at 116kmh.
  <br>
  <br>
  A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down but then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97kmh, Xiaomi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident in Tongling in eastern Anhui province killed the driver and two passengers, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday citing friends of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rundown of the data submitted to local police posted on a Weibo account of the company, Xiaomi said NOA issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead and its subsequent immediate takeover only happened seconds before the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that the car caught fire after the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not mention the fire in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has two versions of smart driving systems on its SU7 EVs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The higher-end LiDAR-mounted version, as opposed to the pure vision version, enables urban navigation features such as collision avoidance and special vehicle recognition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi said the car involved in the accident was a standard version of the SU7, which has the less-advanced smart driving technology without LiDAR. (Reuters)

<img alt="Alice Mak described the current district councils as having unprecedented transparency. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798466_1_20250401165907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home affairs minister Alice Mak said on Tuesday that the number of cases a district councillor handles in a year may not fully reflect the actual work done.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a year after councillors took office following revamped district-level polls, their first annual work reports were recently made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked why some of them handled more than a thousand cases and some little more than a hundred, Mak said circumstances can vary and some cases could be more complicated than others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the authorities also introduced a new scheme where councillors have to meet the public regularly, for the people to file complaints or seek help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said some residents have complained that the sessions, held at community centres, were rather inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said officials have made changes to the scheme in a couple of districts, and they will try to adopt such changes in more communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can make things more convenient....The people said 'Of course I won't go there, I'd rather find the councillor in his or her office near my home'," she told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we're trying to improve this by asking councillors to take turns in setting up street booths as 'mobile reception rooms', so the public can contact them easier."
  <br>
  <br>
  Various local media reports have noted that the public and the press could only check the work reports in a district council office and not online, and they couldn't take pictures of the reports, including documents on expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak stressed that the arrangements follow established practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the current-term councils as having unprecedented transparency, saying there have never been so many systemic statistics available regarding the work of district councillors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Aid groups in the worst-hit areas of Myanmar said there was an urgent need for shelter, food and water after an earthquake that killed more than 2,700 people, but said the country's civil war could prevent help reaching those in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death toll had reached 2,719 and is expected to rise to more than 3,000, Myanmar's military leader Min Aung Hlaing said in a televised address on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,521 people were injured, and 441 were missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7 magnitude quake, which hit around lunchtime on Friday, was the strongest to hit the Southeast Asian country in more than a century, toppling ancient pagodas and modern buildings alike.

  <br>
  In neighbouring Thailand, rescuers pressed on with searching for life in the rubble of a collapsed skyscraper in Bangkok, but acknowledged time was against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's Mandalay area, 50 children and two teachers were killed when their preschool collapsed, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the hardest-hit areas ...communities struggle to meet their basic needs, such as access to clean water and sanitation, while emergency teams work tirelessly to locate survivors and provide life-saving aid," the UN body said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Rescue Committee said shelter, food, water and medical help were all needed in places such as Mandalay, near the epicentre of the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having lived through the terror of the earthquake, people now fear aftershocks and are sleeping outside on roads or in open fields," an IRC worker in Mandalay said in a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The civil war in Myanmar, where the junta seized power in a coup in 2021, has complicated efforts to reach those injured and made homeless by the Southeast Asian nation's biggest quake in a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amnesty International said the junta needed to allow aid to reach areas of the country not under its control. Rebel groups say the junta has conducted airstrikes after the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Myanmar's military has a longstanding practice of denying aid to areas where groups who resist it are active," Amnesty's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It must immediately allow unimpeded access to all humanitarian organisations and remove administrative barriers delaying needs assessments."
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta's tight control over communication networks and the damage to roads, bridges and other infrastructure caused by the quakes have intensified the challenges for aid workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said a meeting of regional leaders in Bangkok this week would go ahead as planned, although the junta's Min Aung Hlaing may attend by teleconference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the quake struck, sources said the junta chief had been expected to make a rare foreign trip to attend the summit in Bangkok on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw, rescue workers saved a 63-year-old woman from the rubble of a building on Tuesday, but hope was fading of finding many more survivors of the violent earthquake, compounding a humanitarian crisis caused by a bloody civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Myanmar fire department in the Naypyitaw said the woman was successfully pulled from the rubble early on Tuesday, 91 hours after being buried when the building collapsed in the 7.7 magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake's epicenter was near the country's second-largest city Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those figures are widely expected to rise, but the earthquake hit a wide swath of the country, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, leaving the full extent of the devastation hard to assess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the reports so far have come from Mandalay and Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization said overall, more than 10,000 buildings are known to have collapsed or been severely damaged in central and northwest Myanmar. (Reuters/AP)

    Three killed in Beirut as Israel targets top militant

<img alt="The airstrike targeted a Hezbollah militant in the top three floors of a building in south Beirut. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798455_1_20250401160916.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three people were killed and seven wounded in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs on Tuesday, the Lebanese health ministry said, further testing a shaky four-month ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that it attacked a Hezbollah militant "who had recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack took place a few days after a previous strike by Israel on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, a Hezbollah stronghold known as the Dahiyeh.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate statement from Hezbollah on the identity of the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the latest Israeli airstrike, calling it a "dangerous warning" that signals premeditated intentions against Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aoun said Israel's growing "aggression" requires Lebanon to intensify diplomatic outreach and mobilise international allies in support of the country's full sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam also condemned the Israeli strike and said it was a flagrant breach of UN Resolution 1701 and the ceasefire arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaf said that he has been closely monitoring the aftermath of the strike in coordination with the ministers of defence and interior.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike appeared to have damaged the upper three floors of a building in Beirut's southern suburbs, with the balconies of those floors blown out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The glass on the floors below was intact, indicating a targeted strike. Ambulances were at the scene to recover casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no evacuation warning issued for the area ahead of the strike, and families fled in the aftermath to other parts of Beirut, according to witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  November's ceasefire agreement halted the year-long conflict and mandated that southern Lebanon be free of Hezbollah fighters and weapons, that Lebanese troops deploy to the area and that Israeli ground troops withdraw from the zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But each side accuses the other of not entirely living up to those terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-brokered truce has looked increasingly flimsy lately. Israel delayed a promised troop withdrawal in January and said that it had intercepted rockets fired from Lebanon in March, which led it to bombard targets in Beirut's southern suburbs and southern Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iran-aligned Hezbollah has denied any involvement in the rocket firings. (Reuters)

    DSE exams get underway

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's university entrance exams began on Tuesday, with some candidates arriving early to avoid potential issues with the electronic check-in system.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 students registered for the first written exam in visual arts at venues across the city. They needed to use the "Check-in Smart" app before taking the exams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, there were technical glitches with both the "Check-in Smart" app and "i-Invigilation". Exam officials have since dropped the app for invigilators.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an exam venue in Kwun Tong, candidates arrived up to an hour before the scheduled start time, carrying art supplies and drawing boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Check-in Smart app] wasn't successful last year. But we rehearsed at school so it's okay. Having the admission form is fine anyway. If something goes wrong for one person, it affects everyone, so it's not a big deal," one student said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Examinations and Assessment Authority rolled out an updated version of the app following last year's technical failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 55,000 students have registered for the DSE exams this year, a 10 percent increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm nervous and couldn't eat breakfast. I haven't been sleeping well. After all, it's the first day of exams," said one student.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core subjects including Chinese, English, mathematics, and citizenship and social development will start from Wednesday.

    Australia hit by floods in inland area size of France

<img alt="A homestead is inundated by floodwaters near the town of Jundah in south-west Queensland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798443_1_20250401145343.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whole herds of cattle have drowned in vast inland floods sweeping across the Australian outback, officials said on Tuesday, as the muddy tide drenched an area the size of France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swollen rivers burst their banks after unusually heavy downpours last week over outback Queensland, an arid region home to some of the country's largest cattle ranches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said more than 100,000 livestock – cattle, sheep, goats and horses – had been swept away, were missing, or had drowned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are only early indications of the magnitude of this disaster and while these preliminary numbers are shocking, we are expecting them to continue to climb as flood waters recede," said state agriculture minister Tony Perrett.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's heartbreaking to consider what western Queenslanders will be going through over the weeks and months as they discover the full extent of losses and damage – and start the long slog to start again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flood waters stretched some 500,000 square kilometres across sparsely populated western Queensland, Perrett said, a landmass roughly equivalent to France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry body AgForce told local media some cattle ranches may have lost almost 100 percent of their herd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government Bureau of Meteorology said some towns had recorded as much as 500 millimetres of rain in the space of a week – their typical yearly total.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, more rainfall is on the way," forecaster Dean Narramore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason why we are so concerned about that is because we have numerous flood warnings current for much of Queensland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muddy livestock survived by crowding together on the few small hills cresting above the flood waters, photos posted to social media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland's fire department used helicopters to drop bales of fodder near surviving animals cut off from food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's primary industries department said some 4,000 kilometres of road had been flooded – a distance greater than the famed Route 66 connecting Chicago to Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rising waters on Tuesday morning encircled the remote outpost of Thargomindah, which describes itself as Australia's farthest town from the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A makeshift dirt flood levy was dug around the town to protect its 200 residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preparations are well under way, including securing food deliveries, ensuring the airport has enough aircraft fuel and if need be an evacuation point and accommodation," the shire council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our shire's isolated properties are stocked with food and supplies and doing okay under the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's so-called "channel country" is one of the nation's biggest cattle fattening grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the time its sweeping plains are dry and inhospitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  But cattle gorge themselves on the pastures that sprout whenever wet season rains fill the dry creek beds – or channels – that snake through the region. (AFP)

<img alt="At the CinemaCon in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas are, from left, Sam Mendes, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan and Harris Dickinson. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798436_1_20250401134811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Mendes will release four movies about The Beatles in the same month, the director has announced, with Paul Mescal playing Paul McCartney and Harris Dickinson portraying John Lennon in "the first bingeable theatrical experience."
 <br>
  <br>
  The "four-film cinematic event," hitting theaters in April 2028, will each focus on a different member of the legendary British pop quartet, with Barry Keoghan playing Ringo Starr and Joseph Quinn as George Harrison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys," Mendes told the CinemaCon movie theater convention in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intersect in different ways – sometimes overlapping, sometimes not.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're four very different human beings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming is about to begin, and is expected to take more than a year, said Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact order in which the movies will be released has not yet been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd been trying to make a film about the Beatles for years, but I had temporarily given up," explained "American Beauty" Oscar-winner Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came at the start of the CinemaCon trade convention, where movie theater owners gather annually in Las Vegas to hear Hollywood studios' plans for the coming months and years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While 2025 had been widely touted as the year that the movie industry would bounce back, the box office has so far endured a terrible start, reeling from high-profile flops like Disney's live-action "Snow White" and sci-fi "Mickey 17."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$1.3 billion taken in North America receipts so far is seven percent below an already lean first quarter of last year, which was itself derailed by the previous year's massive Hollywood strikes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local political groups have denounced Washington's move to put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the DAB on Tuesday staged a protest outside the US consulate in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party’s vice-chairman Holden Chow, who was among the demonstrators, called the sanctions an "ill-intentioned" move to suppress China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The US government has spread a lot of falsehoods against the Hong Kong government and our judiciary too, especially over the verdicts for those criminals who are found guilty in court because of national security cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's sort of a political move with the aim of suppressing China.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner’s Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong earlier said China will take strong and resolute countermeasures in response to the wrong moves by the US side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said this may include counter-sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And I'm sure that when they carry out the counter sanctions or other measures to counter the US ill-intentioned move, they will be effective,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance also strongly condemned the sanctions and urged Washington to stop meddling in China's internal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, it accused the Trump administration of ignoring the fact that Hong Kong has maintained a stable business environment for global investors, including American businesses, since the city’s national security law was put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the business community and all sectors of society to stand united, support the governance of the SAR and safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also triggered strong words from the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU).
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU said Washington's "shameless act" will be spurned by people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president Stanley Ng said the US is simply shooting itself in the foot with the sanctions.

    Over 100 injured in Kuala Lumpur gas pipeline fireball

<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive fire caused by a gas pipeline leak forced people from their homes and injured more than 100 during Eid celebrations near Malaysia's capital on Tuesday, fire officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inferno, which was visible kilometres away, was caused by "a gas pipeline leak stretching approximately 500 metres," said fire officials in Selangor state near Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  The valve to the affected pipeline belonging to Malaysia's state-run oil firm Petronas has been shut off, the fire officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the early morning blaze was coming under control in the afternoon, more than 100 people were injured, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 of the injured were hospitalised, Selangor deputy police chief Mohamad Zaini Abu Hassan was quoted as saying by local broadcaster Astro Awani.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths were reported but about 50 houses were affected by the blaze, the fire department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents were enjoying a public holiday for Eid celebrations in Muslim-majority Malaysia when they were forced to flee the suburban area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nizam Mohamad Asnizam, 49, who lives 100 metres from the site of the fire, fled from his house with his family in his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I woke up, I saw the fire raging, with an extraordinary sound. I have never experienced a fire with this kind of sound. The sound was terrifying. It felt like a jet engine was next to me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stepping on the floor was like stepping on a hot wok. The heat was like putting your head in an oven, it felt like I was burning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage shared online showed a column of fire from what appears to be an explosion, creating a massive fireball that shot into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another video shared online showed a residential area covered in smoke while a huge fire blazed in the background. Singed trees and melted cars are also seen in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selangor Chief Minister Amirudin Shari said in a Facebook post that a temporary relief centre had been set up at a nearby mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned the public to stay away from the area affected by the fire while investigations and rescue work were being carried out. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed sanctions imposed by the United States "had no impact on him" and didn't affect his work and life, saying the best way to respond is to "remain calm and collected."
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam, along with five other mainland and Hong Kong officials, were the latest to be placed on Washington's sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, he said the grounds for imposing sanctions are "completely untenable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also called Washington's move a blatant act of hegemony and bullying that was an attempt to deter those involved in safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  To respond, he said, one should safeguard national security and interests, as well as Hong Kong's stability and prosperity more resolutely.

    'Schools welcome proposed NET scheme changes'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A school representative said on Tuesday that proposed changes to the Native-speaking English Teacher (NET) scheme gives headteachers more flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  From the next academic year, schools could be able to either keep their existing NET, or opt for a grant from the Education Bureau to employ at least one NET and native-English-speaking teaching assistants or related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Primary schools can get HK$900,000 for one year, while secondary schools will receive up to HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HK$900,000 divided by 12 months, that would be around HK$70,000 a month. That would be enough to hire teachers with no teaching experience, and there would be [money] remaining for schools to hire teaching assistants or get other education services," Cheung Chok-fong, who chairs the Subsidised Primary School Council, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This allows schools to choose whether to keep their own NET, or get the cash funding from the bureau. Schools can then make more flexible arrangements," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said she hoped the bureau will also look into streamlining applications for subsidies, such as housing allowances, to reduce administration work within schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Tang Fei expressed concern that proposed stricter requirements for future NETs would reduce the number of applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are suggesting that such teachers be required to hold a bachelor's degree majoring in English, a postgraduate teaching qualification and a certificate in teaching English as a second or foreign language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, applicants only need a degree in any subject and the teaching English certificate.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Veteran Al Horford turned back the clock to help the NBA champion Boston Celtics notch a ninth straight victory and nab a franchise first with a 117-103 win over the Grizzlies in Memphis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Horford, 38, led the Celtics scoring with 26 points off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum added 25 points and 14 rebounds and the Celtics defense stymied the Grizzlies in the second half to complete a perfect 6-0 road trip – the longest unbeaten road swing in the club's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, second in the Eastern Conference behind the Cleveland Cavaliers, won all six games by double digits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Horford scored his season-high, draining six of Boston's 21 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a lot of fun," Horford said. "It's pretty amazing for me to be in this position and I'm just trying to have fun with it and enjoy with my team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant scored 26 points for the Grizzlies, who led by as many as 11 in the first half and regained the lead early in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, however, they couldn't keep pace and lost ground in their fight with the Los Angeles Lakers for fourth place in the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oklahoma City Thunder, already assured of the Western Conference top seed, racked up their 10th straight victory with a 145-117 pounding of the Chicago Bulls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Isaiah Joe came off the bench to score 31 points – leading seven Thunder players to score in double figures as Oklahoma City improved to 28-1 against Eastern Conference opponents – the NBA record for most wins by a team against an opposing conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have the same goal in mind," said Joe, who made eight of the Thunder's 23 three-pointers. "We know what we want to do at the end of the day and we know how to get there. We've just got to keep stacking days, stacking games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers rallied from 16 points down in the third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-109 and maintain their grip on fourth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 18 points and handed out 11 assists, drilling a three-pointer with just over one minute remaining that gave Indiana the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers, eighth in West but locked in a battle with Golden State and Minnesota for sixth place and direct entry to the playoffs, clawed out a gritty 96-87 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 21 points each and Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 20 rebounds – including nine on the offensive end – to help the Clippers finally seize control in a game that featured 15 lead changes in the first three quarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolo Banchero scored 26 points and Franz Wagner added 21 for the Magic, who remained in eighth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the each conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Miami Heat climbed to ninth – ahead of the Bulls – with a fifth straight victory, beating the Wizards 120-94 in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Tyler Herro added 27 points for the Heat, whose current winning streak comes on the heels of a 10-game skid. (AFP)

    Top court overturns ex-lawmaker's acquittal

<img alt="In a 3-2 ruling, the Court of Final Appeal overturns former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting's acquittal. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798417_1_20250401121740.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has overturned the acquittal of a former lawmaker for revealing that a police officer who was on duty during clashes in Yuen Long amid the 2019 protests was facing an anti-graft probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruling in favour of the government, the Court of Final Appeal restored Lam Cheuk-ting's conviction and sentence on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the former lawmaker was sentenced to four months in prison for disclosing an inquiry by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into misconduct allegations against a police officer, Yau Nai-keung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A High Court judge later quashed Lam's conviction on three counts of disclosing probe details under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Department of Justice was granted permission to take the appeal against the former lawmaker's acquittal to the top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal's ruling centred on two possible interpretations of a section under the ordinance, which stipulates protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance bans anyone with knowledge of an ongoing corruption investigation from disclosing the identity of the person involved, or the fact that the individual is subject to a probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  One interpretation, the bench said, adopted "a literal approach" that confined protections against the disclosure of bribery and corruption probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other, which read the ordinance contextually and purposively, required "nothing more than the disclosure of the existence of an investigation that is underway".
  <br>
  <br>
  The court's decision was split three against two, with the majority – Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, Justice Roberto Ribeiro and non-permanent judge James Allsop – ruling that Lam's disclosure of a misconduct probe fell within the scope of the anti-graft ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their Lordships preferred the second construction as it better reflected the statutory intent to preserve the efficacy or integrity of ICAC investigations into corruption offences and to protect the reputation of subject persons," the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such an interpretation was preferable because "either the disclosure of fact or details may prejudice the investigation," Ribeiro wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing his fellow judge, Cheung said simply revealing the fact that an individual was under investigation would amount to a prohibited disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges Joseph Fok and Johnson Lam disagreed, saying the law specifically refers to the disclosure of someone who's under a corruption investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting a previous amendment of the ordinance that narrowed the scope of law, Fok said the purpose of the current section was to protect the integrity of a bribery probe "rather than an ICAC investigation in general."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Tuesday started to conduct joint exercises around Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Theater Command organised its army, navy, air and rocket forces to close in on the island from multiple directions, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Shi, these drills mainly focus on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive superiority, assault on maritime and ground targets, and blockade of key areas and sea lanes to test the joint operation capabilities of the troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drills serve as a stern warning and forceful deterrent against "Taiwan independence" separatist forces, and are a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity, Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said the military exercises serve as a resolute punishment for Lai Ching-te authorities' blatant "Taiwan independence" provocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Taiwan independence' means war, and pursuing 'Taiwan independence' means pushing the people of Taiwan into a perilous situation," Zhu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the mainland's countermeasures specifically target separatist activities advocating "Taiwan independence" and are not directed at the broader population of Taiwan. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jane Street, one of the world's largest quant trading firms and market makers, is planning a sharp increase in Hong Kong office space, two people familiar with the matter said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York-based firm is negotiating with landlord Hongkong Land to lease two more floors at Chater House, an office tower in Central, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the deal materialises, Jane Street will occupy six floors of the 30-storey building, totalling over 110,000 sq ft of office space, compared to just two-and-a-half floors a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street and Hongkong Land declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising Sino-US tensions, China has regained popularity as an investment destination and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 15 percent in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Average daily turnover shot to US$28 billion for the first two months of the year, a 70 percent jump from the same time last year, data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citadel Securities and Tower Research Capital have also been recruiting and expanding their offices in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street employs 400 people in the city, one of the people said, adding that its Hong Kong-based team covers not just the mainland and Hong Kong but also Japan, Singapore and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hiring for more than 40 roles in Hong Kong, the firm's website shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for high-frequency trading and its dominance of the exchange traded funds market, Jane Street has seen explosive growth in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a registered market maker on the Hong Kong bourse and was approved to trade yuan-denominated shares in Hong Kong in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm earned around US$6.1 billion in the first half of last year, nearly double that of the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street plans to take the two floors used by Point72 Asset Management, according to one of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Point72 is moving out because it wants more office space, local media have said. (Reuters)

<img alt="Sales of Tesla EVs are slowing in Europe amid a growing backlash against its CEO Elon Musk over his political views. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798413_1_20250401120524.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla investors are bracing for a drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics exacerbates weakening demand for the electric vehicle maker's lineup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk promised Tesla would return to growth this year after its annual deliveries fell for the first time in 2024, and Wall Street will be watching to see how a refreshed Model Y SUV and incentives made a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has been grappling with rising global competition and mass protests against Musk's role overseeing cuts to federal spending as an adviser to US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said dismay at Musk's government cutbacks plus disdain towards his personal politics was affecting Tesla's business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's certainly has taken a toll on Tesla's stock [price] which rose sharply when Donald Trump won the election with Musk being his biggest financial backer. It hit a record of US$480 and today it's around US$259  ... with regard to sales one thing is quite clear: sales of new Tesla cars have slumped in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been offering discounts and other incentives, including low-cost financing, but these seemed to have had little impact in Europe, where sales declined in the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of China-made Teslas fell as well. Chinese rivals including BYD have ramped up a price war and launched at least six models in the past year to take on the Model Y. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A bitcoin investor who bought a SpaceX flight for himself and three polar explorers has blasted off on the first rocket ride to carry people over the North and South poles .
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Chun, a Chinese-born entrepreneur, hurtled into orbit on Monday night from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX’s Falcon rocket steered southward over the Atlantic, putting the space tourists on a path never flown before in 64 years of human spaceflight .
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang won’t say how much he paid Elon Musk’s SpaceX for the three-and-a-half day ultimate polar adventure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of their flight – from Florida to the South Pole – took barely half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the targeted altitude of some 440 kilometres, their fully automated capsule will circle the globe in roughly one-and-a-half  hours, including 46 minutes to fly from pole to pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Enjoy the views of the poles. Send us some pictures,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the capsule reached orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang has already visited the polar regions in person and wants to view them from space.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trip is also about “pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge,” he said ahead of the flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now a citizen of Malta, he took along three guests: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikkelsen, the first Norwegian bound for space, has flown over the poles before, but at a much lower altitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was part of the 2019 record-breaking mission that circumnavigated the world via the poles in a Gulfstream jet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew plans two dozen experiments – including taking the first human X-rays in space – and brought along more cameras than usual to document their journey called Fram2 after the Norwegian polar research ship from more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until now, no space traveler had ventured beyond 65 degrees north and south latitude, just shy of the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first woman in space, the Soviet Union’s Valentina Tereshkova, set that mark in 1963. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and other pioneering cosmonauts came almost as close, as did NASA shuttle astronauts in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  A polar orbit is ideal for climate and Earth-mapping satellites as well as spy satellites.
  <br>
  <br>
  That’s because a spacecraft can observe the entire world each day, circling Earth from pole to pole as it rotates below.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geir Klover, director of the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway, where the original polar ship is on display, hopes the trip will draw more attention to climate change and the melting polar caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lent the crew a tiny piece of the ship's wooden deck that bears the signature of Oscar Wisting, who with Roald Amundsen in the early 1900s became the first to reach both poles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang pitched the idea of a polar flight to SpaceX in 2023, two years after US tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman made the first of two chartered flights with Musk’s company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaacman is now in the running for NASA’s top job.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's Kiko Dontchev said late last week that the company is continually refining its training so “normal people” without traditional aerospace backgrounds can “hop in a capsule ... and be calm about it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and his crew view the polar flight as like camping in the wild and embrace the challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine and, honestly, I’m happy to see that,” Wang said via X last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said he's been counting up his flights since his first one in 2002, flying on planes, helicopters and hot air balloons in his quest to visit every country.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, he’s visited more than half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arranged it so that liftoff would mark his 1,000th flight. (AP)

    Dongjiang water fuels HK's economic miracle: Lee

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Dongjiang water has fuelled Hong Kong's economic miracle, contributing to the city's sustainable development and long-term prosperity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the International Water Pioneers Summit, Lee said the SAR's water supply is closely tied to the mainland, with 70 to 80 percent of water coming from the Dongjiang River.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum brings together around 400 officials, academics and water experts from around the world to discuss new opportunities in waterworks development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is one of transformation, illustrating how a city with limited water resource, can turn geographic and resource limitations into engineering triumphs," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's water story is also one of deep and abiding ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because without the strong bonds and blood relation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the engineering, and the water it made possible, would not have taken place."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that the water supply capacity increased twelvefold from 68.2 million to 820 million cubic metres with expansions of the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted Hong Kong's vision to become an international infrastructure centre, adding that the Digital Water Office was set up last year to invest in innovative solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same forum, Minister of Water Resources Li Guoying said Beijing is committed to supporting the SAR's water supply despite the growing threat coming as a result of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will actively support Hong Kong in leveraging its unique advantages of having the motherland's backing while being connected to the world, fully playing its role as a bridge and window to share water management concepts, experiences and solutions with countries worldwide," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong, meanwhile, outlined plans to enhance cooperation with Hong Kong in water management through technological innovation, particularly in AI applications.

<img alt="The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong has accused the US of slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798399_1_20250401103258.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has warned of "strong and resolute" countermeasures against fresh sanctions imposed on six mainland and Hong Kong officials by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong accused Washington of smearing the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and a serious violation of the principles of international law and the basic norms governing international relations," a statement by the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said the move to impose sanctions has once again exposed Washington's "evil intentions" of undermining the SAR's prosperity and stability, as well as containing China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will surely take strong and resolute countermeasures," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the officials sanctioned are Dong Jingwei, the director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; justice chief Paul Lam; and outgoing police commissioner Raymond Siu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR police have taken lawful actions against overseas anti-China rioters, and the SAR judicial authorities have independently and impartially tried national security cases following legal procedures," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These acts are consistent with international law and customary practice, and are just and necessary moves to safeguard national security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US also condemned the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese central government resolutely supports the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Hong Kong SAR in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that undermine national security," the embassy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to respect the facts, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop smearing Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law."

    Bangkok reviews construction safety in quake aftermath

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai authorities said they were investigating why a single office tower block under construction in Bangkok collapsed during Friday's earthquake that otherwise caused limited damage in the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt visited the site on Monday as heavy equipment pulled away rubble from the 30-storey State Audit Office building in hopes of finding the 78 people still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even one life saved is worth all the effort, so I think we have to move on, carry on,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the longer run it's important to ensure building safety in the city, where millions of people live and work in thousands of high-rise buildings, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude 7.7 quake, which was centred more than 1,200 km away, killed more than 2,000 people in Myanmar and at least 18 in Thailand, most of them at the Bangkok construction site near the popular Chatuchak Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we need to find the root cause so at least we can learn some lessons and improve building regulations," Chadchart said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the end, we will have some results that will improve safety in Bangkok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the property developer handling the project, Italian Thai Development, fell 27 percent in trading on Monday as questions were raised about the building's design, enforcement of construction safety codes, and the Chinese contractor building the State Audit Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, whose family owns one of Thailand’s largest construction conglomerates, said he has ordered an investigation committee to be set up and to report the results back to him within seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to three possible factors behind the collapse: the designer, the inspectors or the builders. (AP)

    Impeachment crunch time for Yoon on Friday

<img alt="Yoon Suk-yeol will learn whether he has the top job in South Korea come Friday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798397_1_20250401101622.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Constitutional Court said it will rule on whether to formally dismiss or reinstate impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It has been deliberating on Yoon’s political fate over his ill-fated imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The won reversed earlier losses to turn higher against the US dollar after the announcement of the ruling date.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market's benchmark KOSPI was up 1.5 percent after the announcement of the ruling, after pairing earlier gains to 0.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court, which currently has eight justices with one seat vacant, can decide to oust Yoon only when six or more judges agree, according to South Korea's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whatever decision is, it will likely deepen domestic divisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millions have rallied in Seoul and elsewhere to support or denounce Yoon in the past few months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they’ll mobilise all available personnel to preserve order and respond to acts of vandalism, arson and assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled liberal National Assembly in December voted to impeach Yoon, a conservative, leaving his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing a separate criminal trial after he was arrested and indicted by prosecutors in January on rebellion charges in connection with his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court’s endorsement of Yoon’s impeachment would officially drive him out of office and prompt a national election within two months to find a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it overturns Yoon’s impeachment, he would immediately return to his presidential duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the matter is Yoon’s decision to send hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has insisted that he aimed to maintain order, but some military and military officials have said Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to frustrate a floor vote on his decree and detain his political opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon argues that he didn’t intend to maintain martial law for long, and he only wanted to highlight what he called the “wickedness” of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda, impeached senior officials and slashed his budget bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his martial law announcement, he called the assembly “a den of criminals” and “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, a president has the right to declare martial law in wartime or other emergency situations, but the Democratic Party and its supporters say South Korea wasn’t in such a situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party-led impeachment motion accused Yoon of suppressing parliament's activities, attempting to detain politicians and others and undermining peace in violation of the constitution and other laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has said he had no intention of disrupting National Assembly operations and detaining anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law lasted only six hours because lawmakers managed to enter the assembly and vote to strike down his decree unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>
  No violence erupted, but live TV footage showing armed soldiers arriving at the assembly invoked painful memories of past military-backed dictatorships. It was the first time for South Korea to be placed under martial law since 1980. (AP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 97.53 points, or 0.42 percent, to open at 23,217.11 points on Tuesday, as the market prepares for more news about US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day" and has pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, a private-sector survey has shown that mainland factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in March, buoyed by stronger demand and robust export orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.2 last month from 50.8 in February. That was higher than analyst expectations of 51.1. A number above 50 signals growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebound broadly aligned with an official PMI released on Monday that showed manufacturing activity growing at its quickest rate in a year. (with additional reporting by agencies)

<img alt="Wang Yi gave a wide-ranging interview to the Russian RIA state news agency, on his visit to Moscow. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798386_1_20250401092729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A peace agreement on ending the conflict in Ukraine should be fair, binding and acceptable to all parties involved, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in remarks published on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We advocate eradicating the causes of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations, ultimately achieving a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved, which would make it possible to achieve truly lasting peace and stability in Eurasia and throughout the world," Wang told the Russian RIA state news agency in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang is on a three-day visit to Moscow for strategic cooperation talks, surrounded by uncertainty around the partial ceasefire in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump striking a critical tone against the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  China calls for the peace talks to continue, Wang told RIA in a wide-ranging interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The step towards peace, although not that big, is constructive - it's worth building on it," Wang said. "With peace, it is no pain no gain. You need to work hard to achieve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Russia and the United States had taken the first step toward normalising relations, "which is good for stabilising the balance of power between major powers and inspires optimism in a disappointing international situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Russia declared a "no limits" strategic partnership days before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Monday that Putin would receive Wang, who would also hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang reiterated to RIA that Beijing is ready to play a role in settling the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready, taking into account the aspirations of the parties involved, to play a constructive role in the settlement together with the international community, primarily with the countries of the Global South," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has been pushing for a greater involvement of China in peace talks since the early days of the war, which marked its third anniversary in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has proposed on its own, and together with Brazil, general principles to end the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Russia and China bear a special responsibility to maintain world peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our countries, as each other's largest neighbouring states, world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace and development throughout the world," Wang said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar will mark a minute of silence on Tuesday in tribute to victims of the country's devastating earthquake that has killed more than 2,000 people, as hopes dim of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive quake, the ruling junta said in a statement on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of a week of national mourning, the junta announced the minute's silence to begin Tuesday at 12:51:02 pm - the precise time the 7.7-magnitude quake struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  People should stop where they are to pay respect to the victims, the junta said, while media should halt broadcasting and show mourning symbols, and prayers will be offered at temples and pagodas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said Monday that 2,056 have now been confirmed dead, with more than 3,900 people injured and 270 still missing, but the toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three Chinese nationals are said to be among the dead, along with two French people.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 19 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Thailand's capital Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diggers continue to clear the vast pile of rubble at the site, where a dozen deaths have been confirmed and at least 75 people are still unaccounted for. Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States said on Monday it had dispatched a disaster relief team to Myanmar, defending the pace of the deployment following President Donald Trump's dismantling of America's main overseas aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck on Friday, on the same day that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was formally dissolving the US Agency for International Development (USAID), arguing that the "gains were too few and the costs were too high," after cutting more than 80 percent of its projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India have already sent teams to Myanmar. (AFP)

    Nasa's astronauts speak after unexpected stay in space

<img alt="Nasa astronauts, from left - Nick Hague, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore - speak out for the first time since their return to Earth. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798377_1_20250401090640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams said on Monday that they hold themselves partly responsible for what went wrong on their extended stay in space and would fly on Boeing's Starliner again.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX recently ferried the duo home after more than nine months at the International Space Station, filling in for Boeing, which returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their first news conference since coming home, the pair said they were taken aback by all the interest and insisted they were only doing their job and putting the mission ahead of themselves and even their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore didn't shy from accepting some of the blame for Boeing's bungled test flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ll start and point the finger and I’ll blame me. I could have asked some questions and the answers to those questions could have turned the tide,” he told reporters. “All the way up and down the chain. We all are responsible. We all own this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both astronauts said they would strap into Starliner again. “Because we're going to rectify all the issues that we encountered. We're going to fix them. We're going to make it work,” Wilmore said, adding he'd go back up “in a heartbeat.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams noted that Starliner has “a lot of capability” and she wants to see it succeed. “We're all in,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two will meet with Boeing leadership on Wednesday to provide a rundown on the flight and its problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not for pointing fingers,” Wilmore said. “It's just to make the path clearer going forward.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The longtime astronauts and retired Navy captains ended up spending 286 days in space - 278 days more than planned when they blasted off on Boeing’s first astronaut flight on June 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test pilots had to intervene in order for the Starliner capsule to reach the space station, as thrusters failed and helium leaked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their space station stay kept getting extended as engineers debated how to proceed. NASA finally judged Starliner too dangerous to bring Wilmore and Williams back and transferred them to SpaceX. But the launch of their replacements got stalled, stretching their mission beyond nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dragged-out drama finally ended two weeks ago with a flawless splashdown by SpaceX off the Florida Panhandle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa said engineers still do not understand why Starliner’s thrusters malfunctioned; more tests are planned through the summer. If engineers can figure out the thruster and leak issues, “Starliner is ready to go," Wilmore said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency may require another test flight - with cargo - before allowing astronauts to climb aboard. That redo could come by year's end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Starliner’s rocky road, Nasa officials said they stand behind the decision made years ago to have two competing US companies providing taxi service to and from the space station. But time is running out: The space station is set to be abandoned in five years and replaced in orbit by privately operated labs. (AP)

    Trump task force to review Harvard's funding

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harvard University has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s approach to fight campus anti-semitism, with the announcement of a new “comprehensive review” that could jeopardise billions of dollars for the Ivy League college.
 <br>
  <br>
  A federal anti-semitism task force is reviewing more than US$255 million in contracts between Harvard and the federal government to make sure the school is following civil rights laws, the administration announced on Monday. The government also will examine US$8.7 billion in grant commitments to Harvard and its affiliates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same task force cut US$400 million from Columbia University and threatened to slash billions more if it refused a list of demands from President Donald Trump's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columbia agreed to many of the changes this month, drawing praise from some Jewish groups and condemnation from free speech groups, who see it as a stunning intrusion by the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of other universities have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they could face similar treatment over allegations of anti-semitism. The federal government is a major provider of revenue for American universities through grants for scientific research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Harvard symbolises the American Dream, but has jeopardised its reputation by “promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry” and failing to protect students from anti-semitism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard President Alan Garber acknowledged that anti-semitism exists even on his campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he said Harvard has done much to fight it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard will ensure the government has a full account of the university's work, Garber said. If federal funding is pulled, he added, it will “halt life-saving research and imperil important scientific research and innovation.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker player Ng On-yee on Monday defeated World No. 1 Mink Nutcharut of Thailand to defend her title at the British Open in Walsall, England.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng's 4-3 victory is the SAR athlete's second ranking crown of the season, following her dominance at the US Women's Snooker Open in August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also solidifies her hold on second place in the world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng, 34, has now claimed 22 ranking titles since her maiden victory in 2012, when she won the Northern Championship without losing a frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was close to her best throughout the tournament, having scored four of the top five breaks – including a near-flawless century break of 113 during her quarter-final victory against compatriot So Man-yan on Sunday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza has reportedly left at least 322 children dead and 609 wounded in the Palestinian territory in the past 10 days, UNICEF said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures include children who were reportedly killed or wounded when the surgical department of Al Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza, was hit in an attack on March 23, the UN children's agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF said most of these children were displaced, and sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ending a nearly two-month ceasefire in the war with Hamas, Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 and then launched a new ground offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery," said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell added: "All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children."
  <br>
  <br>
  The UNICEF statement said that after nearly 18 months of war, more than 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children have been displaced repeatedly and denied basic services.
  <br>
  <br>
  UNICEF called for an end to hostilities and for Israel to end its ban on humanitarian aid entering Gaza, which has been in force since March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said children who are sick or wounded should be evacuated to receive medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Food, safe water, shelter, and medical care have become increasingly scarce. Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths," UNICEF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must not stand by and allow the killing and suffering of children to continue," it added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Tuesday condemned the United States after the US put six mainland and Hong Kong officials on its sanctions list.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said the move exposed US barbarity under its hegemony. It also said it would not be intimidated and that SAR officials would continue to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials concerned are Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; Paul Lam, the Secretary for Justice; Raymond Siu, the Police Commissioner; Sonny Au, the secretary-general for the committee for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong; Dick Wong, assistant commissioner of the police - national security; and Margaret Chiu, assistant commissioner of police - national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact is that the US has been ignoring the non-interference principle under international law, interfering with other countries' internal affairs, grooming agents, instigating 'colour revolutions', creating social unrest and multiple humanitarian disasters through economic and military coercion, causing suffering to people in many countries," an SAR government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, those who are suspected to have committed offences endangering national security and absconded overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the US State Department accused the officials of using Hong Kong national security laws extraterritorially in relation to 19 people who had fled overseas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major League Baseball has suspended Atlanta Braves slugger Jurickson Profar for 80 games after he tested positive for the performance-enhancing chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), MLB announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspension of the 32-year-old outfielder is more bad news for an Atlanta team that has started the season 0-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  He signed a three-year, US$42 million deal with the Braves in January, and will be suspended through the end of June. Although he can return in July for the remainder of the regular season, Profar will not be eligible to play in the 2025 postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that Jurickson Profar tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program," the Braves said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar, who hit a career-high 24 home runs for the San Diego Padres last year, issued a statement through the MLB Players Association, calling the announcement "the most difficult day of my baseball career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar wrote in a statement that he tested positive in the off-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to apologise to the entire Braves organisation, my teammates, and the fans," he said. He added that he "would never knowingly do anything to cheat" and that he "would never willingly take a banned substance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I take full responsibility and accept MLB's decision," he concluded. (AFP)

    Trump will 'be kind' over further tariffs this week

<img alt="US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798346_1_20250401021518.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said Monday he would be "very kind" to trading partners when he unveils further tariffs this week, risking global turmoil to address what he says are unfair trade imbalances.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump - who has been making unprecedented use of presidential powers since taking office in January - said he could announce as early as Tuesday night exactly what "reciprocal tariffs" will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican billionaire insists that reciprocal action is needed because the world's biggest economy has been "ripped off by every country in the world," promising "Liberation Day" for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could also unveil more sector-specific levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for details, he told reporters Monday: "You're going to see in two days, which is maybe tomorrow night or probably Wednesday."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added: "We're going to be very nice, relatively speaking, we're going to be very kind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics warn that the strategy risks a global trade war, provoking a chain reaction of retaliation by major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already, China, South Korea and Japan agreed on Sunday to strengthen free trade between themselves, ahead of Trump's expected tariff announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said on Monday that he was not worried his action would push allies toward Beijing, adding that a deal on TikTok could also be tied to China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, President Trump downplayed risks that TikTok was in danger of being banned in the United States, saying he was confident of finding a buyer for the app's US business by a Friday deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has over 170 million American users, is under threat from a law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or face a ban in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced a delay that has allowed it to continue to operate; that delay is set to expire on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it, because they may have something to do with it," he said, adding "I'd like to see TikTok remain alive." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were dealt a major blow with leading scorer Erling Haaland set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury as the season reaches its climax.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Norwegian was injured in Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having just scored his 30th goal of the season to level the tie, he was then hurt in a challenge with Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League champions did not provide a timescale for the player's return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expectation is that Erling will be fit in time to play a further part in the remainder of this season, including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup," said a club statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Erling underwent initial tests in Manchester on Monday morning and will now seek specialist consultation to confirm the full extent of the injury. Assessment remains ongoing to ascertain a full prognosis," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are currently fifth in the Premier League and battling to ensure a spot in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side face matches against Leicester and Manchester United this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then have a visit from Crystal Palace and a trip to Everton before their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, at Wembley on April 26. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana will all involve 23 teams from this year, with the initiative rubber-stamped by the International Cycling Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra teams come from extra wildcard invitations, an initiative proposed by the Professional Cycling Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of riders will shift from 176 under the 22-team model, to 184 with 23 teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UCI Management Committee has approved the request submitted by the PCC to increase the number of teams participating in the men's Grand Tours (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and La Vuelta a Espana) to 23," the UCI said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expansion aims to support second division teams, while enabling organisers to strengthen the line-up for their race and give riders from the additional teams the opportunity to compete in a Grand Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 18 top-tier World Tour teams take part in the Grand Tours, with extra invitations given to teams from the second-tier Pro Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tour de France organisers immediately announced their full line-up for the 2025 race with the top two Pro-Tour teams Lotto and Israel Premier Tech, plus three wild cards in Total Energies, Tudor Pro Cycling and Uno X Mobility. (AFP)

 Rory McIlroy has joined Tiger Woods in surpassing US$100 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, becoming just the second player to do so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Northern Irishman reached the landmark during the Houston Open over the past weekend, where a four-way tie for fifth netted him more than US$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, 35, has secured 28 victories out of 262 PGA Tour events since his debut in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods, now 49, crossed the US$100 million threshold in 2012 and has since accumulated US$120 million in prize money with 82 wins in 378 events. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off some early gloom about Donald Trump's imminent tariff announcement to close mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 bouncing into positive territory from a six-month low.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day," and pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the uncertainty, volatility surged in early trading on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index, colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumping more than 10 percent before cooling sharply as the day progressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an earlier decline to close up 1.0 percent at 42,001.76, as did the broad-based S&P 500 Index, which gained 0.6 percent to 5,611.85.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.1 percent to 17,299.29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the resurgence, the S&P posted its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [traders] were taking advantage of an oversold situation," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They still have another day in which to sort of play around," before Trump's big tariff announcement, Stovall added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Moderna fell 8.9 percent after the departure of a top US Food and Drug Administration official who disagreed with Trump's new health secretary, noted vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday reaffirmed its resolute opposition to moves that infringe upon and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonic practices or bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun made the remarks in response to a media query related to CK Hutchison's planned sale of certain port assets to a BlackRock-led group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have taken note of relevant reports," Guo said at a regular press briefing, adding that "the State Administration for Market Regulation is aware of the deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo emphasised that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion and bullying to infringe upon and undermine the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted another article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article quoted Hong Kong business and political figures as saying deals like this may involve national interests, and CK Hutchison should consider how its decision would impact the SAR and the country. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Kremlin says Putin 'remains open' to speaking to Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) earlier criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress on a ceasefire deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798328_1_20250331211156.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday said that President Vladimir Putin was still "open" to speaking to Donald Trump after the US president said he was "very angry" with the Russian leader over little progress on a ceasefire in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier criticised both Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, as he pushes to end more than three years of conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told NBC he was "pissed off" at Putin for questioning Zelensky's credibility as someone to negotiate with and for calling for new authorities in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president remains open to contact with President Trump," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a briefing call.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no phone call scheduled between the two leaders, but that one could be "organised promptly" if deemed "necessary".
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin earlier this month rejected a US proposal of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, that Zelensky backed, and has upped his rhetoric on Moscow wanting to install new leadership in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are continuing work.. Firstly, on developing bilateral relations and also working on implementing some ideas, linked to resolving the Ukrainian (conflict)," Peskov said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Work is ongoing. There is nothing concrete yet. This process is time-consuming, probably due to the fact of the complexity of the substance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, NBC News journalist Kristen Walker said Trump had called her to say he was angry with Putin and threatened tariffs on firms dealing with Russian oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later said he was "disappointed" with Putin for his comments on Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don't like him," Trump said. (AFP)

 A "megaquake" and subsequent tsunami could cause up to 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to US$2 trillion, the government said on Monday in a new estimate.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figures have been updated from a previous estimate, made in 2014, for the potential consequences of a huge earthquake along the Nankai Trough south of Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 800-kilometre undersea trench runs from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu island.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is where the Philippine Sea oceanic tectonic plate is "subducting" –  or slowly slipping – underneath the continental plate that Japan sits atop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plates become stuck as they move, storing up vast amounts of energy that is released when they break free, causing potentially massive earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cabinet Office's disaster management working group said up to 215,000 people would be killed by a tsunami, 73,000 by the collapse of buildings and 9,000 by fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the predicted toll as a whole is lower than the 2014 estimate that said up to 323,000 people would die.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 1,400 years, megaquakes in the Nankai Trough have occurred every 100 to 200 years. The last one happened in 1946.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say it is extremely difficult to predict quakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in January, a government panel said the probability of such a megaquake in the next 30 years has marginally increased, with a 75-82 percent chance of it happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its first "megaquake advisory" under rules drawn up after the devastating 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the likelihood of a new major earthquake along the Nankai Trough was higher than normal after a magnitude 7.1 jolt in southern Japan that injured 14 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advisory was lifted after a week but caused shortages of rice and other staples as people replenished their emergency stocks. (AFP)

    HA unveils smart measures to better monitor patients

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday announced a series of smart measures in accident and emergency departments and wards to better monitor patients and reduce medical mishaps.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is a geofencing system aimed at preventing dementia patients from wandering off which will be used in all hospitals by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a patient with a special wristband walks too close to an exit door, an alarm will sound to alert hospital staff, said the authority's director of quality and safety Michael Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they get away from our accident and emergency departments, it will be very difficult for us to find them. And they might have some accident or deterioration during the missing period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the authority will expand its use of smart oxygen cylinders with alarms that activate when the main switch isn't turned on before use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the gas is nearly empty, it will also have an alarm. It will ensure that our staff will turn on the main switch and ensure that if the gas is running out, we will replace a new one as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authority is also implementing a new reporting system that will use AI and big data to analyse trends and patterns in medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can make use of the data to have early trending and to find out the common contributing factors to incidents so as to prevent future similar events from happening," said Raymond Cheung, a chief manager with the authority.

 Four of the world’s top football teams will be coming to Hong Kong this summer for pre-season friendlies as they gear up for the 2025-26 season, organisers said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  English Premier League giant Liverpool and Serie A side AC Milan will face off on July 26 for the Standard Chartered Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two other English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will meet on July 31, marking the first north London derby outside of the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two games will take place at the new 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium, with the retractable roof closed and air conditioning under each seat to make the upcoming hot and humid weather more bearable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rachael Carroll, managing director of TEG sport, organiser and promoter of the festival, said the Hong Kong Football Festival will attract at least 100,000 fans both locally and from outside the SAR, which will generate great value for the local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a wonderful opportunity to really launch Kai Tak Sports Park globally, really put this on the map, and these are fantastic rivalries and to have these two big matches, two great rivalries to really celebrate the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and have the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, we thought that that was appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course in the future, we would love to see international teams play local teams here in the market as well, so we think that this is going to be a great location for football in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser also said the three Premier League clubs will also hold open training sessions on July 24, 29 and 30 for fans to watch before the two exhibition matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ticket details will be announced shortly by the organiser.

    Retail sales slip again in February

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped by 13 percent year on year in February, partly due to high pre-festival spending from the Lunar New Year holiday falling in the same month last year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798288_1_20250331172638.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales suffered a notable decline last month, dropping by 13 percent year on year partially due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday showed that turnover of the city's total retail sales was provisionally estimated to be HK$29.4 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was significantly lower compared with HK$35.4 billion registered in January when sales dropped by 3.1 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking the first two months of the year together, the value retail sales were estimated to have decreased by 7.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volume of retail sales also notably declined, dropping by 15 percent, compared with the 5.1 percent retreat seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year, the total volume declined by 9.9 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the figures, a government spokesperson said the steep declines were partly due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in late January this year but in February last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumer spending in the local market normally attains a seasonal high before the festival," a government statement reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that when retail sales for the first two months of the year were bunched together, which could remove such a holiday effect, the decline was smaller compared with the drop in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the spokesperson acknowledged the challenges ahead but said various measures by the central and the SAR governments will offer support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government's proactive efforts to promote tourism and mega events, and the sustained increases in employment earnings in local labour market, would benefit the retail sector, though it would continue to face challenges from the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysed by categories, sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most significant decline – dropping by nearly 50 percent in the first two months of the year while that of furniture and fixtures decreased by 25.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, however, rose 0.7 percent year on year, followed closely by the 0.6 percent seen for medicines and cosmetics.

    Le Pen hit with immediate court ban on public office

<img alt="Marine Le Pen arrives in court for the verdict. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798290_1_20250331172739.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Monday banned far-right leader Marine Le Pen from running for office after her conviction over a fake jobs scheme, specifying that the sanction should come into force with immediate effect even if an appeal is lodged.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling could mean that Le Pen will not be able to stand for president in 2027 elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  She left the courtroom after her conviction and this sanction were announced, but before the judge announced rulings on a potential prison sentence and fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court had earlier in the day found Le Pen guilty of misappropriating EU funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally, is the front-runner in opinion polls ahead of the 2027 vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had asked that Le Pen face an immediate five-year ban from public office if found guilty, regardless of any appeal process, using a so-called "provisional execution" measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  An automatic five-year ban would hammer Le Pen, 56, a three-time presidential contender who has said 2027 will be her final run for top office.
  <br>
  <br>
  She would retain her parliamentary seat until the end of her mandate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her "political death," alleging a plot to keep the National Rally from power that echoes claims made by US President Donald Trump about his legal woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen, the National Rally and two dozen party figures were accused of diverting European parliament funds to pay France-based party staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendants said the money was used legitimately and the allegations define too narrowly what a parliamentary assistant does.
  <br>
  <br>
  However judge Benedicte de Perthuis ruled: "It was established that all these people were actually working for the party, that their [European Union] lawmaker had not given them any tasks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investigations also showed that these were not administrative errors ... but embezzlement within the framework of a system put in place to reduce the party's costs."  (Reuters)

    Myanmar marks quake with week of mourning

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's ruling junta declared a week of national mourning on Monday for the country's devastating earthquake, which has killed more than 1,700 people, as hopes faded of finding more survivors in the rubble of ruined buildings.
 <br>
  <br>
  National flags will fly at half-mast until April 6 "in sympathy for the loss of life and damages" from Friday's massive 7.7-magnitude quake, the junta said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the tempo and urgency of rescue efforts wound down in Mandalay, one of the worst-affected cities and the country's second-largest, with more than 1.7 million inhabitants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is so dire that it's hard to express what is happening," said Aung Myint Hussein, chief administrator of Mandalay's Sajja North mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  People camped out in the streets across Mandalay overnight, either unable to return to ruined homes or nervous about the repeated aftershocks that rattled the city over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some had tents but many, including young children, simply bedded down on blankets in the middle of the roads, trying to keep as far from buildings as possible for fear of falling masonry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people are confirmed dead across Myanmar, according to the military junta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more were injured and more than 300 remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 18 deaths have been confirmed hundreds of kilometres away in Bangkok, where the force of the quake caused a 30-storey tower block under construction to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with communications down in much of Myanmar, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge and the death toll is expected to rise significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mandalay's 1,000-bed general hospital has been evacuated, with hundreds of patients being treated outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With temperatures forecast to hit 40 degrees Celsius on Monday, patients lay on gurneys in the hospital car park, many with only a thin tarpaulin rigged up to shield them from the fierce tropical sun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives did their best to comfort them, holding hands or waving bamboo fans over them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone," said one medic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to do what we can here. We are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sticky heat has exhausted rescue workers and accelerated body decomposition, which could complicate identification.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traffic began returning to the streets of Mandalay on Monday, and restaurants and street vendors resumed work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of Muslims gathered outside a destroyed mosque in the city for the first prayer of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that follows the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aftershocks rattled Mandalay over the weekend, several times sending residents fleeing into the streets in brief moments of panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The challenges facing the Southeast Asian country of more than 50 million people were immense even before the earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar has been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021, with its economy shattered and healthcare and infrastructure badly damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organization declared the quake a top-level emergency as it urgently sought US$8 million to save lives and prevent disease outbreaks over the next 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an appeal for more than US$100 million to help victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue teams have been arriving after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing made an exceptionally rare appeal for foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, isolated Myanmar's ruling generals have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun thanked key allies China and Russia for their help, as well as India, and said the authorities were doing their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Bangkok, rain fell on Monday morning at the site of the collapsed building, where diggers continued to clear the vast pile of rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they have not given up hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage, where 11 deaths have been confirmed and at least 76 people are still unaccounted for. (AFP)

 Hong Kong has become a lot cleaner in recent times with scores of rear lanes tidied up, dog mess issues resolved and waste dumping brought to an end in various locations, the government said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration said it has removed more than 600 sites from its "hygiene black spot" list after tackling issues that also included wild birds congregating, graffiti, rodent infestations, abandoned vehicles and shop front extensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only around 100 problem sites remain on the list that was first compiled in 2022, suffering from the above problems and other headaches such as illegally parked bicycles and dripping air-conditioners
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hygiene conditions at 94 percent (696) of the hygiene black spots on the list have been markedly improved and could be considered for removal from the black spot list," said Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government's work on tackling hygiene black spots is ongoing. The departments concerned will continue to sustain their efforts and closely monitor the hygiene conditions of these spots. Prompt actions will be taken in case of any change of circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also expressed gratitude for efforts over the past two years to revamp the cityscape and hygiene conditions.

 Officials have brushed off concerns that landlords might be hesitant about getting their dwellings declared as basic housing units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, saying they would not consider extending a registration period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration on Monday also suggested the possibility of establishing a reporting mechanism on homes breaching such rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the government proposal, landlords will be given 12 months to register their properties before having three years to make necessary improvements to be certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why owners would not register if they intend to continue to operate," Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong told lawmakers when asked if registration numbers are low.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're not going to extend the [registration] period... The consequence of not registering is serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  To be certified as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the administration is considering charging landlords by residential units and that officials will study suggestions that fees should be based on home sizes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also addressed worries from lawmakers that some landlords might not comply with the regulations and operate subpar homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The design of the [basic housing unit] regime comes with a very sufficient grace period and registration period," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our requirements are very pragmatic... These are all doable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may need a reporting mechanism to catch the most serious cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping to introduce a bill on regulating the compact homes in the latter half of this year.

    HK 'remains art hub despite global market decline'

<img alt="Lindsay Dewar says declining sales at events such as Art Basel Hong Kong reflect a global trend. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798264_1_20250331161511.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong just wrapped up another year of art festivals, including Art Basel and Art Central this month, and they have led an investor to say the city remains an important hub for the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1014051&livetime=20250331000000" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , ArtTactic chief operating officer Lindsay Dewar said last year was a tough one for the market since its peak back in 2022 and despite its recovery from the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year saw a decline of 27 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she said there is "a new normality" in the market and "people are finding their footing again."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a notable decline in modern and contemporary art sales in the SAR and the mainland, Dewar says Hong Kong remains the third largest art centre worldwide for auction sales and that market sales globally has doubled over the past 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's really remarkable to see a market grow so much in such a relatively short period and that really speaks to the confidence the art community sees in Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that Hong Kong still accounts for up to 81 percent of total art sales in both the SAR and the mainland, showing its importance in this portion of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on a decline in auction turnover at Art Basel Hong Kong recently, Dewar thinks it reflects more of the general world market trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is kind of a broader trend that we're seeing, and it's worth bearing in mind that the sale we had in London at the beginning of this month was also down," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dewar also noted that a new generation of art collectors is emerging that is seeking more affordable artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Latest tariff uncertainties and reduced returns over assets recently have impacted the global art market, and Dewar believes there are two main impacts.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said shorter holding periods are one of them, with people being less speculative and wanting to hold on to their artworks longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another is that market may become more regional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a while after Covid people are looking at the market and thinking where's the best part of the market for me to sell in... whereas now we might see people saying I'm in Hong Kong and I'm going to stay in Hong Kong... so like the American market may become more American," Dewar said.

    US tariffs to target 'all countries'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the tariffs he plans to impose in the coming days would include "all countries," not just those with the largest trade imbalances with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised a "Liberation Day" on Wednesday, when he is set to unveil reciprocal levies to address trade practices that his government deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens," he said onboard Air Force One, dashing hopes he might scale back some of the threatened levies or that they would target a select group with persistent trade imbalances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't heard a rumor about 15 countries, 10 or 15," he said when asked which nations would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been talking about all countries, not a cutoff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's upcoming tariff salvo had been expected to target the 15 percent of partners that have persistent trade imbalances with the United States, a group Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called a "Dirty 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite widening the target, the president insisted his tariffs would be more "generous" than those levied against the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and additional levies on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on imported autos are also due to take effect on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's top trade aide Peter Navarro said the tax on auto imports could raise US$100 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And in addition, the other tariffs are going to raise about US$600 billion a year, about US$6 trillion over a 10-year period," Navarro said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plans to unleash a wide range of reciprocal tariffs risk a global trade war, with other countries already vowing to retaliate and economists warning the sweeping moves risk stoking inflation and triggering a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has defended the levies as a way to raise government revenue and revitalize US industry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country’s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning through more than 48,000 hectares.
 <br>
  <br>
  The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire to clear overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday and plan to question the man soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the seventh century.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were two state-designated “treasures,” a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668 and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king. (AP)

 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    Data breach of 128,000 'due to system fix and neglect'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data says a data breach incident by ImagineX has led to nearly 128,000 people’s information being compromised.
 <br>
  <br>
  Failing to delete temporary accounts in a timely manner and the use of end-of-support operating systems were the main factors leading to the breach, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog said in May it received a report from ImagineX Management, a brand management company, about a ransom note related to stolen personal data.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an investigation, the office found that the hacker had exploited a temporary user account and then used it to access the company’s intranet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 68GB of personal data – involving names, email addresses, phone numbers, birth months, genders and nationalities – of the nearly 128,000 people were compromised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said those affected were mostly from brands who participated in ImagineX Management ‘s two membership programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, there’s no evidence indicating the stolen data is being circulated or misused, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief personal data officer Brad Kwok said the company had set up a temporary account with remote access to fix a system problem but forgot to delete it afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This allowed the threat actor to exploit the account to compromise the network 10 days after the account was set up,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the investigation, we also found that ImagineX lacked standard procedures for creating and managing temporary accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made the deletion of the temporary account solely dependent on measures taken by individual staff members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the company had also used an operating system that had no longer been updated since 2020, making it vulnerable to attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also accused of having inefficient detection measures and not conducting sufficient security risk reviews and audits for its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD said it issued an enforcement notice to ImagineX as it contravened the data protection principle and urged the company to take measures to prevent similar contraventions.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI guidelines for employees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) on Monday issued a checklist to guide organisations in regulating their employees’ use of generative artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said the checklist is important as the secure use of AI is an essential part of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the areas of technological development and industrial innovation, the country has all along stressed the equal importance of development and safety,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to implement the spirit of the Two Sessions… and in order to facilitate the safe and healthy development and use of AI in Hong Kong, my office published the checklist on guidelines for the use of generative AI by employees today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations must specify tasks in which employees are allowed to use AI, with examples including drafting documents, summarising information and creating video and audio content.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should also clearly define which AI tools employees can use, which may include publicly-available or internally developed systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The devices that can access the AI tools should also be regulated, the PCPD noted, as organisations are advised to establish clear distinctions between work devices and personal devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisations should also spell out the penalties or review mechanisms for employees who don’t adhere to the guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said organisations need to be particularly careful if they want to train their AI models with data from clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, when you first collect the data, you did not tell them that it would be used for training AI but subsequently you want to [do so],” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And you will need to obtain the customer's expressed and voluntary consent to do that under the Privacy Ordinance.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The full checklist of the newly released guidelines is available for download on the  PCPD’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said a hotline has been set up for organisations to make enquiries about how to use AI safely and properly.

 The City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and the University of Cambridge signed a global research collaboration deal on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the deal, 18 top post-doctoral researchers from around the world will be based in Cambridge, taking advantage of its laboratories and resources under supervision by principal investigators from both universities for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU council chairman Michael Ngai said the collaboration aligns with the strategic goals of the Hong Kong government.
  <br>
  <br>
  'It serves as a vital step in further establishing Hong Kong as a premier international hub of higher education," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six colleges and departments from each university will be collaborating together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key research areas range from 3D medical data to creativity in an age of intelligent machines.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU said the institution plans to offer attractive presidential assistant professorship positions to postdoctoral fellows upon the completion of their research contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This collaboration now represents a single largest postdoctoral fellowship programme between University of Cambridge in Asia and an Asian university," CityU president Freddy Boey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the signing ceremony, University of Cambridge vice-chancellor Deborah Prentice said "this partnership will enable these outstanding scholars to have the freedom to continue to push the frontiers of research in addressing global challenges."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that CityU has recently been recognised as the world's most international university by Times Higher Education in both 2024 and 2025.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking into the possibility of having a single contractor design, build and operate a planned cross-border railway in the northwestern New Territories and says officials will start gauging developers' interest later this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Rail Link, which is a key component of the Northern Metropolis, is aimed at connecting Hung Shui Kiu with Qianhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Estimated to come into operation in 2035, the proposed 18-kilometre cross-border railway is expected to take residents from one place to the other in 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan said the administration is considering different options for the project, including a "design, build and operate" contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the second half of the year when we invite intentions and expressions, we will then know whether [it can be] a design, build and operate [model] or whether it is [having] design and build as a contract and then operation as another contract," Chan told lawmakers on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experienced operators can take up the operation solely, or they can partner up with other operating companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three stations along the proposed link will be in Hong Kong and two will be across the border. A co-location arrangement is expected to be adopted for immigration and customs facilities on the Shenzhen side.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some lawmakers called for both of the stations in Shenzhen to have checkpoints, the transport chief said officials are still hammering out details of the arrangement with mainland counterparts.
