    Trump threatens tariffs unless EU buys more oil, gas

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday threatened the European Union with tariffs if the bloc does not reduce its "tremendous" trade gap with Washington through oil and gas purchases.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large-scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform in the early hours of Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US figures, goods imports from the EU were US$553.3 billion in 2022, while its exports to the bloc were US$350.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  This puts the US goods trade deficit with the EU at US$202.5 billion that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had already suggested to Trump in November that the United States could supply more liquefied natural gas to the bloc to replace Russian energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replying to questions on Trump's threat on Friday, an EU spokesman said the 27-nation bloc was open to talks, noting that the US also enjoyed "a substantial trade in services surplus vis a vis the EU."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector," EU spokesman Olof Gill told a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office in January, has made sweeping threats of slapping tariffs on US trading partners – including Canada, Mexico and China – which could send reverberations across the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing Canada and Mexico of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants, he had threatened a 25-percent import tariff, while vowing at least 10 percent against Chinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the European Union concluded a massive trade deal with four South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which aims to create a 700-million-customer free-trade area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Von der Leyen had said the agreement would build trade bridges as "strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation" – comments largely seen as a nod to Trump's threats to hike tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts have said Trump's tariff threats could be bluster, or an opening shot for leverage in future trade negotiations when he comes into office.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has continually insisted that "properly used" tariffs would be positive for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country right now loses to everybody," he told reporters at his Florida residence earlier this week. "Tariffs will make our country rich." (AFP)

    English Rugby Union chairman quits amid pay row

<img alt="Tom Ilube had been facing calls for his removal after a grassroots revolt. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784410_1_20241220203617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby Football Union chairman Tom Ilube has stepped down amid a row over the scale of the governing body's executive bonuses, saying the issue had become a "distraction."
 <br>
  <br>
  The move on Friday follows an outcry over RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney's paycheck of £1.1 million (US$1.37 million) for the 2023/24 financial year, which included a bonus of £358,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported that Bill Beaumont, who held the role from 2012 to 2016 and in November stepped down as World Rugby chairman, is being lined up to fill the position on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game, but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place," Ilube said in a statement issued by the RFU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RFU, which held an emergency council meeting on Wednesday, has announced an independent review of its executive pay scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube had been facing motions calling for his removal after a grassroots revolt gathered enough support to trigger a special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed," said Ilube's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the game are furious at the amount earned by Sweeney given the RFU reported an operating loss of £37.9 million for the same period, the highest it has ever recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 42 staff were made redundant in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the pitch, the England men's team won just five of their 12 matches in 2024 and grassroots participation is in decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweeney's position is also under threat, with a motion for the RFU board to dismiss him set to be tabled at the forthcoming special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube was head of the remuneration committee that signed off the long-term incentive plan that is the basis for the bonuses awarded to Sweeney and other executives. (AFP)

    Biden cancels US$4.28bn more in student debt

<img alt="President Biden says he had promised to make higher education a ticket to the middle class. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784408_1_20241220203036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday he was cancelling student loans for an additional 55,000 Americans, which would amount to wiping out US$4.28 billion in debt in his final month in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mass cancellation of debt is for "teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials, and other public service workers who have dedicated their lives to giving back to their communities," he said in a statement issued by the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this new crop of beneficiaries, it would mean "nearly 5 million people" have been approved for debt relief during Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From Day One of my administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement that Friday's approval brings the total amount secured during Biden's four years in office to "nearly US$180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic president had instigated a landmark forgiveness programme in 2022 to cancel hundreds of billions in student debt – which would have made certain borrowers eligible to receive US$20,000 in cancellations, while the vast majority were eligible for US$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the conservative-dominated Supreme Court overruled the program in 2023, stating that given the large sum, the president had overstepped his powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, colleges can often cost anywhere between US$10,000 and US$70,000 a year, leaving some graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Pew Research Center, one in four American adults under 40 have student loan debt, with the median amount owed being between US$20,000 and US$25,000 in 2023, varying by education level. (AFP)

    Malaysia to resume search for missing MH370 plane

<img alt="Malaysia agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously 10 years ago. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784393_1_20241220183504.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's government has agreed in principle to accept a second “no find, no fee” proposal from a US company to renew the hunt for flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than 10 years ago, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Loke said cabinet ministers gave the nod at their meeting last week for Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to continue the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said the government will not be required to pay Ocean Infinity unless the plane's wreckage is discovered, under the same “no find, no fee” deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his ministry hopes to finalise negotiations for terms and conditions of the agreement with Ocean Infinity in early 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This decision reflects the government’s commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of MH370 passengers,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the the company had improved its technology since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and narrow the search area to the most likely site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 13 million passenger trips in and out of Hong Kong will take place over the Christmas and New Year holidays with the majority via land borders, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said about 11 million trips will likely be made through land boundary control points from Saturday to New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of departures via land is estimated to peak at 595,000 on Christmas Day and the inbound figure is likely to reach a high of 626,000 on December 29, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Border control points at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay are expected to be busy, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the [Immigration Department] has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said further details will be announced "as soon as possible" regarding government requests to extend the service hours of two border checkpoints on New Year's Eve.

    HA to beef up manpower ahead of winter flu surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Friday said it will beef up manpower and bed capacity to guard against a potential surge in patients during the upcoming holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported a mild increase in both Covid and influenza cases, with the numbers expected to rise further in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it will activate special measures for peak periods from Saturday, including reducing non-urgent hospital admissions and boosting manpower in public hospitals by 10 to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, told a press conference that he's confident public hospitals have enough capacity to cope with a surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important bit of it is to increase the bed turnover, including making use of our command centre and the day centre, so that we can aim our patients not lasting too long in our hospitals so that we can cater more emergency admissions," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to experience, our measures have improved and enhanced our capability to cope with the increased demand. So if the situations and the service activity will be similar to last year, I think we can cope with it."

  Lee said the HA will also relaunch a special refund arrangement at accident and emergency departments to ease the pressure on services. Patients who don't want to wait any longer to be seen can apply for a refund of the HK$180 fee within 24 hours of registration.

 A Macau-based academic on Friday said the SAR should think of ways to bring people to neighbouring Hengqin Island, which is partly leased to the territory, to diversify its economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a speech at the inauguration of the new Macau government, President Xi Jinping urged authorities not to deviate from the purpose of the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area offers support for Macau in diversifying its economy and developing four key industries: big health; innovation and technology; financial services; conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Hengqin] is highly developed, but it still lacks population," City University of Macau's rector Jun Liu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we really think about Hengqin as an expanded area, as a collaboration zone, we need to have people. We need to have policies to support four areas of economic diversification, we need to retain those highly qualified graduates... On the other hand, we really need to look elsewhere for great talent from around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor also said the new government under Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai is expected to take forward measures and initiatives, after the previous administration had laid the groundwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, it seems that we are [in] a better position to move forward with more vision, more hands-on strategies," Liu said.

    Police arrest 39 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty-nine people were arrested this week on suspicion of staging traffic accidents to try to defraud the government out of money granted to injured victims, police said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 48, are suspected of making false claims worth a total of HK$2 million in relation to 33 allegedly fake accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Earlier this year, an internal audit by the Social Welfare Department found fraudsters using falsified documents to apply for the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme," Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lim said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police investigations found some of these claims were linked to an organisation which orchestrates staged traffic accidents. One such incident involved 13 people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted that 275 people were arrested last month over suspicious claims under the scheme worth a total of HK$14 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said money was not paid out in relation to most of the suspicious claims connected to the latest arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said it verifies every application stringently and is carrying out more random checks on medical certificates submitted by applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If false medical information, fraudulence or other criminal elements are suspected, the SWD will refer the case to the police for investigation and recover the overpaid assistance payments from the relevant applicants," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also warned that people convicted of providing false information to obtain money from the accident victims scheme risk a jail term of up to 14 years.

    US govt shutdown looms as bill fails in Congress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spending bill backed by Donald Trump failed in the US House of Representatives on Thursday as dozens of Republicans defied the president-elect, leaving Congress with no clear plan to avert a fast-approaching government shutdown that could disrupt Christmas travel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote laid bare fault lines in Trump's Republican Party that could surface again next year when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had pressured lawmakers to tie up loose ends before he takes office on January 20, but members of the party's right flank refused to support a package that would increase spending and clear the way for a plan that would add trillions more to the federal government's US$36 trillion in debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible," said Republican Representative Chip Roy, one of 38 Republicans who voted against the bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package failed by a vote of 174-235 just hours after it was hastily assembled by Republican leaders seeking to comply with Trump's demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world's richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson provided no details when reporters asked him about next steps after the failed vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will come up with another solution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the US government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paychecks for more than two million federal workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Transportation Security Administration warned that travellers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill that failed on Thursday largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would have extended government funding into March and provided US$100 billion in disaster relief and suspended the debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Trump's urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years -- a move that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson before the vote told reporters that the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well," he said. (Reuters)

    Japan inspects US air base over chemical spill

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese authorities on Friday staged an inspection of a US military base in Tokyo, a government spokesman said, after being informed by the American side of a chemical leak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's probe at the Yokota Air Base followed a US notice two months ago that water containing PFOS -- classified by the World Health Organisation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" -- had spilled from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  PFOS is part of a large group of man-made chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called "forever chemicals" because they do not degrade easily, experts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military informed Tokyo in October that the PFOS-laced water had leaked from an area of the base where a fire-fighting drill was being carried out, Fumitoshi Sato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This inspection was realised in response to the fears and concerns harboured by local residents, and we will continue to work together with the US side," Sato said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including from the defence ministry and Tokyo's metropolitan government visited the site on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yokota Air Base was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's military presence in Japan has frequently stoked local discontent in the past, with everything from noise to pollution to helicopter accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  This frustration is perhaps most evident on the southern island of Okinawa, which despite comprising just 0.6 percent of Japan's landmass, hosts the vast majority of the country's US military bases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the United States began relocating thousands of Marines from Okinawa, with an initial "detachment of approximately 100 logistics support Marines" transferred to the US island territory of Guam. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday directed Macau to diversity its economy as one of his four “hopes” for its new administration, after swearing in the SAR’s new Chief Executive, Sam Hou-fai.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president expressed confidence the SAR will open up new horizons for development and keep creating new glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland, Xi also laid out his expectations for the government to improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China’s connections with the international community, and safeguard social harmony and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president urged the gambling hub to cultivate new industries in alignment with China's national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present the overall situation in Macau is stable, but the internal and external environment is undergoing profound changes," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Efforts should be made to promote moderate economic diversification... [with a] focus on cultivating new industries with international competitiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi also highlighted the importance of Hengqin Island, which was partly leased to Macau to boost its land supply for non-gaming development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government decided to develop Hengqin with the goal of fostering Macau's development of a diversified economy and to facilitate the living and employment of Macau residents," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There can be no development of industries and projects that do not align with this positioning."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the crucial role that the One Country, Two Systems model has played in ensuring the city’s success in the past 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's splendid achievements since its return to the motherland is proof to the world that 'One Country, Two Systems' has a clear systemic advantage and strong vitality," Xi said, adding that the framework "must be adhered to over the long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that young people in the city should continue to build on the successes of One Country, Two Systems, and urged authorities to help nurture the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The SAR government and all sectors in society should care more about them and help them develop, and create a better environment and conditions for them,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope all young people will care about Macau and the country, set lofty goals, be pragmatic, and fulfil the role of builders and successors of the cause of One Country Two Systems.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Macau has been shining like a “bright pearl” and that its people have benefitted from its economic and social development over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sense of gain, happiness and security of Macau residents have strengthened significantly,” Xi said. (Additional reporting by agencies)

    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK that the city's drivers are familiar with having variable message boards on highways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [drivers] are already used to the notice board and the electronic notice on the highway. But I've noticed many times the government puts on some road safety message instead of the road information on the spot. They should inform motorists of the real-time information on the highway instead of just a road safety message," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan also said the one-month trial period may be too short for data to be collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the government] spent a lot of time to install the system for this trial. So my question is, why just a one month trial? If we are lucky that there's no accident happening during this month, then we'll have no data. So I think the trial, with all this preparation work, the trial should be longer," he said.

 Sam Hou-fai was on Friday sworn in as Macau's chief executive in an inauguration ceremony officiated by President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new Macau CE's oath was administered by the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his inauguration speech, Sam said he “felt honoured of taking the great responsibility” of being the SAR’s leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed to lead the new administration to unite all sectors of the community, and to fully, faithfully and resolutely implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam stated that he and his governance team would bear President Xi's speech in mind and take on the great responsibility of leading the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will make every effort in making Macau as a city with rule of law, vitality, culture and happiness,” Sam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the solid backing of our country, and the united efforts of our citizens, we are confident and capable of making greater achievements [under] One Country, Two Systems. We will make Macau, which is ‘a pearl on the nation's palm', be brighter,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam also said in safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and development interests, his administration would continue to strengthen patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new CE added he would improve efficiency and governance to provide more convenient services to citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam said he appreciated the country's support and the efforts of the three former Macau chief executives.

    Wolves appoint Vitor Pereira as new head coach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wolverhampton Wanderers announced Thursday they had appointed Vitor Pereira as their new head coach as they battle for Premier League survival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old Portuguese manager has left Saudi Pro League club Al Shabab to join Wolves on an 18-month contract after the Midlands side, battling to avoid relegation, sacked Gary O'Neil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely travelled Pereira was close to replacing Rafael Benitez as Everton manager in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an extensive managerial career, Pereira has won two Primeira Liga titles with Porto and the Greek Super League with Olympiakos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported Tuesday that Wolves would pay around US$1 million to bring Pereira to the English top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to welcome Vitor Pereira to Wolves as the new head coach of our men's first-team," Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Vitor is a highly respected and experienced coach who has achieved success across different leagues, and will bring a new approach for the test ahead," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a challenging moment for the club, and we want to thank Vitor for taking on this responsibility. We have full confidence in his ability to guide us back on track, alongside the players and staff, and the entire club will be united in supporting him to achieve success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves, second bottom in the Premier League, said Pereira took his first training session with the club on Thursday and would be in charge for their match away to fellow relegation candidates Leicester – five points above them in the standings – on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was sacked after Saturday's 2-1 loss at home to Ipswich, the club's fourth defeat in a row, left Wolves with just nine points from 16 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was appointed in August 2023, following the departure of Julen Lopetegui and signed a new four-year deal with the club in August this year. (AFP)

    US-based Friedkin Group completes Everton takeover

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US-based Friedkin Group has completed the takeover of Premier League strugglers Everton, ending a turbulent period for the club under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri.
 <br>
  <br>
  Everton have been acquired by Roundhouse Capital Holdings Limited, an entity within the Friedkin Group (TFG), the club announced on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League said TFG had purchased a 98.8 percent stake in Everton, which becomes the 10th English top-flight club under majority American ownership – a list that includes Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in September that TFG had agreed to buy Moshiri's majority stake subject to regulatory approval, which has now been granted by the Premier League, Women's Professional Leagues Limited, the Football Association and the Financial Conduct Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported that TFG's deal to buy Everton was worth more than US$500 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Texas-based group is led by chairman Dan Friedkin and also owns Italian Serie A club Roma. Friedkin has a net worth of US$7.7 billion, according to Forbes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take immense pride in welcoming one of England's most historic football clubs to our global family, the Friedkin Group," Friedkin said in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming executive chairman Marc Watts said "providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority".
  <br>
  <br>
  "While restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Iranian businessman Moshiri, who bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016, welcomed the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I truly believe that the transaction with the Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  American investment firm 777 Partners were unable to complete a deal earlier this year while John Textor, who has a share in Crystal Palace, had previously been in the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have twice been sanctioned under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules in the past 13 months, and had eight points in total deducted last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club have been ever present in the English top flight for the past 70 years but have flirted with relegation in recent seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are currently 16th in the Premier League table, just three points above the relegation zone.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Thursday as Treasury bond yields climbed further in the wake of a Federal Reserve decision that prompted deep selling in the prior session.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices bounced early in the day, but the rebound faded as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates but signaled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 percent to 42,342.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,867.08, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.1 percent to 19,372.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's move in stocks is "kind of a lacklustre recovery effort," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of good news has been priced into this market," he said. "And now the market is going to sit back and see if a lot of that good news that's priced in actually comes to fruition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were monitoring Capitol Hill where an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump on a spending bill raised the possibility of a government shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Micron Technology sank 16.2 percent after projecting earnings that lagged estimates. While the chip company benefited from strong demand for artificial intelligence, analysts pointed to a drag from weak demand for personal computers and automobile clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden and other chains, jumped 14.7 percent after projecting a 1.5 percent rise in same-restaurant sales for its full fiscal year. (AFP)

    Putin: Russia closer to achieving goals in Ukraine

<img alt="During his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield in Ukraine, and touted what he said was the invincibility of Russia's new hypersonic missile.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I must say that the situation is changing dramatically... There is movement along the entire front line. Every day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Western and Russian military analysts say Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine at the fastest pace since 2022, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our fighters are reclaiming territory by the square kilometre every day," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the fighting was complex, so it was "difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is fighting, literally heroically. And they are fighting right now. Let us wish them all...good luck, victory and to return home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the "Oreshnik" hypersonic missile which Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no chance of shooting down these missiles," said Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let Western experts propose to us, and let them propose to those in the West and the U.S. who pay them for their analysis, to conduct some kind of technological experiment, say, a high-tech duel of the 21st century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?" he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

 President Xi Jinping has called on Macau to better integrate into the country's strategic development and continue to strive for more, saying the SAR has what it takes to "fly high".
 <br>
  <br>
  Stating his three expectations on Thursday, the president urged the city to align with the motherland's developments; to gather people who safeguard One Country, Two Systems and love Macau; and to undergo reforms and innovate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Macau] must keep an eye on the overall strategies of the rejuvenation of the Chinese civilisation and changes in the world," Xi addressed a dinner reception celebrating the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should keep up with the trend of the times, further find its own positioning, plan for the future development of Macau, be more proactive in aligning with national development strategies such as the Greater Bay Area, and make greater achievements on the international stage," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president praised the outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and his administration, saying the past five years had been "extraordinary" in the city's history, navigating constant changes in the world and challenges presented by the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support of the central government and the motherland, Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and the fifth-term government have united and led all sectors of Macau to overcome difficulties, and to be pragmatic," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They] have promoted the continued improvement of the economy, with various undertakings making comprehensive progress and writing a new chapter in the successful implementation of One Country, Two Systems with Macau characteristics."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, for his part, told the crowd that his administration had implemented the principle of "patriots governing Macau", safeguarded national security, promoted moderate economic diversification, improved governance, and better integrated into the nation's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The motherland is the strongest backing for Macau's prosperity and stability. The country has always regarded Macau as its 'crown jewel', cared about the well-being of compatriots, continued to introduce a series of policies and measures beneficial to Macau, and constantly provided new opportunities, space and motivation for Macau's development," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Xi and the central government for their trust and support, while giving his backing for his successor Sam Hou-fai in leading the new government and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president and the guests were then treated to a gala show featuring musical performances, dances, acrobatics among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The congregation joined Xi in singing "Ode to the Motherland", wrapping up the hour-long event on a high note.

    Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband found guilty in rape trial

<img alt="Gisèle Pelicot at the courthouse to hear the verdict in the trial of her ex-husband, with 50 others, who were found guilty of drugging her and orchestrating multiple rapes over nearly a decade.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Thursday sentenced Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband to the maximum term of 20 years jail for committing and orchestrating the mass rapes targeting her with dozens of strangers he recruited online.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot, who had already confessed to the crimes, was earlier found guilty by the court in the southern city of Avignon after a more than three-month trial that shocked France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including Dominique Pelicot, all 51 defendants in the case were convicted by the court with no acquittals.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 50 co-defendants received jail terms of between three and 15 years -- less than what prosecutors had demanded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of these defendants had their jail terms suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pelicot, the now ex-husband of the 72-year-old grandmother, admitted that for years he knocked his wife of 50 years out with drugs so he and strangers he recruited online could abuse and rape her while he filmed the assaults.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appalling ordeal inflicted over nearly a decade on Gisèle Pelicot, in what she thought was a loving marriage, and her courage during the bruising and stunning trial have transformed the retired power company worker into a feminist hero of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stretching over more than three months, the trial galvanised campaigners against sexual violence and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had arrested 22 people and seized drugs worth over HK$160 million in a series of airport operations ahead of the Christmas holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said around 370 kilos of drugs were seized from November to mid-December, including ketamine, methamphetamine and space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffickers made use of festive decorations to hide the drugs before the holiday season, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the long holiday season at year-end, drug traffickers usually take the opportunity to smuggle drugs to the local market," said Wong Ngar-shan, acting divisional commander of Customs' airport investigation group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, Hong Kong Customs has adjusted its enforcement strategies accordingly, successfully intercepting cannabis from North America and Thailand, ketamine from Europe, and methamphetamine from North America from entering the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also said they seized 18 kilos of etomidate powder shipped from India, which can be used to make around 54,000 space oil-infused capsules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, space oil usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to add etomidate to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance by the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers will get the chance to travel on panda-themed trains from Thursday, as part of a wider campaign to welcome the city’s four new pandas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The corporation is one of the many businesses joining the “Come and Enjoy a Pandastic Hong Kong” campaign, organised by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Hong Kong Tourism Board and Ocean Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two trains on the South Island Line and one Airport Express train have been decorated with pandas and will commence service on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  “December is the month of the pandas. If we read the news in the last few days we see there’s a lot of new attractions rolled out to celebrate or to share the joy of the pandas with the public,” MTR managing director Jeny Yeung told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So MTR is also launching a series of activities and decorations in our trains so that when our passengers are going to different destinations including when they are visiting the pandas they can have a very joyful experience,” she said
  <br>
  <br>
  People will also be able to see panda decorations at Ocean Park Station and at Admiralty Station, where LED pillars with 3D animations of a giant panda waving its arms will also greet passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Lo Wu Station, Lok Ma Chau Station, West Kowloon Station, as well as stations along the South Island Line and Airport Express, MTR staff will be attaching panda plushies to their uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The campaign will run until mid-February.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of intense Israeli airstrikes shook Yemen's rebel-held capital and a port city early on Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s strikes risk further escalating conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis, whose attacks on the Red Sea corridor have drastically impacted global shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which backs the group, denounced the raids as a "flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's raids came after it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have regularly targeted Israel over its military operation in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it "conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen -- including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organisation: Israel's long arm will reach you too," Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Masira, a media channel belonging to the Houthis, said a series of "aggressive raids" were launched in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  It reported raids that "targeted two central power plants" in and around Yemen's capital Sanaa, while in Hodeidah it said "the enemy launched four aggressive raids targeting the port... and two raids targeting" an oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said strikes on the Al-Saleef port had killed seven people, while two more were killed and other injured in the strike on the oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes came after Israel's military intercepted a missile from Yemen for the second time this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Houthis claimed a missile launch they said was aimed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy in the occupied area of Yaffa" -- a reference to Israel's Tel Aviv area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also Monday, an Israeli navy missile boat intercepted a drone in the Mediterranean after it was launched from Yemen, the military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have said they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians and pledged Monday to continue operations "until the aggression on Gaza stops and the siege is lifted".
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 9, a drone claimed by Houthis exploded on the top floor of a residential building in the central Israel city of Yavne, causing no casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a Houthi drone attack in Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting retaliatory strikes on the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have also regularly targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets by United States and sometimes British forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the group had become a "global threat," pointing to Iran's support for the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to act against anyone, anyone in the Middle East, that threatens the state of Israel," he said. (Agencies)

 A recent survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service has found that half of drug users wait years before seeking help, and many downplay the negative effects of drug abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The organisation polled 304 drug users between September and November, and found that 55 percent only sought treatment after using drugs for more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 40 percent claimed that drug use had no negative impact on their lives, and the youngest drug abuser was just nine years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Ng, the group’s service supervisor, said people might be reluctant to seek help because of the stigma associated with drug use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sometimes it's a health issue. They cannot find any health issue in their body, or maybe they were not aware of the mental illness issue. The second point is they don't want to [publicly tell] their story,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also found that around nine percent of respondents reported using "space oil" - a regulated sedative typically inhaled through vapes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Dr Matthew Wong said long-term use of space oil could cause irreversible damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When someone is using the drug repeatedly and also receiving a high dose, that will cause damage in the brain cells and also cause some irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will bring all sorts of physical and mental problems the patient would be suffering from.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for more prevention education in schools and more accessible support channels to help people tackle drug addiction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping visited the Macau University of Science and Technology on Thursday morning on the second day of his trip marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi’s motorcade arrived at the university before 10am amid tight security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president toured two state-level laboratories at the university, one in traditional Chinese medicine and the other in lunar and planetary science.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had exchanges with faculty, researchers and students, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  University president Joseph Lee quoted Xi as saying Macau could work with the mainland in areas such as Chinese medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xi] believes the research for Chinese medicine should be combined with the latest biomedicine to lead the world, and that Chinese medicine will take up a very important position in the world," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the president noted the achievements of the Macau Science 1, a low-latitude satellite constellation with high-precision geomagnetic field measurements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong Chi-meng, Macau's director of education and youth development, said Xi was satisfied with the development of higher education in the SAR and praised the territory's patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi had warm exchanges with residents living and starting businesses in the cooperation zone, and with people involved in the zone's planning, construction, management and services, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is expected to visit other places in Macau this afternoon and attend a gala dinner and a variety show in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday morning, a museum near the Ruínas de São Paulo welcomed First Lady Peng Liyuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng spent around an hour at the museum and met a group of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Peng] urged the kids to study history and culture well, so that they could better understand their own place and offer help in the future," said Macau's culture chief Leong Wai-man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will lead a delegation to Macau to attend the celebration events today.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan and Justice Secretary Paul Lam will be among those joining Lee on the visit.

    Arson suspected in deadly karaoke fire in Hanoi

<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire ripped through a karaoke bar in the Vietnamese capital, killing 11 people and injuring two others in a case of suspected arson, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pictures on state media showed the blackened multi-storey building in western Hanoi, mostly destroyed by flames, and piles of twisted metal strewn nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received reports of a fire at 11pm on Wednesday "with many people trapped inside".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers rushed to the scene and managed to bring out seven people alive, two of whom were rushed to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven others were found dead, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police suspect that the cafe was (deliberately) burned down and... have arrested the perpetrator," Hanoi police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told state media the fire was so large that no one dared to attempt to rescue those trapped inside. Photos from the scene showed that the building's balconies were enclosed with metal bars, likely making escape difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nguyen Minh Hung, who was nearby at the time, told the Dan Tri newspaper: "We were shouting for the trapped victims, but we heard no ask for help from inside the building."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 fire trucks and ambulances sped to the scene, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire reportedly began on the first floor, before quickly spreading through the building. State media said CCTV footage from a nearby house showed a man carrying a bucket entering the premises shortly before the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspect was arrested around midnight, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had gone to the karaoke bar to drink beer before arguing with staff, they added. He then allegedly bought petrol and poured it close to an area with many motorbikes, which burst into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident comes after six people, including four police officers, were jailed in October over a fire that ripped through a karaoke bar two years ago, killing 32 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze in a province close to business hub Ho Chi Minh City shocked Vietnam and led to the closure of thousands of karaoke bars nationwide for failing to meet fire regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the country's approximately 15,000 karaoke bars were forced to close, according to state media, citing police sources. (AFP)

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Mayotte on Thursday, his office said, as officials warned the death toll from the most destructive cyclone in living memory could reach hundreds - possibly thousands.
 <br>
  <br>
  France has declared "exceptional natural disaster" measures for Mayotte as authorities grapple with the full scale of the devastation wrought by Cyclone Chido on the Indian Ocean archipelago, racing against time to search for survivors and supply aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" measures, announced by French overseas minister Francois-Noel Buffet on social media platform X, will ensure "faster and more effective management of the crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers raced on Wednesday to find survivors in the ruins of shanty towns while also unblocking roads and clearing rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulldozers were clearing the heliport of the island's only hospital, as residents were busy repairing their metal-sheet huts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Located near Madagascar off the coast of southeastern Africa, Mayotte is France's poorest region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A preliminary toll from France's interior ministry shows that 31 people have been confirmed killed, 45 seriously wounded and 1,373 suffering lighter injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials say the toll could rise exponentially. (AFP)

    US Supreme Court agrees to hear TikTok's appeal

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton, while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rare goals from Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Núñez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Núñez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliott doubled Liverpool in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game, after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN envoy to Syria called on Wednesday for "free and fair" elections after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad, voicing hope for a political solution for Kurdish-held areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria following a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), more than 13 years after his crackdown on democracy protests precipitated one of the deadliest wars of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  He left behind a country scarred by decades of torture, disappearances and summary executions, and the collapse of his rule on December 8 stunned the world and sparked celebrations around Syria and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of civil war have also left the country heavily dependent on aid, deeply fragmented and desperate for justice and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing reporters in Damascus, UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said "there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new Syria that... will adopt a new constitution... and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes, after a transitional period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling for immediate humanitarian assistance, he also said he hoped to see an end to international sanctions levied against Syria over Assad's abuses. (AFP)

    Pérez, Red Bull part ways after season of struggles

<img alt="Red Bull's Sergio Pérez at the qualifying session of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784099_1_20241219064142.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull announced Wednesday that under-pressure Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has departed the Formula One outfit after four seasons, with Liam Lawson tipped to become world champion Max Verstappen's new teammate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pérez, 34, joined Red Bull in 2021 and helped the team earn two constructors' titles and completed a drivers' standings one-two with four-time world champion Verstappen in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won five Grands Prix over 90 starts in Red Bull colours, including a victory at the Monaco GP and a double in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 season, Pérez and Red Bull signed a contract extension, tying the pair together until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Guadalajara-native's form dropped drastically after that deal and he picked up just nine points from his final eight race weekends.
  <br>
  <br>
  This dip in form led to rumours about his future in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came eighth in the drivers' standings as Red Bull surrendered their team title to McLaren with a third-placed finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pérez was adamant during his difficult period that he would stay with the team for next season but he will now part ways with Red Bull with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Pérez said. "Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together."
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran will not have a seat on the grid next season, but it remains to be seen whether he will sign a deal elsewhere for 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We'll meet again soon. And remember – never give up," Pérez added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen hailed his former teammate on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an absolute pleasure driving alongside you", the Dutchman wrote. "We've had some amazing moments together that I'll always remember. Thank you, Checo [Pérez]!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull said that "announcements regarding the team's full 2025 line-up will be made in due course".
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealander Lawson, who currently drives for Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls, is considered the favourite to replace Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old has earned three top-10 finishes so far in his fledgling F1 career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank Checo for all he has done for Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first 1-2 finish in the drivers' championship," the statement went on to read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo." (AFP)

    Real Madrid sink Pachuca to claim Intercontinental Cup

<img alt="Real Madrid on the pitch after winning the Intercontinental Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784093_1_20241219053405.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  France striker Mbappé returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the Fifa Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for Concacaf Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vázquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is Madrid's second title of the season following their Uefa Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Muñoz for the most in club history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased, very happy. It's a success – that's more than anyone else," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the first edition of the Fifa-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year. They will return to the Middle East in early January for the four-team Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble as Fed eyes fewer 2025 rate cuts

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive after the Federal Reserve indicated fewer rate cuts next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784092_1_20241219053202.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates but also slashed the number of 2025 rate cuts in its forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly lower after the Fed projected just two interest rate cuts next year, down from four.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow slid 2.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, to 42,326.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 3.0 percent to 5,872, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.6 percent to 19,392.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seeing the kind of decline we are experiencing right now indicates that the Fed took the market quite by surprise," said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although stocks often enjoy a late-year bounce referred to as the "Santa Claus rally," Stovall said the depth of Wednesday's drop could spur more selling if traders take profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe Santa is already on vacation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank, as expected, moved ahead with a decision to reduce interest rates by a quarter point as Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered an upbeat appraisal of the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the announcement was coupled with the altered outlook on 2025 monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the latest interest rate cut, the Fed is now "significantly closer" to the point where no further cuts will be needed, said Powell, who emphasised the central bank still views two percent inflation as a critical long-term priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's reaction suggests the investors are "grappling" with the likelihood that interest rates "for all intents and purposes, are going to remain higher for longer," said Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's losses were broad-based with 29 of 30 companies in the Dow ending lower and all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finishing in the red. (AFP)

    CATL co-develops EV models with swappable batteries

<img alt="The hope is that the choco-swap battery swapping stations will use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784064_1_20241218212714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CATL said on Wednesday it had co-developed 10 new electric vehicle models with automakers that use swappable batteries, as the Chinese battery giant seeks to lead a trend it says will replace a third of petrol stations in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yang Jun, CEO of CATL's battery swapping brand Evogo, said it would roll out the first EV that uses its so-called "choco-swap" battery this month, with the remaining to be launched in upcoming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL will also look to build 1,000 battery swapping stations next year and to accelerate this further by enlisting partners to build more stations, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's largest battery maker has also been seeking to expand in new business sectors such as micro power grids and skateboard chassis, CATL's chairman Robin Zeng told Reuters in an interview in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the Evogo battery swap service in 2022, which it said would allow drivers to change EV batteries in one minute. Its automaker partners include state-owned Changan Auto and FAW and to date it has built a small number of charging stations across a few Chinese cities on a trial basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription fee for the choco-swap battery swapping service starts from 369 yuan (US$51) per month, Yang said at an event in China's southern city of Xiamen to talk about battery swapping. Zeng told the same event that the batteries would come with two standard sizes to speed up adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope, Zeng added, was that the choco-swap battery swapping stations would use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  China could eventually have 30,000-40,000 battery swapping stations which could replace a third of its roughly 100,000 petrol stations, Yang predicted. Zeng said that he expected battery swapping to make up a third of power-up solutions for EVs alongside home and public chargers by 2030. (Reuters)

<img alt="This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784091_1_20241219051243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, amid uncertainty about inflation and President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers voted 11-to-1 to lower the US central bank's key lending rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In updated economic forecasts, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee pencilled in just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of four, and hiked their inflation outlook for next year, from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed has made progress in tackling inflation through interest rate hikes in the last two years, and recently began paring back rates to boost demand in the economy and support the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent, and raising concerns that the US central bank's battle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump, whose economic proposals include tariff hikes and the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  These plans, combined with the recent uptick in inflation data, led some analysts to pare back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 ahead of Wednesday's meeting, predicting that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

<img alt="A British court has ruled that Andrew Tate (left) and his brother Tristan (right) can have their assets seized to pay millions in back taxes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British court ruled Wednesday that police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds (US$3.3 million) to cover years of unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost US$12 million into an account in the name of J, were a “straightforward cheat” of the tax authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the force said that the Tates were “serial” tax evaders who failed to pay any tax on 21 million pounds in revenue from their online businesses, including War Room, Hustlers’ University, Cobra Tate and OnlyFans, between 2014 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate, 38, accused the government of “outright theft” for freezing his accounts and seizing “everything they could.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is not justice; it’s a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system," Tate said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This raises serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hearing in July, attorney Sarah Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: “When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said J — who can't be named because of a court order — wasn't involved with the brothers' businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the brothers, Martin Evans, argued that the bank transfers were “entirely orthodox” for people who run online businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the siblings spent money on a number of “exotic motor cars,” but did nothing illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer and dual British-US citizen who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and Tristan Tate, 36, face criminal allegations in Romania , including human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are set to be extradited to the UK once those proceedings are over to face further allegations of rape and human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tates deny all the allegations. (AP)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday greeted members of the public as he visited a panda carnival in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee visited several stalls at the fair, chatted with their operators as well as passers-by, took selfies with them and bought 38 panda dolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also went to a bar, had a drink and talked to a customer from Sweden who was in Hong Kong to develop her design business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have long stays. We have short stays. That's Hong Kong. In fact, this is the world. Looking around, people are so mobile, so they tend to really float around. It's a global village," Lee told the Swedish visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I'm very glad to see that you are bringing Swedish culture [to the city]. That is what Hong Kong people love - to try everything. They appreciate the different characteristics of different countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Lee's second district visit in a week.

    Kai Tak Sports Park preps for first concert

<img alt="Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784025_2_20241218170246.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowd control and set-up procedures are just a few of the measures that authorities will be taking note of, as Kai Tak Arena prepares for its inaugural concert on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said around 5,500 ticket holders are expected to attend the Chill Thai Music Festival, featuring local boy band Mirror.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4.30pm, with the performance set to start at 6.30pm and wrap up before 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said the arrangements for sporting events and concerts differ significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For concert events, it involves more set-ups, the stage arrangement, which we do not have during the sports events. There's also rehearsals that we are going to test for a concert event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the above, the spectators' arrival and dispersal patterns of concert events are quite different from typical sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said concert goers should have already gotten their tickets in advance, adding that there will be no on-site ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the ticketing arrangements for these concerts, they are all distributed through the events organisers, so participants and spectators should have got their tickets by now. They are not required to get their tickets on site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this arrangement would ensure orderly pedestrian flow during the concerts and during the starting time of the concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reminded attendees that umbrellas, outside food and drink, water bottles, professional photography equipment, and support signs larger than 38cm long, 20cm wide and 30cm high are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added these restrictions align with those at concerts held at AsiaWorld-Expo and the Hong Kong Coliseum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday, featuring a sports recreation facility and around 200 shops with over 80 percent leased.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Wong, head of retail at Kai Tak Sports Park, said the mall would discuss flexible operating hours with merchants during major events and performances, adding the mall can maintain a steady flow of visitors before and after shows and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mall allows customers to come earlier to shop and enjoy meals. They don't have to come last minute just for their event. It's to give people more diverse options and creates a better experience," she said.

    Japanese startup's space rocket launch fails

<img alt="Japan's Space One's small, solid-fueled Kairos rocket lifts off at Space One's launching pad on the tip of Kii peninsula in Kushimoto town, Wakayama prefecture. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784026_1_20241218170424.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Space One terminated the flight of its Kairos small rocket shortly after liftoff on Wednesday, marking the end of its second attempt in nine months to become the country's first company to deliver a satellite to space with a privately-developed rocket.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the latest in a series of recent setbacks for Japanese rocket development, even as the government pushes for 30 rocket launches annually and an 8 trillion yen (US$52 billion) space industry by the early 2030s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kairos rocket self-destructed about three minutes into the flight, after it detected abnormalities in the first-stage engine nozzle control and the rocket's trajectory, Space One director Mamoru Endo said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live images from the local Wakayama prefecture government had shown the 18-metre solid-propellant rocket blasting off from Spaceport Kii in western Japan at 11am, but whirling during its ascent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the failure remains unclear and requires further investigation, Endo said, adding that Kairos probably flew to an altitude of more than 100 kilometres until the self-destruct system kicked in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five small satellites were on board the rocket, which was headed into sun-synchronous orbit roughly 500 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-based Space One was founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, IHI's aerospace unit, construction firm Shimizu and a state-backed bank, with the goal of launching 20 small rockets a year by 2029 to capture growing satellite launch demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  At its debut flight in March, Kairos, carrying a Japanese government satellite, exploded five seconds after launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inappropriate flight settings triggered the rocket's autonomous self-destruct system even though no issues were found in its hardware, Space One later said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't see what happened this time as a failure," company president Masakazu Toyoda told reporters on Wednesday, repeating the phrase he used in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the data from the failed launch would be useful for a third mission and that another attempt was on the cards. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok on Wednesday urged young athletes and their parents to remain vigilant when signing contracts with sports bodies.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the family of a young skateboarder successfully terminated a contract with a local association for the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It claimed to be able to nominate the athlete to compete in international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chairman of the association told me that he had the authorisation to nominate my daughter to participate in the Asian Games and even the Olympic Games. Everything went through a phone call, but this is the main reason why I signed the contract without deep thinking," the athlete's father surnamed Su said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Su signed the five-year contract back in 2021. However, no regular training was provided for his daughter, and he was asked to pay more than HK$100,000 for training and enter competitions that anyone could sign up for themselves. He said he never received any receipts regarding his payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Su expressed his wish to terminate the contract this February, the sports body raised harsh conditions on his daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They demanded us to either pay HK$300,000 as a termination fee, or my daughter [would] not [be] involved in any skateboarding activity in a year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A termination agreement was made in July after lawyers got involved in the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said parents can refer to membership information under sports associations to verify the authenticity of various sports bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If in doubt, [parents] can contact SF&OC (Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China) or responsible national sports associations, to inquire more about the association or entity that you are involved with, to make sure that they are promoting the sports in a positive way, and not making any alternative claims that may not meet their expectation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome different sports entities, stakeholders to contribute to sports in Hong Kong. Everyone has a right to push sports. But if such organisations are making claims, do double check and stay alert," he added.

 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Wednesday shot down a lawmaker's suggestion that people fined for carrying out large-scale unauthorised building works be allowed to keep them if they aren't considered dangerous.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping lawmakers will agree to amend the Buildings Ordinance. Under its proposal, the maximum fine for unauthorised building projects will go up from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco development panel meeting, legislator Wendy Hong asked whether people could be exempt from demolishing or rectifying large-scale illegal structures that do not pose any danger after they pay the fine.

  <br>
  Linn said the government does not want to "go down such a route" or mislead future generations into thinking they can "pay to break the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also difficult to guarantee the long-term structural integrity of the works, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A professional may be able to inspect it (unauthorised building works) with the naked eye and say that it is safe, but don't forget that at the time of construction, no building plan was submitted and probably they didn't have any construction records," Linn explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the meeting, Linn also reassured owners' corporations that they will not be prosecuted immediately after being served a notice to carry out mandatory building inspection, as long as they begin to take action.

 The government said on Wednesday that 25 people have been arrested over the past three years on suspicion of using fake qualifications to apply for places at tertiary institutions in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charges were laid against eight of them, with three convictions and five people on bail pending trial. The rest of the cases are still under investigation, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, lawmakers said many mainland intermediaries claim they can guarantee university admissions, as well as successful entry to Hong Kong through different talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung asked whether the government has enough manpower to conduct checks on admissions, noting that some of those who moved to Hong Kong through the talent programmes are due to have their visas renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting security minister Michael Cheuk said in response that officers will step up inspections, adding that the authorities have been working closely with their mainland counterparts and that they conduct joint enforcement action in a timely manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As at 10 December 2024, the police had referred information of a total of 14 mainland intermediary agencies or intermediaries to the relevant mainland authorities for follow-up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In respect of the recent cases involving false proof and unscrupulous intermediaries, the Immigration Department has been maintaining close communication and exchanging intelligence with the relevant mainland authorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also stressed that the Education Bureau has told tertiary institutions to adopt enhanced measures, such as requiring applicants to submit third-party verification proof before admission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Macau for a three-day visit marking the 25th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking upon his arrival at the airport, Xi hailed Macau's development since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, the One Country, Two Systems principle with unique Macau characteristics has achieved worldwide recognition, showcasing vibrancy and unique charm," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The country's development is rapidly advancing, and its momentum cannot be stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's vast development potential is being unleashed, and the future is promising. This is the pride of Macau residents and the pride for the entire nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that Macau has a bright future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe as long as [Macau] gives full play to the advantages of One Country, Two Systems and is not afraid to strive and innovate, it can definitely create a better tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau is a jewel in China's crown, and I always have its development and the well-being of all its residents in my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and First Lady Peng Liyuan were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as their plane landed at Macau International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will oversee the inauguration of the SAR's new leader, Sam Hou-fai, and other members of his governing team on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also conduct an inspection tour and attend a gala dinner and a variety performance, among other activities, during his stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is Xi's third visit to Macau as president, after 2014 and 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will travel to the gaming hub on Thursday to take part in the anniversary events there.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has detained an Uzbek citizen who investigators believe placed the bomb which killed General Igor Kirillov on the instructions of Ukraine's security service, Moscow's Investigative Committee said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A national of Uzbekistan, born in 1995, was arrested on suspicion of having committed the attack that cost the life of the commander of Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, Igor Kirillov, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov", the Investigative Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man said he had been "recruited by Ukrainian special forces", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov and his assistant were killed on Tuesday as they walked out of a Moscow apartment building early in the morning, after an explosive device attached to a scooter went off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the suspect told interrogators that he had come to Moscow to carry out the attack and that a camera mounted on the dashboard of a rented car parked outside the building had filmed the attack and streamed it "live to the attack organisers, in the (Ukrainian) city of Dnipro".
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was promised US$100,000 to carry out the attack, as well as the possibility to settle "in a European country", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov was the most senior military figure assassinated in Russia since the conflict with Ukraine began nearly three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian army's chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit and was recently sanctioned by Britain over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. (Agencies)

<img alt="Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are in preliminary merger talks as a way to deal with the growing competition to their business from EVs. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784003_1_20241218151346.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Honda and Nissan are in talks to deepen ties, media reports said on Wednesday, including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of how Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  A combined Honda and Nissan would create a US$54 billion company with annual output of 7.4 million vehicles, making it the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two firms had already forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan's deepening financial and strategic trouble in recent months has added more urgency for closer cooperation with larger rival Honda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan announced a US$2.6 billion cost savings plan last month that includes cutting 9,000 jobs and 20 percent of its global production capacity, as slumping sales in China and the US led to a 85 percent plunge in second-quarter profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but Honda itself is not resting on its laurels," said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at Itochu Research Institute. "Honda's cash flow is set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven't been going so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nissan closed nearly 24 percent higher in Tokyo trade on Wednesday, while shares of Honda, whose market value of US$43 billion is more than four times bigger than that of Nissan, declined three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Mitsubishi gained nearly 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automakers have been grappling with challenges from EV makers, particularly in China, where BYD and others have surged ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Honda and Nissan, first reported by the Nikkei newspaper, would allow the companies to cooperate more on technology and help them create a more formidable domestic rival to Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discussions are focused on finding ways to bolster collaboration and include the possibility of setting up a holding company, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies are also discussing the possibility of full merger, according to one of the people, as well as looking at ways to cooperate with Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi said no deal had been announced by any of the companies, though Nissan and Mitsubishi noted the three automakers had said previously they were considering opportunities for future collaboration.
  <br>
  <br>
  French automaker Renault, a major Nissan shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three Japanese automakers are expected to hold a joint news conference in Tokyo on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Reuters)

    Sports events get priority for HK Coliseum, says govt

<img alt="The government says the Hong Kong Coliseum has been in full use in recent years. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783986_1_20241218135336.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the sports sector gets priority when it comes to booking the Hong Kong Coliseum, after a lawmaker complained that organisers turned away are instead taking their events to Macau or Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho noted that the Coliseum is also in high demand for concerts, arts and cultural events and said some in these sectors aren't sure why they find it hard to secure the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to his questions, culture and sports minister Rosanna Law said 461 booking applications – around 80 percent of the total received – have been rejected since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that throughout this period, the venue has been in constant use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of the successful bookings were for concerts, while around a fifth were for large-scale sporting events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Leisure and Cultural Services Department] considers the nature, significance and attraction of the events, audience appeal of the performers and booking history of the applicants, et cetera, when more than one organisation applies for the same time slot," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the Coliseum is regarded as an important sports venue and events in this category therefore get priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she expects event organisers will welcome the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park next year, and officials will work with the operator to promote the site for local and international events.

    Giannis stars as Bucks beat Thunder to win NBA Cup

<img alt="Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with a triple-double in the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783979_1_20241218123712.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks silenced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second half to win the second edition of the NBA Cup with a 97-81 victory in Las Vegas on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo delivered a triple-double of 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists along with two steals and three blocked shots for the Bucks, who drilled 17 three-pointers to complete an unbeaten run and follow in the footsteps of the Los Angeles Lakers as in-season tournament champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard scored 23 points for the Bucks, who held the potentially explosive Thunder offense to 31 points in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's who we are," Antetokounmpo said of the Bucks' second-half surge, which saw them push a one-point lead at halftime to as many as 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points and Jalen Williams added 18 but, with the Bucks thwarting them inside, Oklahoma City were ultimately doomed by their poor long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The triumph was a vindication for the Bucks, who were stung by the Indiana Pacers in last year's Cup semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were the only team from last season's semis to make it back to the final four in Vegas, beating the Orlando Magic in the quarter-finals and dispatching Atlanta in the semis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their Cup success has been part of a massive turnaround after a dismal 2-8 start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have now won 13 of their last 16 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the rest of the Cup matches, the final doesn't count toward the regular-season record, nor do the players' performances count in their career stats.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trophy does come with a financial reward with each player on the winning team set to pocket more than US$514,971 – a significant chunk of money for the younger players and lesser lights on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder players will take home US$205,988 apiece for the runner-up finish. (AFP)

    'Set up one-stop platform for after-death procedures'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan on Wednesday urged the government to set up a one-stop thematic website for after-death arrangements so the public do not have to go to various sites to get information.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's office investigated public services relating to after-death arrangements, including death registrations, mortuary services, cremations and burial services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that these services are provided by different government departments, and people seeking information might have to check with each one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department launched its own after-death arrangements thematic website in November, but the authorities should set up a website coordinating services by all the various departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would be most useful and helpful to the bereaved families if there's one thematic interdepartmental website so that the family could just use that website to gather all the essential information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second recommendation is to provide a digital form for the bereaved family to apply for different certificates and procedures, instead of having to go to different departments and authorities to apply for different certifications or whatever document they need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also suggested the government provide more electronic application procedures to make services more convenient for the public.
