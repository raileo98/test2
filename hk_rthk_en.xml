<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Semenyo struck in the first minute as Bournemouth boosted their hopes of qualifying for continental competition with a 1-0 Premier League victory over fellow European hopefuls Fulham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forward Semenyo clinically pounced on an early error on Monday from Cottagers captain Antonee Robinson to claim his 10th goal of the season and earn the Cherries a first win in seven league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson went close to doubling the hosts' lead when he struck the woodwork before Andoni Iraola's men hung on to climb to eighth – above their opponents and Brighton on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Sessegnon squandered the best of Fulham's chances to equalise – heading straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth had taken just two points from a possible 18 during a dramatic drop-off in form since going fifth with a 3-1 success at Southampton on February 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they were ahead inside a minute against their London opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Scott led the counter attack following a loose pass from Timothy Castagne and, after Robinson's mistake, Semenyo nipped in to cut inside Joachim Andersen and curl the ball into the bottom-left corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson rattled the crossbar from close range in the 16th minute while Fulham also looked dangerous going forward during an entertaining first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth boss Iraola brought on Illia Zabarnyi for Marcos Senesi at half-time and his side nearly doubled their lead 10 minutes after the re-start, when the legs of goalkeeper Bernd Leno denied Tyler Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham manager Silva made three changes, bringing on Tom Cairney, Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez, with Sessegnon, Sander Berge and Rodrigo Muiz withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth stopper Kepa clawed away an Alex Iwobi effort and comfortably saved from Sasa Lukic as the visitors pushed for a leveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, VAR deemed Leno got fingertips to the ball when Evanilson went down in the box seeking a penalty, 10 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts comfortably held on during seven minutes of added time to claim an overdue victory – their first at home since thrashing Nottingham Forest 5-0 in January – and put their European push back on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All season long we have been grinding and beating the top six teams," Bournemouth goalscorer Semenyo told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This little phase we are going through, losing and drawing, every team goes through that but that is why this win is so important.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like what we have done this year we do definitely deserve the European places." (AFP)

<img alt="Paige Bueckers poses with WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert after being selected with the number one overall pick to the Dallas Wings.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paige Bueckers was chosen by the Dallas Wings with the number one pick in the WNBA draft on Monday, crowning a successful season that saw her lead the University of Connecticut to the US college championship this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old point guard had been the overwhelming favourite to be selected first by the Wings, and will enter a league that has surged in popularity in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just an overwhelming sense of gratitude, it's super surreal just being here," Bueckers said moments after her selection at a ceremony in New York before paying tribute to her coaches and teammates at Connecticut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All their hard work helped me get to this stage," Bueckers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't do it alone – it took a village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the draft, Bueckers told ESPN reaching the WNBA marked the realisation of a near-lifelong dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since I was five, it's the reason I played the game," she told the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since I picked up the ball I had big dreams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bueckers enjoyed a fairytale final season in collegiate basketball, leading the Huskies to a blowout 82-59 win over the South Carolina Gamecocks on April 6 after missing most of the previous two seasons with injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't even put into words everything that's happened this past week, the entire year, the journey," she told ESPN on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It didn't really hit me until I saw the stage today. It's just surreal."
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after Caitlin Clark's rise took college basketball and the WNBA by storm, Bueckers has enjoyed a similarly meteoric journey to the world's top women's basketball league.
  <br>
  <br>
  US sports equipment giant Nike made her the first college athlete to have a sneaker named after them, and she has also signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Gatorade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after leading UConn to the college title this month, Bueckers said her success had been shaped by her determination to fight through a litany of injuries that included a torn meniscus in 2021 and a torn anterior cruciate ligament in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a story of resilience, of gratitude, of adversity, of overcoming adversity, just responding to life's challenges," she said of her career trajectory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be shaped, to be the person that I am today ... obviously you feel like on the other side of a really hard time is a really big blessing."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other early draft selections on Monday, French teenager Dominique Malonga was chosen with the second pick by the Seattle Storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing to me," the 6ft 6in 19-year-old Olympic silver medalist said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so happy to represent France, but not only France, Cameroon and Congo. I'm a multicultural person. I will work very hard to fit in this league, because I know it's gonna be tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame's Sonia Citron was chosen with the third pick by the Washington Mystics. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Harbin, in northeast Heilongjiang province, said on Tuesday they were pursuing three operatives affiliated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) over suspected cyberattacks against China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Harbin public security bureau named the three as Katheryn A Wilson, Robert J Snelling, and Stephen W Johnson, accusing them of launching cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games that took place in Harbin in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said investigations by Chinese technical teams said the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival and departure management, and competition entry platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said these systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also accused the NSA of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defence research institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They accused the three NSA operatives of repeated cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and cyber operations on companies such as Huawei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities stated that their technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launched his fiancee Lauren Sanchez into space on Monday with an all-female celebrity crew that included Katy Perry and Gayle King.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest wave in space tourism, where more of the rich and famous than ever before - or lucky and well-connected - can enter the zero-gravity realm traditionally dominated by professional astronauts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Shepard rocket blasted off on the quick up-and-down trip from West Texas. The fringes of space beckoned 107 kilometres up and provided a few precious minutes of weightlessness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and “CBS Mornings” co-host King.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moved by the views of Earth below, Perry said she couldn't resist singing “What a Wonderful World" in space.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezos marry in Venice.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963 when Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15 percent of the more than 700 people who have travelled into space. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Department of Education on Monday froze more than US$2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University, just hours after the school rejected US President Donald Trump's demands that it make deep policy changes on diversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Department of Education task force on combating anti-semitism said in a statement that it was freezing US$2.2 billion in multi-year grants and US$60 million in multi-year contract value to Harvard University.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move marks a new level of contentiousness between the Trump administration and American universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for numerous universities, pressing the institutions to make policy and other changes and citing what it says is a failure to fight anti-semitism on campus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deportation proceedings have begun against some detained foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while visas for hundreds of other students have been cancelled. The crackdown has raised concerns about speech and academic freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvard on Monday rejected Trump administration demands that to receive federal funding it end diversity efforts and take other steps that the university said would stifle intellectual freedoms of faculty and students. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has opened the door to potential tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals and semiconductor imports, according to government filings on Monday, shortly after US President Donald Trump warned recent tech exclusions would only be temporary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commerce secretary has initiated a pair of investigations into the national security effects of imports of pharmaceuticals and ingredients, as well as semiconductors and chip-making equipment, according to filings to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probes were launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, according to the filings, and this was the same legal mechanism that Trump previously used to impose other sector-specific duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed sweeping tariffs on US trading partners - hitting imports from China with especially stiff rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has also imposed a series of sector-specific levies, recently slapping tariffs on imports of steel, aluminium and autos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Department's latest filings call for public comment on pharma and semiconductors imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes the impact of current trade policies on domestic semiconductor production and capacity, and whether additional measures like tariffs or quotas might be "necessary to protect national security." (AFP)

 The European Union on Monday announced a new three-year financial support package for the Palestinians worth US$1.8 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fresh aid pledge came as EU foreign ministers met Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa in Luxembourg for the first meeting of "high-level dialogue" between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are stepping up our support to the Palestinian people. 1.6 billion euros until 2027 will help stabilise the West Bank and Gaza," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU is looking to boost the Palestinian Authority as Israel has resumed its war in Gaza after a ceasefire largely put a halt to the fighting for two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will reinforce the authority's ability to meet the needs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and prepare it to return to govern Gaza once conditions allow," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU foreign policy chief reiterated the bloc's condemnation over the "total blockade of aid into Gaza" and insistence that there was no military solution to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mustafa said the international community faced a "moment of truth" over the situation in Gaza and the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came to demand clarity from the international community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels - the biggest international donor to the Palestinians - said the package would include 620 million euros in grants for the Palestinian Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds will be linked to reforms on "fiscal sustainability, democratic governance, private sector development and public infrastructure and services", the EU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest will be made up of 576 million euros in grants for projects aimed at helping economic recovery in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 400 million euros in loans would come from the bloc's lending arm, the European Investment Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's new package follows on from the previous three-year support plan worth 1.36 billion euros from 2021 to 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being a major provider of aid, the EU has struggled to exert influence in the crisis as its 27 countries clash frequently over their approach to the conflict. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rose worldwide on Monday after US President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least, and as stress from within the US bond market seems to be easing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 percent to 5,405, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.8 percent to 40,524, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6 percent to 16,831.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for US customers of products coming from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such an exemption would mean US importers don't have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple climbed 2.2 percent, and Dell Technologies rose 4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry. General Motors rose 3.5 percent, and Ford Motor rallied 4.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 1.9 percent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bond market also showed signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased following their sudden rise last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because US government bonds have historically been seen as some of the world’s safest investments, if not the safest.
  <br>
  <br>
  But last week, yields rose sharply for Treasury bonds in an usual move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of the US dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.37 percent. It had jumped to 4.48 percent on Friday from 4.01 percent the week before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of the US dollar, though, remained under pressure. It slipped against the euro and Japanese yen, while inching higher against the Canadian dollar. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday hosted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, who is now the US leader's key ally in a controversial push to deport illegal migrants to a notorious Salvadoran prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  The meeting comes as the White House faces pressure over the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a father who was mistakenly deported to the jail in the Central American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A federal judge ordered the government to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, but Trump officials contend he is now solely in Salvadoran custody, leaving the man in legal limbo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukele addressed the issue in his meeting with Trump, saying he would not return Abrego Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can I return him to the United States? It's like, I smuggle him into the United States?...I don't have the power to return him to the United States," Bukele said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukele, known for his stylish dress sense and social media savvy, is broadly popular at home for clamping down on once rampant drug gangs that terrorised El Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 43-year-old Salvadoran leader is accused of overseeing mass human rights violations, epitomised by a huge, brutal prison known as CECOT.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after Trump's inauguration for a second term, Bukele made the extraordinary offer to take in prisoners from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took the Salvadoran leader up on his proposal, sending more than 250 migrants there after invoking a rarely used wartime law dating to 1798, which stripped the deportees of due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slickly produced footage of their arrival - including chained and tattooed men having their heads shaved and being frog-marched by masked guards - was widely promoted by both the Salvadoran and US governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration contends that the migrants are members of criminal gangs designated by the United States as terrorist organisations, including El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, relatives of several of the men contend they have no connection to organised crime and in some cases had been swept up simply because they had tattoos unrelated to any gang activity. (AFP)

<img alt="Abdullah Badawi was prime minister of Malaysia from 2003 to 2009. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800359_1_20250414223012.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Malaysian prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi died on Monday, aged 85, his family and medical authorities reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah became Malaysia's fifth prime minister in 2003, following the resignation of veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad after 22 years at the helm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former premier died at 7.10pm at the National Heart Institute in the capital Kuala Lumpur, his son-in-law and former health minister Khairy Jamaluddin said in an Instagram post, without specifying a cause of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah was admitted to the National Heart Institute on Sunday after experiencing breathing difficulties and was immediately placed under intensive care, the institute said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all medical efforts, he passed away peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones," the institute said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As premier of the Muslim-majority country, Abdullah embarked on an anti-corruption drive and espoused a moderate version of Islam that aimed for economic and technological progress over religious fundamentalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he came under public criticism for his review of fuel subsidies that saw a sharp spike in prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdullah stepped down in 2009, a year after an election that saw the then-ruling Barisan Nasional coalition lose its parliamentary supermajority for the first time in the country's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was succeeded by Najib Razak. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Xi Jinping meets Vietnam's National Assembly chairman Tran Thanh Man in Hanoi.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Vietnam on Monday signed dozens of cooperation agreements, strengthening ties between the two countries after President Xi Jinping warned that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour, as Beijing tries to present itself as a stable alternative to an erratic US President Donald Trump, who announced – and then mostly reversed – sweeping tariffs this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi was welcomed to Hanoi with a 21-cannon salute, a guard of honour and rows of flag-waving children at the presidential palace, before holding talks with Vietnam's top leaders including General Secretary To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two neighbours signed 45 cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, AI, joint maritime patrols and railway development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit comes almost two weeks after the United States – manufacturing powerhouse Vietnam's biggest export market in the first three months of the year – slapped a 46 percent levy on Vietnamese goods as part of a global trade blitz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and most other countries have been paused, China still faces enormous levies and is seeking to tighten regional trade ties and offset their impact during Xi's first overseas trip of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will depart Vietnam on Tuesday, travelling onwards to Malaysia and Cambodia on a tour that "bears major importance" for the broader region, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking during a meeting with Lam, Xi said Vietnam and China were "standing at the turning point of history... and should move forward with joint hands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi earlier urged the two countries to "resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Beijing's line that a "trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere" in an article published on Monday in Vietnam's major state-run Nhan Dan newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam's Lam said in an article posted on the government's news portal on Monday that his country "is always ready to join hands with China to make cooperation between the two countries more substantive, profound, balanced and sustainable". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As Hong Kong moves towards legalising basketball betting, Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak stressed the government does not encourage gambling but that it's necessary to respond to demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Jockey Club is working on plans towards legalising basketball betting and members of the public can submit their views regarding the proposed legislation until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultation document also states that betting on local basketball matches will be prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Monday, Mak spoke about the need to regulate betting activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is, however, undeniably an actual and persistent demand for gambling in Hong Kong which, if left unregulated, would likely give rise to illegal gambling activities and associated social problems and other criminal activities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to make it very clear that, on illegal gambling, no matter which type of events or sports are involved, we will crack down on any illegal betting stringently.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak told lawmakers that the government will educate the public on the harms of gambling addiction, and provide counseling and support services to people in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club earlier estimated that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated each year after basketball betting is legalised.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday the global trade war could endanger global technology development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, he said governments and regulators around the world are facing challenges in such areas as cybersecurity, data privacy and cross-border regulatory arbitrage but that digital fragmentation is a more urgent concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The trade war initiated by the United States is likely to extend beyond tariffs," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can foresee more barriers, ‘larger yards’ and ‘higher walls,’ which could stifle innovation and jeopardise global technological progress,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to deal with the challenges and hold on to opportunities brought by the digital economy, he said the government has established a concrete action plan, which covers areas like digital infrastructure and governance, digital transformation, cross-boundary flow of data and talent development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at another conference, one on Jiangsu-Hong Kong innotech, he also said the US trade war is affecting the international trade order and putting the global industrial and supply chains at risk of disruptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong will make good use of its connectivity with both the mainland and the world and join hands with more mainland enterprises to attract investment from around the world.

 Pop star Katy Perry will be the biggest name in an all-woman group set to touch the edge of space on Monday, roaring into the cosmos on one of billionaire Jeff Bezos' rockets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Firework" and "California Gurls" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 9.30 pm Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's mission is the first all-woman space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line, the internationally recognized boundary of space.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part "for my daughter Daisy," whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, "to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space'," Perry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a separate video posted to Instagram that she was shocked to discover during space training that the capsule she will travel in was named the "Tortoise" and decorated with a "feather" design -- the two nicknames her parents have for her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no coincidences and I'm just so grateful for these confirmations and so grateful that I feel like something bigger than me is steering the ship," Perry said in the video. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rose on Monday as trade war fears were tempered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of tariff exemptions for electronics, although the greenback weakened and safe-haven gold hit a fresh record amid fears the relief would be short-lived.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market ended higher with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 2.4 percent at 21,417.40.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 2.11 percent to end at 7,965.81, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 2.34 percent to end at 5,015.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the wild gyrations witnessed last week, markets got off to a relatively stable start following Friday's news that the White House would exempt smartphones, semiconductors, computers and other devices from painful "reciprocal" levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement provided a much-needed injection of optimism for investors who had been sent scurrying for the hills in the wake of the US president's tariff flip-flops and tit-for-tat measures by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three main indexes on Wall Street finished solidly higher, helped by comments from a top Federal Reserve official that the central bank was prepared to step in to support financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia followed suit, with tech firms helping push Hong Kong more than two percent higher, while Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Jakarta and Manila were also well up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt also saw big gains in the morning, while US futures were all sharply higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a period of chaotic price action, chinks of light poke through the forest canopy providing a much-needed guide to the entities that price risk and liquidity for a living, which in turn, may see liquidity conditions improve and a relative calm return to markets," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Trump looked to temper the remarks on Sunday, saying the exemptions had been misconstrued and writing on his Truth Social platform that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors "over the next week".
  <br>
  <br>
  His commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said earlier chip levies would likely be in place "in a month or two".
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping said on Monday that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners, days after Beijing hit US goods with 125 percent duties but also suggested it would not retaliate further in the future. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department says the number of emergency response teams for extreme weather events will be increased this year from 160 to 180 for deployment in more than 30 operational stations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Department director Ringo Mok said the increase was made based on multiple factors, including resource availability and the current ability to respond to and bring flooding incidents under control within one to two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  'If we further increase the number of emergency teams by 20... that will be sufficient for us to cope with extreme weather," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, the increase in the number of emergency teams can reduce the deployment time as well as working time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will continue to apply innovative technology in flood prevention works, including robots that help to examine, clean and drain sewage, which has been in use since 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them are Crawler-type survey robots, River bots and Mobile Powerful Pumping Robot.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Yuen Long, an estimated HK$4.6 billion has been spent on a flood prevention construction project undergoing since May 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project includes a super drainage pump that can drain water volumes the equivalent of seven Olympic-size swimming pools, as well as automatic flood protection walls.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The progress of the Yuen Long project is going very well, and the project will be completed in stages by 2030... and the first part of the flood prevention facilities will be actually put into use by 2027," said Mok.

<img alt="Path of Democracy co-convenor Ray Poon, right, says the government can hold more promotional events to communicate the SAR’s actual situation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800325_1_20250414170630.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign investors' and workers’ confidence in Hong Kong remains positive despite the challenges the SAR faced in the past five years, a think tank said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Path of Democracy conducted a study last year to investigate the international community’s views on the city’s business environment, interviewing 12 foreign chambers of commerce and over 600 expats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that chamber representatives and around 70 percent of expats polled hold a neutral or positive attitude towards doing business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of expats and the international business community are optimistic towards Hong Kong’s business environment, even though there is intense competition from other cities including Sydney, Dubai, Riyadh and Singapore,” said co-convenor Ray Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested that the government should hold more promotional events for overseas trade to communicate the SAR’s actual situation to counter biased reports from Western media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the think tank said Hong Kong’s economic stability and status as a free port remains strong amid US tariffs, with only about one percent of the city’s total exports last year shipped to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure, it said, does not include re-export trading, which is largely made up of mainland goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added Hong Kong mainly exports garment, toys, and electronic products to the US, accounting for HK$6.1 billion. It said businesses could consider selling these products to other markets, such as Japan, South Korea, and Asean countries instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Path of Democracy also pointed out that exports to the US is not Hong Kong's economic lifeline, and over 90 percent of the city’s GDP relies on the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for residents to stay resilient under the ever-changing policies of US president Donald Trump.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech leaders from all over the world gathered in Hong Kong for the inaugural World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit on Monday, calling for stronger international partnerships in areas such as artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cybersecurity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event brought in around 1,000 participants from governments, industries and technology organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an opening-ceremony address, Hudaygulyyev Shihmyradowich, who chairs Turkmenistan’s state agency for communications and cybersecurity, said it's important to establish inclusive global cybersecurity standards amid the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Artificial intelligence is a key factor for advancing the digital economy, and Turkmenistan is ready to actively work with all interested partners within the framework of international cooperation to ensure that the use of AI is accessible to all and brings real benefits to our citizens and global community,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, John Hoffman, chief executive of GSMA – a global trade association representing mobile network operators – said a community platform has been established to help firms explore AI use cases and set industry standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The group is currently made up of 12 industry players, and we’re grateful to have the support of these Chinese stakeholders, China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom, who have been pioneers in this space,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And as a global organisation representing the mobile ecosystem, we know how valuable these collaborations are and I can’t wait to see the innovation unlocked by the community.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman also highlighted the need for a structured framework to guide the responsible use of AI, saying 20 organisations, including two from China, have adopted GSMA’s framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of Ghana Dot Com Nii Quaynor, often known as the “father of the Internet in Africa”, stressed the importance of creating a digital world that benefits everyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Quaynor, who established some of Africa’s first internet connections in the early 1990s, noted that while the continent’s  internet user base is growing rapidly, it still faces barriers such as a fragile infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned of three divides that are holding the continent back in realising its AI potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  “First, technical capacities and educational preparedness for adoption needs to improve to avoid division.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Secondly, the cost of equipment and infrastructure for training AI imposes an economic divide on participation on the supply side of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lastly, the electrical power to run these machines limits the ability to participate beyond user level, not to mention the need for bandwidth to even load parameters of models,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Quaynor said he hopes to explore cooperation opportunities through the summit and get his region more involved in the global tech supply chain.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing will fully support Hong Kong in "riding the tide of global digital transition", according to a senior national political adviser.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as he criticised "technological bullying" as well as the zero-sum game by some countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came on the opening day of the World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit in Hong Kong, the first time the conference is being held in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the opening ceremony, Wang Yong, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, noted said the digital transition has become a driving force in boosting industrial productivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is committed to sharing the opportunities brought about by the development of the internet industry with other regions in the world, noting that mainland firms such as DeepSeek, which has shared its open-source AI models with the global tech community, aim to remove such digital gaps between nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have worked with other countries to build a fair and 'just cyberspace governance system, and we firmly uphold the basic concepts and principles enshrined in the United Nations charter," Wang told some 1,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call for respecting the sovereignty and management model of each country's network and rejecting the zero-sum game and technological bullying," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Wang did not name the parties involved in such practices, Beijing has been calling for relations between China and the United States to not be a zero sum game and for both sides to seek common ground to gain a "win-win" outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Wang, Zheng Yanxiong, the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said the SAR plays a critical role in driving the industry's development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is a pioneer in the development of the internet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has not only its traditional advantages being a global financial, shipping and trade centre but also new advantages such as artificial intelligence research and development, accumulated talent and industrial synergy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, it has unique advantages such as institutional innovation, trilingualism, cultural inclusiveness, and internal and external communication... It will certainly be a new development highland of the internet industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zheng called on the SAR to play its role by speeding up the building of an ecosystem for digital-related sectors, covering artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and block chains, that spans upstream and downstream industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the SAR to give full play to the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, establishing a cross-border data flow mechanism that's also in line with international rules, and promote the safe and orderly cross-border data flow and sharing of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit ends on Tuesday.

  Noting that this year marks the 95th anniversary of the founding of the CPV, the 80th anniversary of the founding of Vietnam and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the South, Xi said the CPV has united and led the Vietnamese people in steadfast pursuit of realising the two goals set for the centenary of the party and the country respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that the Chinese side is pleased to see that living standards in Vietnam have steadily improved, Vietnam's global and regional influence has continued to grow, and the country has made notable progress in advancing its socialist industrialisation and modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi expressed his belief that under the strong leadership of the CPV Central Committee, Vietnam will surely pursue the socialist path suited to its national conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Foreign Ministry said the president called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields.

  He will also visit Malaysia and Cambodia on his current overseas trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs, Xia Baolong, is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech via video link at the 10th National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the SAR, the ceremony and a seminar will take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee expressed gratitude to Xia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, for his guidance and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that this year marks the fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the National Security Law, as well as the first anniversary of the implementation of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the world is undergoing unprecedented changes at an accelerating pace. The geopolitical landscape is getting complicated, regional conflicts are frequent, global economic growth is slowing down, and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, all contributing to increasing global instability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Hong Kong faced with ever-changing national security risks, the HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, deepen the understanding of a holistic approach to national security, continuously improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security, and actively promote national security education across society," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE also said the authorities will co-ordinate school and community activities to promote national security education.

    Don't judge healthcare reform by fee hikes, Lo says

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800289_1_20250414133802.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health secretary says it is unreasonable to judge upcoming changes in public hospital charges simply by focusing on fee increases for certain services, stressing that an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible for partial or full fee waivers under the proposal.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Lo Chung-mau fielded questions on the reform, which is set to take effect from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election committee representative Chan Wing-kwong noted that people seeking general outpatient services will soon have to pay HK$150 per consultation, triple the current amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What factors do you consider when deciding on the new fee level?" he asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are fee waivers, but for those who are not eligible, how do you ensure they receive prompt medical assistance even when they are facing financial difficulties?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo said it was unreasonable to judge the reform simply by focusing on how much more patients will have to pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the government’s goal is to gradually reduce the subsidy rate for public hospital services from 97.6 to 90 percent over five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wouldn't say a reduction to 90 percent is our ultimate goal either because the reform will continue," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also need to evaluate the overall sustainability of Hong Kong's healthcare system and financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we’re adjusting the fees based on the subsidy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wish to retain a higher subsidy rate for in-patient and complicated services, while the subsidy level will be lowered for outpatient and minor cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health secretary added that the aim of the reform is to focus resources on helping the most critically ill patients, while 1.4 million people will benefit from a revamped fee waiver mechanism, up from the existing 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many lawmakers felt it was not easy for patients to find out if they are eligible for the waiver or which procedures will be covered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong said people receiving welfare payments will obviously be eligible but noted there are only 600,000 or so of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What about the remaining 800,000 people – how can they tell if they’re eligible too?" he asked.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Lam, who represents the medical and health services sector, wanted to know if patients can pre-register for waivers or only find out whether they are eligible after a consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said any fee reduction is time-sensitive as the patient must meet income and asset requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as authorities are well prepared and applications are not unduly delayed, there is no need for patients to pre-apply first," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko said patients who face sudden financial hardships can seek a one-off waiver from a social worker.

    Tech businesses voice optimism amid trade tensions

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech businesses attending  the World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit in Hong Kong on Monday expressed confidence in navigating escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, Keeson Technology, a leading Chinese manufacturer of high-tech beds and other sleep products, said the company will not give up on the American market despite tariff pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Jack Tang said that to mitigate the tariff impact, the company has diversified its supply chain across different regions, including Southeast Asia and North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will focus on building our supply chain more reasonably because our products are very popular in the US market – in fact, we've captured over 50 percent of market share,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At its core, this isn't really about the trade war but about meeting essential consumer needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our current diversified setup, we believe we can effectively avoid the negative impacts of these trade tensions.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Fano Labs, a locally based AI startup that specialises in speech recognition and conversation analysis for fraud detection, said it has yet to feel any impact from the US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-founder and chief executive Miles Wen said that’s because of the company's software-based business model and global demand for its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the company is also looking to tap new markets for growth opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think there's a little bit of tension between the two big nations, but many other markets are more neutral and looking more towards economic growth," Wen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's where people can look at.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's also why we're looking at markets in Australia, Europe and Southeast Asia,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wen stressed as a startup that is a spin-off from a University of Hong Kong research team, it also needs stronger support from the government as part of its efforts to bolster the city’s tech sector.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on global firms to pursue their business expansion in collaboration with the SAR at a time of spiralling global geopolitical and trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks at the opening of the World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit 2025 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, where some 1,000 political and business elites as well as academics from over 30 countries and regions gathered to discuss the latest technological advancements in the internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opening of the two-day summit also marks the event's debut in the SAR, after previously being mainly held in Wuzhen in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong has a lot to offer as he called on global investors and firms to prioritise collaboration in these particularly  challenging times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong champions free trade and multilateralism," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe in teamwork and offer a range of welcoming programmes for investors, companies, researchers and other strategic talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong welcomes all business interests from those who are keen to pursue development with us.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this global city, we will make a dedicated difference for you and your future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee noted that the SAR is dedicated to maximising the use of artificial intelligence technology to assist the city in its goal of "new industrialisation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he believes the Northern Metropolis, which occupies a site equivalent to up to a third of the city's land area and sits next to Shenzhen, will emerge as a global top innovation and technology (I&T) hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident that our collaborative efforts with Shenzhen, and throughout the Greater Bay Area, will see the rise of Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone as a world-class I&T hub, creating a critical source of new quality productive forces for the country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Themed “Integration of AI and Digital Technologies Shaping the Future – Jointly Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace”, the event's Hong Kong debut also marks the first time that the WIC, also known as the Wuzhen Summit, is hosting an Asia-Pacific edition of the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key topics during the event's forums includes tech trends in AI, digital finance, e-government and smart living.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World leaders condemned the latest Russian missile strike on Ukraine, one of the deadliest attacks in months, while US President Donald Trump called it a "horrible thing" and a "mistake".
 <br>
  <br>
  Two ballistic Iskander-M/KN-23 missiles hit the centre of the northeastern city of Sumy, close to the Russian border, on Sunday morning, killing at least 34 people and wounding more than 100 others, Ukrainian authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian attack damaged 20 buildings in total, including a university, five apartment buildings, cafes, shops and the district court, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and push Trump's efforts to end the more than three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it was terrible. And I was told they made a mistake. But I think it's a horrible thing. I think the whole war is a horrible thing," US President Trump said on board Air Force One while headed back to Washington on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to clarify what he meant by a "mistake", Trump said that "they made a mistake... you're gonna ask them" – without specifying who or what he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the attack "horrifying" and a "tragic reminder of why President Trump and his administration are putting so much time and effort into trying to end this war and achieve durable peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was "deeply alarmed and shocked" by the strike, which highlighted a "devastating pattern of similar assaults on Ukrainian cities and towns in recent weeks", his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's President Emmanuel Macron said the strike showed Russia's "blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump".
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was "appalled" by the attack, which Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni described as a "cowardly" act by Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz described it as "a serious war crime, deliberate and intended". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Incumbent President Daniel Noboa claimed a runaway victory in Ecuador's presidential election, after voters endorsed the young leader's "iron fist" approach to rampant cartel violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  With over 90 percent of the votes counted, the National Election Council said Noboa had an unassailable 12-point lead over his leftist rival Luisa Gonzalez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official results showed Noboa with 56 percent of the vote, against Gonzalez's 44 percent – a far bigger winning margin than expected after a virtual tie in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to jubilant supporters in his hometown of Olon, the 37-year-old president claimed a "historic victory".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A huge hug to all those Ecuadorians who always believed in this young president!" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ecuadorians have spoken, from tomorrow morning we will go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gonzalez – seemingly shocked by her weak showing and perhaps the end of her dream of becoming Ecuador's first woman president – immediately questioned the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  She accused Noboa of "the most grotesque electoral fraud" and called for a recount of the ballots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I refuse to believe that the people prefer lies over the truth," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She did not immediately provide evidence for her claims of fraud. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools across Hong Kong are embracing creative ways to mark National Security Education Day this Tuesday, which will blend interactive learning with civic engagement to deepen students’ understanding of the nation’s heritage, security and cultural values.
 <br>
  <br>
  Educators aim to promote national security education in ways that resonate beyond textbooks, through quizzes, hands-on exhibits and cross-border exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the schools, Ma On Shan Ling Liang Primary School, recently launched a “School History Room and National Education Archive" centre housing historical displays, national education books and rotating exhibitions to bring lessons to life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Classes regularly attend specialised sessions there, exploring topics ranging from national security to other topics like flood prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the learning does not stop beyond the classroom doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hallways, students can deepen their knowledge about the nation by taking quizzes on large touch screens. Correct answers reward participants with prizes from a large capsule vending machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are questions about ethnic minority groups in the game. While playing the game, I get to learn about the cultures of the different groups, so I enjoy playing it quite a bit,” said Sin, a primary four pupil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, Lee, said the rewards had piqued her curiousity about the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the school’s flag-raising team had also gained first-hand insight on the ceremony during a two-day exchange trip to Shenzhen last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team member Choi said she was inspired by the discipline and precision demonstrated by flag-raising teams on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Principal Yuen Kin-ming said that the school is committed to making education engaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When it comes to history and culture, classroom teaching alone has its limits. By placing interactive displays in common areas, students absorb knowledge naturally as they walk by,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want learning to feel organic, not forced. We don’t want them to just memorise things rigidly, like in dictation exercises. What we really hope is for them to absorb knowledge gradually.”
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the one-off HK$300,000 government subsidy for Chinese cultural immersion activities, Yuen shared plans to host traditional lion dances and Chinese opera-style face-changing performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  He offered assurances that the funds are being used thoughtfully to enrich students’ connection to Chinese heritage.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports rose 12.4 percent year-on-year in March, beating analysts' expectations as the world's second largest economy braces for an intensifying trade war with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs data also showed on Monday that imports contracted 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Export growth last month was driven by Chinese factories rushing out shipments ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyu Daliang, a spokesman for the General Administration of Customs, said China is facing a severe and complex external situation, but that the sky would not fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, China has actively diversified its markets and deepened industrial and supply chain cooperation with partners worldwide. This has not only fuelled the development of other economies, but also strengthened our own resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, China's vast domestic market serves as a crucial stabilising force. We will remain steadfast in focusing on our own priorities, using our internal certainty to navigate external uncertainties."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has ramped up duties on Chinese goods to eye-watering levels of 145 percent, prompting Beijing to raise retaliatory tariffs on US imports. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 SF Express Hong Kong announced that it will stop sending SMS text messages to customers starting on Monday in the wake of a rising risk of fraudulent scams posed by counterfeit messages.
 <br>
  <br>
  The courier said all notifications for package pick-ups will now be sent exclusively through the official mobile application.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it received more than 800 inquiries and reports of fraud in the first quarter, a nearly fourfold increase compared to the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of the cases involved scammers sending text messages that masqueraded as having emanated from the company and claiming delivery addresses were incomplete or required additional shipping fees, it said, thereby tricking individuals into entering personal information on fake websites or making transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Theodora Lee from the police's Anti-Deception Coordination Centre welcomed SF Express's decision to cease sending SMS pick-up notifications, stating that this move sets a good example within the industry and helps raise public awareness of counterfeit messages.
  <br>
  <br>
  SF Express Hong Kong started transitioning from SMS notifications to the "SFHK APP" for package pick-up alerts since August.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department said on Monday that more than six million travellers will use the city's border control points throughout the Easter holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About five million of them will pass through the eight land control points to and from the mainland, with Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay to receive more passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It expects foot traffic will be higher on Friday and next Monday – the first and last day of the holiday weekend – and puts the numbers at around 759,000 and 618,000 travellers, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it will closely monitor the flow of travellers and vehicles going through the crossings and adopt traffic diversion plans if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advised all travellers to plan their journeys in advance and refrain from travelling during peak hours to avoid congestion and long waiting times.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said permanent residents aged seven to ten that meet the minimum height requirement of 1.1 metres, can use e-Channels at all control points – a measure implemented last month to enhance clearance efficiency at the checkpoints.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter company involved in the Hudson River crash in New York City on Thursday that killed all six people on board including three children was shutting down operations immediately.
 <br>
  <br>
  The chopper run by New York Helicopter Tours also lacked flight recorders, the National Transportation Safety Board also said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No video or camera recorders have been recovered from the Bell 206 helicopter, the NTSB said, and none of the equipment on it had recorded information that would help the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers from the NYPD were continuing to search for parts of the helicopter, including the main rotor, gearbox, tail rotor and the tail boom, the safety agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was "analyzing airplane/helicopter hotspots nationwide" and it would hold a helicopter safety panel meeting on April 22 to discuss the findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York Helicopter Tours said on its website it was referring all requests for comment to the FAA and NTSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft, whose passengers included a senior executive of Siemens AG, his wife and three children, had its last major inspection done on March 1, and had completed seven tour flights before the crash, according to federal investigators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Divers recovered the victims' remains as well as the pilot from the submerged helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were declared dead at the scene, while the remaining two died later after they were transported to nearby hospitals. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said Washington's move to impose tariffs on imports from around the world does not conform to international practice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Sing Tao Daily published on Monday, Chan said that by imposing "very high" tariffs, the United States wanted other countries to act according to its wishes and neglected international norms and free trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also denounced the United States for imposing sanctions on mainland and Hong Kong officials, saying they represented  interference in the nation's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that threats to national security still exist as interference in the SAR's national security trials show.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public has to develop an awareness of the need to safeguard national security, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also told local newspaper Ta Kung Pao that national security does not just include military security, pointing to the threat of financial systemic risks posed by the so-called "reciprocal tariffs" imposed by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said recent US adjustments to the levies are not simply an economic measure but carry a political motive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior official said the US tariffs have seriously affected Hong Kong's business environment and financial security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan emphasised that in the face of unreasonable suppression from external forces, the public has to be more united and safeguard the nation's sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the 10th National Security Education Day, he said an opening ceremony and thematic seminar will be held on Tuesday and that a thematic exhibition to mark the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the national security law will be held this quarter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading commentator on Chinese affairs on Monday said the US trade war would prove costly for all concerned, including the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said China would not only defend its interests, but also protect the world trading order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this round of the trade war, the United States is absolutely the wrong party. It started the war. It instigated the war. It used maximum pressure and intimidation against almost all the other countries, and China needs to do the right thing, that is jump up to the occasion and fiercely defend its legitimate interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, for the rest of the world, China needs to exercise a leadership role in defending free trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao said American consumers would suffer as the tariffs made goods more expensive and suspected Washington was using the threat of import taxes to weaponise the global trading system to its own ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It still demonstrates that the US administration, as far as the maximum tariffs are concerned, is still using these tariffs as a weapon, trying to achieve other goals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's blackmail, maximum pressure, intimidation, or bringing in other strategic goals, it remains to be seen. Therefore, I think, the Chinese position is to call on the US government to do the right thing and to cancel all the tariffs, because that is the only right thing to do."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim insists he understands the criticism levelled at him and his team after another Premier League loss at Newcastle United but claims losing games is worse than any personal condemnation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side were beaten on Sunday for the 14th time in the league this season – matching the number of defeats they suffered in the entire 2023-2024 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  United did put together some encouraging passages of play at St James' Park but Harvey Barnes' double, capitalising on some generous defending, left Amorim's team languishing down in 14th in the standings with six games left.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand [criticism] but I don't care," Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing is worse than losing games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People can say whatever they want to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to defend myself or anything like that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at our position in the table, it says it all."
  <br>
  <br>
  On course for their worst-ever Premier League points haul, Amorim made five changes to his starting XI, with a crucial Europa League quarter-final second leg against Olympique Lyonnais to come on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One change grabbed the headlines after first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana was left out of the squad, with Altay Bayindir handed his Premier League debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Turkey international struggled, however, with his error gifting Newcastle their fourth goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we put a different XI we don't know the result," Amorim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we had to make choices, we played three days ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to analyse the game, but we need to focus on the next one, we cannot change this one, the next one is massive for us, so let's focus on the next one on Thursday to play better and to win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other key games, Liverpool are within touching distance of the Premier League title after Virgil van Dijk sealed a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz's first-half strike at Anfield was cancelled out by Andrew Robertson's late own goal, but van Dijk headed Liverpool's winner in the closing moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side are 13 points clear of second-placed Arsenal with six games left.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Molineux, Tottenham hit a new low as Wolves virtually sealed their survival with a vibrant 4-2 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham travel to Eintracht Frankfurt for the quarter-final second leg on Thursday after being held to a 1-1 draw by the German team in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are 14 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich, who look destined for relegation despite holding Chelsea to a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. (Reuters/AFP)

    Nobel literature laureate Vargas Llosa passes away

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who enchanted readers with his intellectual rigor and lyrical prose for five decades and came close to being president of his country, has died aged 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  He passed away in the country's capital Lima surrounded by his family and "at peace," his son Alvaro Vargas Llosa, a well-known political commentator, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A leading light in the 20th century Latin American literature boom, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2010 for works like "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter," "Death in the Andes," and "The War of the End of the World."
  <br>
  <br>
  But early on he abandoned the socialist ideas that were embraced by many of his peers, and his dabbling in politics and conservative views annoyed much of Latin America's leftist intellectual class.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1990, he ran for president of Peru, saying he wanted to save his country from economic chaos and a Marxist insurgency.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost in the run-off to Alberto Fujimori, a then-unknown agronomist and university professor who defeated the insurgents but was later jailed for human rights crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frustrated by his loss, the writer moved to Spain but remained influential in Latin America, where he harshly criticized a new wave of strident leftist leaders led by then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his dozens of novels, plays and essays, Vargas Llosa told stories from various viewpoints and experimented with form -moving back and forth in time and switching narrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  His work crossed genres and established him as a foundational figure in a generation of writers that led a resurgence in Latin American literature in the 1960s.
  <br>
  <br>
  His books often examined the unnerving relationships between leaders and their subjects. "The Feast of the Goat" (2000) details the brutal regime of Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, while "The War of the End of the World" (1981) tells the true story of a fanatical preacher whose flock dies in a deadly war with Brazil's army in the 1890s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born to middle-class parents in Arequipa, Peru, on March 28, 1936, Vargas Llosa lived in Bolivia and the Peruvian capital Lima. He later made a home in Madrid, but retained influence in Peru, where he wrote for newspapers about current events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vargas Llosa frequently drew from personal experience and his family, at times inserting characters based on his own life into his tales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 1970s, Vargas Llosa, a one-time supporter of the Cuban revolution, denounced Fidel Castro, maddening many of his leftist literary colleagues like Colombian writer and fellow Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1976, the two had a famous argument, throwing punches outside a theater in Mexico City. A friend of Garcia Marquez said Vargas Llosa was upset that the Colombian had consoled his wife during an estrangement but Vargas Llosa refused to discuss it. (Reuters)

    Israel intensifies strikes across Gaza

<div class="itemFullText">
 A wave of Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday hit a hospital and other sites, killing at least 21 people, including children, as Israel vowed to expand its security presence in the small coastal strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was the latest of several attacks on northern Gaza's last major hospital providing critical health care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital director Dr Fadel Naim said the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings were severely damaged, affecting over 100 patients and dozens of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  One patient, a girl, died during the evacuation following an Israeli warning because staff were unable to provide urgent care, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Israel said it struck a Hamas command and control centre at the hospital. Hamas denied the allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Ahli Hospital is run by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which condemned the attack, saying in a statement it happened on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, and worshippers in Gaza City marked it in a church whose gilded trim and intact walls were a contrast to the widespread debris elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Sunday, a strike on a car in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed at least seven people including six brothers, according to staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The youngest brother was 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their father, Ibrahim Abu Mahadi, said his sons worked for a charity that distributes food to Palestinians. "For what sin were they killed?” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP reporters saw the mangled, bloodied car as relatives wept over the bodies. Israel's military asserted that it killed the deputy head of a Hamas sniper cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  An airstrike Sunday afternoon hit a house in the urban Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, killing at least seven people including two women, according to the Indonesian hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said in a statement it had struck over 90 militant targets over the past 48 hours including command and control centres, tunnels and weapons. The military also said it had intercepted a projectile fired from Gaza. (AP)

 James Harden scored 39 points as the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors 124-119 in overtime to clinch the final playoff spot in a thrilling last day of the NBA regular season on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Harden's superb display in San Francisco helped the Clippers bag the fifth seed in the Western Conference and sets up a first-round postseason series with the fourth-seeded Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Harden's points tally included two crucial back-to-back three-pointers in overtime which ultimately proved decisive in a back-and-forth duel that saw the lead change hands 23 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat for Golden State means the Warriors must now secure their place in the playoffs via the four-team play-in tournament starting this week, hosting Memphis on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden meanwhile praised the Clippers' composure in closing out victory in front of the Warriors' vociferous home support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew it was gonna be a hostile environment, and the main goal was just to win the game," Harden told ESPN. "Whether it's scoring, whether it's playmaking...it's whatever it takes at this point."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win was the Clippers' eighth straight victory to close out the regular season, ensuring they will enter the playoffs as the form team in the Western Conference after a campaign where few gave them much hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know we're a good team and we're excited to show the world that we're a good team," Harden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden was backed with 33 points from Kawhi Leonard while Ivica Zubac added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Curry led Golden State's scoring with 36 points while Jimmy Butler added 30 points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi starts a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia this week, beginning his state visits with Vietnam from April 14 to 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged strengthening coordination and cooperation through regional initiatives such as the East Asia Cooperation and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the ministry said, citing an article by the president published in Vietnam media.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called such efforts necessary to "inject more stability and positive energy into a chaotic and intertwined world".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Xi said China welcomes more high-quality imports from Vietnam and encourages more Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in the Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries should expand cooperation in emerging fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence and green development, the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit, planned for weeks, comes as Beijing faces 145 percent US duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened US tariffs of 46 percent that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will visit Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's trip to Hanoi is his second in less than 18 months. The two are set to sign about 40 agreements in multiple sectors, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son said on Saturday, noting Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation on railways, agricultural trade and the digital and green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is also seeking Vietnam's approval for its COMAC planes. (Agencies)

 A 38-year-old man was in custody and will face attempted homicide and aggravated arson charges after setting a fire overnight at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, state authorities said at a press conference at the governor's mansion in Harrisburg on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, identified as Cody Balmer from Harrisburg, whose motive is still unknown, slipped over a fence around the property carrying homemade incendiary devices and evaded state troopers long enough to enter the residence, set it on fire and leave, said Pennsylvania police officials. He was apprehended shortly before the press conference on Sunday.

  State police banged on the bedroom doors of Shapiro and his family around 2 am to evacuate them as local firefighters extinguished the blaze. No one was injured, although burn marks could be seen on parts of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shapiro, a Democrat seen as a potential candidate for his party's presidential nomination in 2028, said at the press conference that FBI Director Kash Patel had spoken to him a few hours earlier and promised "all the resources of the federal government" in investigating the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The residence was set on fire hours after Shapiro posted a picture of his family's "seder" table as they celebrated the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover, which is about going "from slavery into freedom," according to Shapiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us as they did here last night," he said on Sunday, vowing to continue his work for Pennsylvania without fear. Shapiro added that his family still planned to hold a second seder on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether the attack could have been a hate-motivated crime, Shapiro said he would defer to the findings from federal authorities and Pennsylvania's district attorney.
  <br>
  <br>
  A "multifaceted review in terms of security measures and the exact timeline of how it happened" will be carried out, said Lieutenant Christopher Paris, commissioner of the Pennsylvania state police. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tariff exemptions announced on Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of US tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the US. (AP)

 Rory McIlroy beat Justin Rose on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff at the Masters on Sunday to become the sixth player, and first European, to complete the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors.
 <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who squandered a four-shot lead on the back nine during regulation, wasted no time in the playoff as he stuffed his approach at the par-four 18th two feet from the cup for a tap-in birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  For McIlroy, who was making his 11th attempt at completing the Grand Slam, the feat marked a crowing achievement in his career and delivered his first major title since August 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Northern Irishman had a chance to seal the win in regulation but missed a five-foot par putt at the 18th hole where Rose had earlier closed his round with a 20-footer for birdie. (Reuters)

    Trump's doctor says US president in 'excellent health'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump is in "excellent health," a White House doctor's assessment said on Sunday, after he underwent his first annual medical checkup since returning to the US presidency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, 78, has repeatedly boasted about his own vigour since starting a second term, while mocking his 82-year-old Democratic predecessor Joe Biden as decrepit and mentally unfit for office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State," read a physician's letter shared by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted only a few abnormalities that included minor sun damage to Trump's skin, as well as scarring on his right ear from a gunshot wound after he was shot at in an assassination attempt last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire had told reporters on Friday he felt "in very good shape" after his exam earlier that day at the Walter Reed military hospital in the Washington suburbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been accused of a lack of openness about his health despite huge interest in the well-being of America's commander-in-chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said previously that presidential physician Sean Barbabella would give a readout of the physical and that "of course" it would provide the full report. (AFP)

    Alcaraz sees off Musetti to win Monte Carlo Masters

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz had to come from behind to beat Lorenzo Musetti. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800189_1_20250413204452.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory over the Italian Lorenzo Musetti.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marks a sixth Masters title for the 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam winner, and his most prestigious title since winning Wimbledon last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time," said Alcaraz, who lost in his first match on his only previous appearance at the tournament in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really proud of my myself for how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coming here and seeing how all the hard work has paid off, I'm really happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, who will move up a place in the rankings and displace Alexander Zverev at number 2, had to come from behind to beat the Italian, who had already taken down two Top 10 players, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, on his way to his first Masters 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musetti dropped his opening service but then fought his way back into the first set as Alcaraz appeared at odds with his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard bounced back, however, lifting his game as he galloped through the second set 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trend continued as Musetti began to have problems with his right leg, receiving treatment when he was 0-3 in the decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  He battled on but could not live with the intensity or physicality of Alcaraz's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches," said Alcaraz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done, to end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some consolation for Musetti is a rise to number 11 in the rankings and the promise of more to come on the clay as the season builds towards the French Open at Roland Garros next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably one of my best tournaments so far," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge." (AFP)

    Russian strike on Ukraine's Sumy kills at least 34

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Russian strike on Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy killed at least 34 people, including two children, and wounded dozens on Sunday, Kyiv said, in the deadliest attack in months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Russia launched ballistic missiles on Sumy's city centre on Palm Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came two days after US envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet its leader, Vladimir Putin and despite US President Donald Trump urging Moscow to end the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sumy lies close to the Russian border and has come under increasing attack in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses reported seeing bodies covered in silver sheets strewn across the centre of the city, as well as a severely destroyed trolleybus, and rescuers working through the rubble of a building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers said the strike hit the city centre "right when there were many people on the street."
  <br>
  <br>
  They said people were wounded or killed "in the middle of the street, in cars, public transport, and in houses."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second Russian attack with a large civilian death toll this month as Trump voices some anger at Moscow for "bombing like crazy" in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky called on the world to put pressure on Russia to end the three-year war and called for a "strong response" from Europe and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs," Zelensky said, two days after Witkoff held hours-long talks with Putin in Saint Petersburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enemy missiles hit an ordinary city street, an ordinary life: houses, educational institutions, cars on the street," he said on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has not yet commented on the strike. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic Party said on Sunday it will start sorting out financial and administrative matters, after about 110 members authorised its leadership in a special meeting to follow up on the group's disbandment.
 <br>
  <br>
  But party chairman Lo Kin-hei told reporters that a date has yet to be set for a general meeting to be held to discuss the disbandment proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said winding-up procedures can be initiated only after 75 percent of attendees at that meeting pass a motion to disband.
  <br>
  <br>
  A liquidator will then be commissioned to manage the party's account until there's no money left, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said another meeting will be held so the liquidator can update members on the progress, after which the party will file documents to the Company Registry to complete the winding-up procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any outstanding assets after liquidation, he said, will be donated to local groups and charities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Party vice-chairman Mok Kin-shing, meanwhile, said there are quite a number of procedures ahead, and the group may not be able to complete them this year.

 The financial secretary on Sunday said he believes the Hong Kong market is stable and attractive, especially against the backdrop of global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Paul Chan also urged different sectors to lure foreign capital and talent amid changes in the global market, saying the United States' so-called reciprocal tariffs have caused severe volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR government will maintain vigilance and enhance monitoring, forecasting, and planning to cope with the evolving situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can break new ground amid the changing landscape, as long as people stay united and do their best," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many large-scale international financial institutions and long-term capital are looking to step up participation in the Hong Kong market, he added, while overseas scientists and scholars are considering relocating to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively attracting quality issuers from all over the world to list in Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing have been instructed to make preparations for a possible surge in mainland firms looking to list in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a related note, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui has voiced his confidence in the Hong Kong market, saying it has gone through many challenges before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, the minister said authorities will continue to enhance the market's safety, stability and foreseeability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a market operator, what we need to achieve is a credible market which both buyers and sellers will participate in, and it needs to operate smoothly," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As in the past, when even the macro environment, like what you said, is more complicated, it is important for us to stay calm and continue our work."

 Hong Kong, China's Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet made a triumphant return to international competition, securing their first Badminton Asia Championships mixed doubles title in Ningbo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duo, pairing up for the first time since December's World Tour Finals, overcame Japan's Hiroki Midorikawa and Natsu Saito in a thrilling final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong pair started strong, taking the opening game 21-15, but their Japanese world number 11 opponents rallied to claim the second game 21-17 to set up a decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was proved to be the SAR pair's day as they dominated the third game, winning eight consecutive points at one stage en route to a 21-13 win, lifting the Asian title for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks Hong Kong's second mixed doubles gold at the event after Reginald Lee and Chau Hoi-wah won it 11 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse came into the final riding high on confidence, having pulled off a semi-final upset over China's top-ranked Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday reaffirmed investors that Hong Kong will continue to welcome global business as a free port during "turbulent" times in global development.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking at the opening of InnoEX, a four-day innovation and technology trade event featuring more than 450 exhibitors from 13 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing guests in a speech, the financial minister acknowledged "a shifting global landscape marked by a daunting trade war and technological fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged businesses to adapt by finding new partners, exploring untapped markets, and adopting more flexible business models in what he called the "new normal".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also declared that it is in "Hong Kong's DNA" to establish new connections and forge new partnerships, noting the SAR is home to more than 4,700 startups, with 28 percent founded by overseas entrepreneurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rest assured that our free port status and free trade policy remain unshaken. We are firm in our commitment to the free flow of capital, goods, talent and information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the event, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong stressed that unilateral trade policies and protectionism means that technological cooperation will be more vital than ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we navigate an increasingly complex world with a looming revival of unilateralism and protectionism, it is essential that we continue to harness innovation and embrace collaborative spirit to sustain the competitive edge of the tech-driven economies while pushing the technological boundaries for the well-being of people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the city's strategic location as a gateway between mainland China and global markets, world-class infrastructure and a highly diverse talent pool – all of which, he said, will attract top innovators and investors from around the world.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The commander of the SAR's search and rescue team on Sunday said a consensus has been reached with their mainland counterparts to work together in future missions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's 51-member team returned home from Myanmar on Wednesday after assisting in search and rescue efforts following a devastating 7.9-magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after a Commercial Radio programme, deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the team, revealed that more than 10 mainland teams, including volunteers, were involved in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese rescue teams have about 300 members. If we have 300 people working together each time, the manpower, equipment and technology, as well as the efficiency, can be improved. We can also be well-organised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheu also recalled the moment when the SAR rescuers found a 52-year-old man alive, after he was was trapped in the rubble for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said local residents and officials in Myanmar cried and clapped their hands after the man was rescued, describing the scene as emotional.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, doctor Axel Siu, who's the Chief of Service (Accident and Emergency) at Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin Hospitals, recalled how the team battled the sweltering heat and swarms of mosquitoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they adjusted their strategy by sending smaller teams of two to three people to scout an area first, before deciding whether more personnel should be deployed there to conserve energy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials warned on Sunday that air pollution in certain areas of Hong Kong will reach "serious" levels, and urged vulnerable groups of people to reduce outdoor exposure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) explained that the level of suspended particulates has gone up since Saturday night due to a "dusty air stream associated with the northeast monsoon".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 10am Sunday, eight of the department's 18 monitoring stations recorded "very high" pollution levels, just one tier below the most severe "serious" classification in the Air Quality Health Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight districts are Eastern, Central and Western, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Po and North.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD noted that with the monsoon moderating gradually, winds were expected to weaken, hindering the dispersion of pollutants. The pollutant level is likely to remain "relatively high in the following one or two days", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children, the elderly and people with heart or respiratory illnesses were advised to cut down on time spent outside, while employers of outdoor workers were told to assess the risks and take preventive measures to protect the health of their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said schools should take appropriate measures to safeguard students' health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The northeast monsoon has also brought very dry conditions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point on Sunday morning, the relative humidity fell to 21 percent at the Observatory's Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters. The forecaster said that is the lowest mark ever recorded in April since the relevant monitoring equipment was set up in 1984.

    McIlroy puts in blistering third round to lead Masters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy raced out to the best start the Masters has seen in its 91-year history, with six straight 3s on his scorecard that shot him into the lead on Saturday and left him 18 holes away from that coveted green jacket and the career Grand Slam.
 <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy chipped in for eagle as part of his amazing start. And then he delivered another eagle late in the round as contenders were lining up behind him, a majestic 6-iron to 6 feet on the par-5 15th hole that carried him to a second straight 6-under 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was an awesome day and puts me in a great position going into tomorrow,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He led by two shots over a familiar foe — Bryson DeChambeau, who delivered some magic of his own with a 45-foot birdie putt to start his round and a putt from nearly 50 feet for birdie on the 18th hole that gave him a 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was DeChambeau who crushed McIlroy’s spirit last year at Pinehurst No. 2 by beating him at the US Open, stretching McIlroy's drought in the majors to more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also familiar to McIlroy was his position going into the final day at Augusta National .
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 14 years ago when McIlroy, a 21-year-old with long, curly locks and unlimited potential, took a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters. What followed was a meltdown that left him in tears when he shot 80.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I just have to stay firm and just stay in my own little world,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't had a better chance at that green jacket until this week, when he recovered from two double bogeys in the opening round and responded with rounds of 66-66.
  <br>
  <br>
  At stake on Sunday is a chance to become only the sixth player to capture all four professional majors, a feat last accomplished nearly 25 years ago by Tiger Woods at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners, who went from a five-shot deficit to one shot behind McIlroy in a span of three holes on this wild Saturday, closed with eight straight pars for a 70. He was in third place, four shots behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one else was closer than six shots of McIlroy. Justin Rose, who had a one-shot lead at the start of the day, shot 75 and was seven shots back. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States wants a nuclear agreement "as soon as possible", Iran said after rare talks on Saturday, as US President Donald Trump threatens military action if they fail to reach a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who briefly spoke face-to-face with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff during the indirect meeting in Oman, said the talks would resume next Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides," Araghchi told Iranian state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At today's meeting, I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on for ever," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the White House said: "The discussions were very positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oman's foreign minister acted as intermediary in the talks in Muscat, Iran said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the negotiators also spoke directly for "a few minutes", Iran's foreign ministry said. It said the talks were held "in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere".
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-term adversaries, who have not had diplomatic relations for more than 40 years, are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Araghchi, a seasoned diplomat and key architect of the 2015 accord, and Witkoff, a real estate magnate, led the delegations in the highest-level Iran-US nuclear talks since the previous accord's collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties were in "separate halls" and "conveying their views and positions to each other through the Omani foreign minister", Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process took place in a "friendly atmosphere", Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, weakened by Israel's pummelling of its allies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the United States, hand-in-glove with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, wants to stop Tehran from ever getting close to developing a nuclear bomb.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no visible signs of the high-level meeting at a luxury hotel in Muscat, the same venue where the 2015 agreement was struck when Barack Obama was US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal earlier that the US position starts with demanding that Iran completely dismantle its nuclear programme -- a view held by hardliners around Trump that few expect Iran to accept.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries," Witkoff told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponisation of your nuclear capability," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were revealed in a surprise announcement by Trump during a White House appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the talks began, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country. But they can't have a nuclear weapon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iran sought "a real and fair agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's meetings followed repeated threats of military action by both the United States and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it requires military, we're going to have military," Trump said Wednesday when asked what would happen if the talks fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 deal that Trump abandoned aimed to make it practically impossible for Iran to build an atomic weapon, while at the same time allowing it to pursue a civil nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which insists its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes, stepped up its activities after Trump withdrew from the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest International Atomic Energy Agency report said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, nearing the weapons grade of 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karim Bitar, a Middle East Studies lecturer at Sciences Po university in Paris, said the Iranian government's very survival could be at stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The one and only priority is the survival of the regime, and ideally, to get some oxygen, some sanctions relief, to get their economy going again, because the regime has become quite unpopular," he told AFP.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrated pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix, his 50th Formula One race, while dejected championship-leading teammate Lando Norris qualified sixth and said he had been "clueless on track".
 <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes rival George Russell was second fastest at the floodlit Sakhir desert circuit but was then handed a one-place grid drop, promoting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to the front row instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli collected a similar penalty, after Mercedes released their drivers too early from a red flag stoppage, and dropped to fifth while Alpine's Pierre Gasly moved up to fourth on the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've felt confident out there pretty much all weekend," said Piastri, who was also fastest in two out of three practice sessions and lapped with a best time of one minute 29.841 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Piastri, winner in China from pole, could become the first double winner of the season and looks set to slash the 13-point gap to Norris, who is only one clear of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said the Australian deserved his pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is amazing, as good as it has been all season which is strong. Just I have been off it all weekend," Norris told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why, just clueless on track at the minute. Just not quick enough, simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The only positive for Norris was having Verstappen end up in seventh place for Red Bull at a track where the four-times champion was utterly dominant last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he had been struggling with the brakes and lack of grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea where we will be in terms of race pace. We'll be in the middle of the pack so hopefully a bit of excitement," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Sainz qualified eighth for Williams, at a track where he was quickest in pre-season testing, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton ninth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time this season that both Red Bulls had reached the top 10 shootout, although they flirted with an early exit in Q1 and Q2 when they left it until the last minute to set a time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously as a driver you want more but considering what I had in practice, and it’s only my second race (for Red Bull), I’ll still take it," said Tsunoda, who replaced Liam Lawson after the opening two races.
  <br>
  <br>
  Esteban Ocon crashed his Haas in the second phase, triggering red flags after he careered backwards across the gravel into the barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman took his time clambering out and was taken away in the medical car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian rookie Jack Doohan qualified his Alpine 11th, his best session yet, and one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Albon failed to make it through the opening phase for the first time this season, the Williams driver qualifying only 16th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albon was then promoted to 15th when Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits while already taking part in a second phase he was then excluded from.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards said they had been informed of the violation too late to stop him progressing at Albon's expense.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hadjar's teammate Lawson had another difficult evening and was only 17th. (Reuters)

 US President Donald Trump's administration has granted exclusions from steep reciprocal tariffs to smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a notice to shippers, the US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes. The exclusions are retroactive to 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US CBP listed 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays. The notice did not provide an explanation for the move, but the late-night exclusion provides welcome relief to major technology firms such as Apple, Dell Technologies and many other importers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. (Reuters, AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin De Bruyne sparked Manchester City’s remarkable fightback from two goals down in a 5-2 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday that re-ignited his team’s Champions League qualification hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old De Bruyne curled a free kick in off the post to begin the comeback in the 33rd minute and had a hand in goals by Omar Marmoush and Mateo Kovacic in the first half. James McAtee added a fourth, off a pass from goalkeeper Ederson, who later came off injured before fellow academy product Nico O’Reilly wrapped up the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a display showing the enduring quality of De Bruyne, who announced last week he would be leaving City at the end of the season after 10 years at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injuries have affected the Belgium playmaker's impact in recent seasons but his class can still shine through, with his assist for Kovacic the 119th of his Premier League career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eberechi Eze and Chris Richards scored in the first 21 minutes for Palace to shock City into action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory lifted City into fourth place above Chelsea and Newcastle, who have games in hand in the race to secure England's five Champions League spots. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States and Iran opened high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Saturday, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if they fail to produce a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides entered "indirect" talks -- via an intermediary -- in the Omani capital Muscat, Iran's foreign ministry said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disagreement over the format indicated the task facing the long-term adversaries, who are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was leading the Iranian delegation while Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff headed the US team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our intention is to reach a fair and honourable agreement from an equal position," Araghchi said in a video posted by Iranian state TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, weakened by Israel's pummelling of its allies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the US, hand-in-glove with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, wants to stop Tehran from ever getting close to developing a nuclear bomb. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 69 people were killed this week in unusually intense thunderstorms across eastern India's Bihar state and in neighbouring Nepal, officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bihar disaster authorities said at least 61 people had died in strong thunder and lightning storms on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more people were killed in neighbouring Nepal, disaster officials said, blaming "lightning strikes" on Wednesday and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rain was forecast to hit Bihar again on Saturday, according to the local India Meteorological Department office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, experts warned that climate change was fuelling an alarming increase in deadly lightning strikes in India, killing nearly 1,900 people a year in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lightning caused 101,309 deaths between 1967 and 2020, with a sharp increase between 2010 and 2020, a team of researchers led by Fakir Mohan University in the eastern state of Odisha said. (AFP)
