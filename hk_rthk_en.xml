<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that massive overnight strikes on Gaza were "only the beginning" and that future negotiations with Hamas "will take place only under fire".
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across Gaza, according to its health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday evening that "Hamas has already felt the strength of our arm in the past 24 hours. And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli premier said in his address that "from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire," before adding: "Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has not responded militarily so far, and in a statement urged friendly countries to "pressure" the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was "fully coordinated" with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  A State Department spokesperson said that "Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones. (AFP)

    US releases final trove of Kennedy assassination files

<img alt="Documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are displayed after they were released. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796353_1_20250319084345.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US National Archives on Tuesday released the final batch of files related to the assassination of president John F Kennedy - a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump in January directing the unredacted release of the remaining files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother, former attorney general Robert F Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In accordance with President Donald Trump's directive... all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released," the Archives said in a statement on its website on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Archives has released millions of pages of records over the past decades relating to the assassination of then-president Kennedy in November 1963, but thousands of documents had been held back at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy scholars have said the documents that were still held by the archives were unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald was shot by a strip club owner, Jack Ruby, on November 24, 1963 - two days after the Kennedy assassination - while being moved to a county jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the records already released were raw intelligence, including scores of reports from FBI agents following up leads that led nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of what they contain was also previously known, such as that the communist-obsessed CIA cooked up several outlandish plots to murder Cuba's Fidel Castro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the documents follows an October 26, 1992 act of Congress which required that the unredacted assassination records held in the National Archives be released in full 25 years later. (AFP)

    Ohtani leads Dodgers to MLB season-opener win in Tokyo

<img alt="Ohtani shook off the nerves to deliver two crucial hits during the Dodgers' season-opening win. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796342_1_20250319070737.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani admitted he was "nervous" playing in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as the Los Angeles Dodgers started the new Major League Baseball season with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese baseball superstar delivered two important hits as the World Series champion Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in front of over 40,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ohtani, a national hero in Japan, said he needed time to feel his way into his first MLB regular-season game in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since I've been this nervous playing a game," the 30-year-old said. "It took me a couple of at-bats to get into it but I was glad that I was able to do well in the later part of the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The series has been eagerly anticipated for months in Japan and excitement was at fever pitch at the start of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the occasion left its mark on the normally ice-cool Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous, but one thing I did notice was how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem," Roberts said. "That was telling."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers' Japanese starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto struck out four batters in five innings to come out on top in his duel with Chicago counterpart Shota Imanaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time two Japanese starting pitchers had ever gone head to head on MLB's opening day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demeanour he has on the mound, even if he gives up a run he's still calm," Ohtani said of Yamamoto. "He was able to grow into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The action got underway after a Pokemon-themed opening ceremony that featured an appearance by Japanese world champion boxer Naoya Inoue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani stepped up to the plate to start the game but the first pitch whistled past him for a strike before he grounded out to first base.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs had taken a one-run lead by the time Ohtani came back to bat and he again failed to get a hit, lining out to second baseman Jon Berti. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their downward slide on Tuesday as worries over the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts added to unease over President Trump's aggressive trade agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to yield a ceasefire, prompting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pledge continued fighting in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel resumed bombing Gaza in the deadliest attack since a ceasefire came into effect on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices spent the entire session in the red on the first day of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 41,581.31.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.1 percent to 5,614.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.7 percent to 17,504.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had risen the last two days in a partial rebound from declines in recent weeks as mixed economic data and uncertainty about the Trump administration's trade policies spark talk of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The news of what's going on politically, it's still very uncertain," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "I don't think there's any new news so far this week that should make the market feel more encouraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides uncertainty over the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Cahill also pointed to unease over an April 2 deadline when the Trump administration is expected to announce a fresh litany of tariffs.

  Among individual companies, Nvidia fell 3.2 percent as chief executive Jensen Huang showcased cutting-edge chips for artificial intelligence at the company's annual developers conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google parent Alphabet fell 2.4 percent after the tech giant announced it will acquire cloud security platform Wiz for $32 billion, as it seeks to beef up its cloud computing business for the AI era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed on Wednesday is expected to maintain current interest rates, but the central bank's commentary will be scrutinized for its views on growth and inflation. (AFP)

    Nasa astronauts Wilmore and Williams splash down

<img alt="They arrived back on Earth nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the ISS. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796336_2_20250319063556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday with a soft splashdown off Florida's coast, nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the International Space Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their return caps a protracted space mission that was fraught with uncertainty and technical troubles and turned a rare instance of Nasa's contingency planning - and the latest failures of Boeing's Starliner - into a global spectacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams, two veteran Nasa astronauts and retired US Navy test pilots, had strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the orbiting laboratory of the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-person crew, formally part of Nasa's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 5:45 p.m. ET. Using Earth's atmosphere and two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa's live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astronaut pair had launched into space as Starliner's first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner's propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a Nasa decision last year to have them take a SpaceX craft back this year as part of the agency's crew rotation schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden "abandoned" them on the ISS for political reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is the United States' only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Wilmore and Williams threw its development future into uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the splashdown, the astronauts will be flown to their crew quarters at the space agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before Nasa flight surgeons approve they can go home to their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams, capping her third spaceflight, has tallied 608 cumulative days in space, the second most for any US astronaut after Peggy Whitson's 675 days. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko set the world record last year at 878 cumulative days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swept up in Nasa's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Wilmore and Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived, in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their replacements arrived on Friday night - four astronauts as part of Nasa's Crew-10 mission that briefly put the station's headcount at 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short," Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe Nasa's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about," he said. "Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams had been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts. Williams had performed two six-hour spacewalks for maintenance outside the ISS, including one with Wilmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ISS, about 254 miles (409 km) in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy managed primarily by the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams told reporters earlier this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," she said. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Djokovic-backed players union takes aim at the sport's governing bodies, the ATP and WTA. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796331_1_20250319053811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tennis union co-founded by Novak Djokovic announced a series of legal actions aimed at the sport's governing bodies, alleging "anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) said it was suing both tour organisers, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) were also named as defendants in a series of actions in the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the ATP and WTA responded by vowing to defend themselves against the claims with the men's tour saying the PTPA has "consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA was set up by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil in 2020. Some 20 players were named as part of at least one of the actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades," said the PTPA statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tennis is broken," said Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement listed alleged abuses they are targeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the defendants "colluded", "fixing prize money and suppressing player earnings" forcing "an unsustainable schedule" and exploiting players financially.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies show a "disregard for players" by making them "compete in 100-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, endure matches that ended at 3 am, and play with different and injury-inducing tennis balls".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA also cited image right ownership, sponsorship restrictions and the "draconian system of ranking points".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also complained that tennis violates player "privacy rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Players are subjected to invasive searches of personal devices, random middle-of-the-night drug tests, and interrogations without legal representation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ATP said that it was continuing to make change, with player input and hit back at the union.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. The ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans," the tour concluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA also defended their approach to the game and said that PTPA's action "is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course."

<div class="itemFullText">
 German lawmakers gave the green light on Tuesday for a colossal spending boost for defence and infrastructure pushed by chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz amid deep fears in Europe over the future strength of the transatlantic alliance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed an "XXL-sized" cash "bazooka" by German media – could pave the way for more than one trillion euros in spending over the next decade in Europe's top economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The historic parliament vote signalled a radical departure for a country famously reluctant to take on large state debt – or to spend heavily on the armed forces, given its dark World War II history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor after his CDU/CSU alliance won last month's elections, argued that dramatic steps are needed at a time of geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's war with Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  European countries have been further unsettled by US President Donald Trump's outreach to Russia and signals of an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to parliament, Merz cited Russia's "war of aggression against Europe" and said the funding boost would spell "the first major step towards a new European defence community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's centre-right alliance and their likely future coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have hammered out the package over recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would exempt defence spending above one percent of GDP from Germany's strict debt rules and set up a 500-billion-euro (US$545-billion) fund for infrastructure investments over 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short term, Berlin looked set to soon approve an additional three billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. (AFP)

    Putin, Trump fail to reach deal on full ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday on a halt in Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy targets – but fell far short of securing a full ceasefire in a highly anticipated phone call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was no agreement from the Russian president for Washington's proposed full 30-day ceasefire in Russia's war with its pro-Western neighbor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine energy targets for 30 days and that Putin had already given the order to his military. The White House said separately that the "leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has launched a series of devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the three-year-old war. According to the Kremlin statement, Ukraine – which has bombed multiple Russian oil installations – had also agreed to the truce on energy targets, although Kyiv had yet to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders agreed that broader truce talks would "begin immediately in the Middle East," the White House said in its statement, also citing a "huge upside" if Russia and the United States improve their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin statement said a "key condition" for peace would be ending Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military – a position that will alarm Kyiv and European capitals that have already accused Putin of stalling. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Despair mixed with anger in Kocani, North Macedonia on Tuesday in the wake of a horrific nightclub fire that left dozens dead and even more injured, prompting demands for justice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the town of just 30,000 people, the deaths of 59 people – most of them teenagers and young adults – touched almost every home, with the agony of losing so many young people cutting especially deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are a small place. We all know each other," Sasko Jordanov, a 38-year-old dentist in Kocani, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am a doctor and have many patients dead, children of friends and neighbours."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have children – their friends died. This is horrible," said a woman as she lit candles at a makeshift shrine, where others left flowers and messages of condolence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire rapidly spread as a crowd of young fans packed into Club Pulse to attend the performance by a popular hip-hop band, DNK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze was apparently started by fireworks onstage igniting the ceiling of the nightclub.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 500 people were crammed inside despite just 250 tickets being sold, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those killed were trampled as they rushed to the exits, while the roof was consumed with flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutor's office said the club had breached numerous fire regulations, including having insufficient extinguishers and emergency exits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said investigators had determined the club owner operated under a forged licence, and vowed to crackdown on corruption. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five primary school pupils who took part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill with gastroenteritis, adding to a string of similar cases in the past few weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday it was investigating the latest cluster involving pupils from SKH St Michael's Primary School in North Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five were part of a group of 70 students and teachers who visited Xi'an between March 11 and 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health authorities said one of the five developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis such as vomiting on the last day of the tour. Four others sitting nearby the pupil who first fell ill began showing similar symptoms two days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sought medical attention but none required hospitalisation, officials said, adding their symptoms matched that of a norovirus infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The centre's preliminary investigation results show that the cases are likely to be infected through person-to-person transmission or an environment contaminated by vomit," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of secondary school pupils have come down with gastroenteritis after visiting the mainland on exchange tours, with the government forming a task force to look into the recent outbreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has reminded schools that have upcoming exchange tours to learn about the latest information on disease prevention and control, a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the bureau's website on national education activities, it has urged schools to "avoid providing higher-risk food such as raw and cold food, siu mei and shellfish seafood when organising student exchange activities [on] the mainland".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also asked contactors of exchange programmes across the border who help to organise trips to stop supplying such dishes.

    'Funding cut won't affect non-local student tuition'

File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796300_1_20250318215610.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities on Tuesday stressed that plans to slash funding for universities does not translate to a rise in tuition fees for non-local students as a source of income.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had announced plans to reduce public university funding by HK$2.8 billion over the next three academic years.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, education minister Christine Choi was asked if universities would raise fees for non-local students because of the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said non-local students' tuition fee adjustments are not linked with the income of a university.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we increase the funding for universities, they will not lower the tuition for non-local students, so when non-local students come to Hong Kong to study – regardless of the change in our funding for universities – the tuition level is decided based on the cost of individual programmes," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of funding changes to publicly-financed universities, the institutions need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities would not be seriously affected with the move leaving them with around four months worth of reserves, Choi said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Tuesday said that Hamas had chosen war by refusing to release hostages, as Israel unleashed its most intense strikes since a ceasefire, killing more than 400 people, and vowed to continue fighting until all hostages are returned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that "Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hughes' statement comes as Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri said that the Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip were an attempt to force the group's "surrender", and called the United States "complicit" in the escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of the massacres committed by the occupation in Gaza is to undermine the ceasefire agreement and attempt to impose a surrender agreement, writing it in the blood of Gaza," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar said that his country had "no alternative" other than to resume military operations in Gaza after efforts to secure the release of hostages failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saar's comments come as relatives of the Israeli hostages accused the country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of sacrificing their loved ones by carrying out the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They called on supporters of the hostages to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem, warning that "military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them back safe and sound".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liran Berman is a brother of twin siblings who are being held hostage in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now my brothers are alive. My worst nightmare is to become a family of deceased and killed hostages. This is my worst nightmare right now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the British government has called on Israel and Hamas to implement their ceasefire agreement for Gaza in full, and the EU has called for an immediate end to the renewed violence in the strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Moscow has said it deeply regrets Israel's resumption of military operation in Gaza. (Agencies)

    F1 boss holds talks with Thailand on hosting GP

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One boss Stefano Domenicali held talks with Thailand's prime minister on Tuesday about possible plans to bring a grand prix to the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Italian ex-Ferrari boss who has just extended his contract to lead the sport until 2029, is keen to examine new markets as the sport soars in popularity, and Thailand has suggested it may be interested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of Formula One's 24-race schedule is locked in for several years, but gaps are set to open up and Domenicali suggested at the weekend that Thailand could be a contender to join the circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the talks, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand would move ahead with a feasibility study to examine the pros and cons of hosting F1 – including the costs and where the race would be run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not just about the honour of hosting the race, but also a significant opportunity to develop urban infrastructure, welcome tourists from around the world to Thailand and develop industry and service sectors," she posted on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's northeastern Buriram track has become a regular fixture on the MotoGP circuit, hosting the season-opening race earlier this month, but the kingdom has never hosted Formula 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Jirayu Houngsub said the prime minister told Domenicali that Thailand would work with F1 officials to see how a grand prix could work in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domenicali visited Bangkok in April last year for talks with then-prime minister Srettha Thavisin, who pitched his vision of bringing a race to the sprawling, traffic-clogged Thai capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said at the time they envisaged a street circuit, possibly around Bangkok's historic centre, as the kingdom looks to boost its image internationally through a host of "soft power" initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Thailand is not the only country knocking at F1's door – historic hosts France and Germany are seeking a return to the calendar, while the Turkish Grand Prix, last held in 2021, is also seen as a likely candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-Pacific region currently hosts four races – in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – while Thailand is represented on the grid by Alex Albon of Williams, who finished fifth in Melbourne. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday jailed the former boss of state-owned banking giant Everbright Group for bribery, state media said, the latest official to fall foul of President Xi Jinping's decade-long corruption crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced the investigation into Li Xiaopeng, the company's former Communist Party secretary and chairman, two years ago and brought him to trial in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV reported that a court in northeastern Heilongjiang found Li guilty of accepting bribes worth over 60 million yuan between 1994 and 2021.

  He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined six million yuan, CCTV said, adding that he received a lighter punishment for confessing his crimes and cooperating with authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The property and interest obtained through his bribes have been recovered... and turned over to the state treasury," CCTV said.
  <br>

  In December, former Everbright chairman Tang Shuangning was jailed for 12 years for embezzlement and bribery. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate has increased slightly as authorities warned about the "uncertainties" caused by US trade protection measures going forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the city's unemployment rate increased  by 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent in the three-month period ending February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate, however, stood steady at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 1,600 people lost their jobs, taking the total to 111,700 in the December-February period, while the total number of those underemployed dropped by some 2,300 to stand at 40,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate rises were mostly seen in the food and beverages, transport, construction and professional and business service sectors, excluding cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun noted there were "diverse movements" in terms of the jobless rates in various sectors but that the rates "generally stayed low."
  <br>
  <br>
  He cautioned that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term amidst continued economic expansion, though some businesses would be affected by the uncertainties stemming from US trade protection measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun's remarks came as the city's total employment number dropped by about 7,100 to more than 3.7 million, and total labour force decreased by about 5,400 to stand at 3.82 million last month.

    Hotter weather expected this year: Observatory

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Tuesday said residents can expect hotter weather this year due to the continuing impact of climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  It predicted that up to eight tropical cyclones will enter the city’s 500-kilometre warning radius from June or earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also said Hong Kong will be affected by rainstorms and localised heavy rain, despite predicting annual rainfall to be within the normal range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the temperatures in Hong Kong are on a rising trend in the past few years. In fact, in the last year, we have the highest wind temperature in Hong Kong. And it's a result of urbanisation and also the effect of climate change," said observatory director Chan Pak-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at 2024, the observatory noted that it was the warmest year recorded globally, and that Hong Kong also recorded 11 months that were warmer than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.3 and 22.8 degrees Celsius respectively, which were the highest and second highest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also pointed out that sudden changes in the weather like on March 15, when it issued a hail warning and the first Amber rainstorm warning signal this year, are common in spring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said people should take note of push notifications from the observatory's mobile app to get immediate weather updates.

 Markets rose 2.2 percent on Tuesday, led by continued buying of mainland Chinese tech firms.

    ERB to offer new courses to highly educated trainees

<img alt="The Employees Retraining Board says it has been actively promoting skills-based training. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796244_1_20250318161327.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) on Tuesday said it will step up collaboration with tertiary institutions this year to provide advanced courses for people with a higher education level.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address last year plans to reform the ERB, and the board has since January expanded its service targets to include the entire local labour workforce, disregarding their education level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said since it expanded its coverage, about 4,000 people with a bachelor's or a higher-level degree have applied for ERB courses, making up about 12 percent of the total number of applications it received over the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Yu Pang-chun said the ERB has been actively promoting skills-based training to help people acquire new skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The ERB] strengthens its collaboration with tertiary institutions, broadens its network of training bodies to include institutions with extensive training experience, thereby supporting trainees with different educational attainments and background to pursue lifelong learning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said it will work with the Hang Seng University, the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education, and the Education University's Institute of Professional and Vocational Education and Lifelong Learning this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its executive director Byron Ng said the advanced courses may include the application of artificial intelligence models in various industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the expansion of our service targets, including the higher educated working population, more higher educated trainees can benefit from our courses, which include, of course, digital and technological courses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board also revealed it expects to provide about 165,000 training places in 2025-26, and that it will submit its long-term plan to the government in the fourth quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Tuesday said 22 people have been arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes and helping intermediaries defraud banks of mortgage referral fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involved over 200 mortgage applications and more than HK$2 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those arrested, aged between 31 and 58, include 18 frontline staff from 10 local banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, a married couple who worked at banks allegedly received HK$600,000 in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grace Yee, a principal investigator with the Independent Commission Against Corruption, explained how the fraud scheme worked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the investigation, the ICAC found that frontline bank staff had accepted bribes from intermediaries by secretly slipping referral forms into the mortgage loan documents that borrowers needed to sign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made it appear as if customers who were directly applying for mortgage loans had come through intermediary referrals, allowing the intermediaries to fraudulently obtain referral fees from the banks."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yee said she believes the case only involves a few bad apples at individual banks and that Hong Kong's banking sector as a whole remains clean.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China women’s rugby team on Tuesday said they are ready to take their game to the next level at the upcoming Rugby Sevens, to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Natasha Olson-Thorne was brimming with excitement over playing in front of the home crowd in Kai Tak Stadium, telling RTHK her team is keen to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wants to build on their success last year when they were runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition, a tournament among Asian teams which runs alongside the showpiece Sevens event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just got to take it in," Olson-Thorne said during an open training session. "Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressure is something that we should enjoy, because we don't often get the chance to perform in front of our home crowd, friends, and family," she added. "So taking that and knowing they're behind us, that's a really important feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  Olson-Thorne, who made her international Sevens debut during the 2011 Hong Kong Women's Sevens, also said intense training sessions ahead of this year's competition has strengthened the bond between her teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been working on our physicality in the contact area, and also learning to trust ourselves and the team more," she explained. "It's brought us closer together and we're excited to showcase what we've learnt come the Hong Kong Sevens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chloe Chan, who late last year was selected as the new co-captain of the women's side, said she hopes to encourage her teammates to play to their strengths on the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The thing about our team is that we're all so different," said Chan. "We've got speed, we've got physical players, and bigger players who can help us build that foundation in our structure. That's the one thing we know we're good at – using each other's strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added she will do what she can to lead her teammates on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not a very vocal leader, so I don't really like to talk that much. But I like to think I can lead by example, so I'm hoping I can do my job the right way and build each other to do the same thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Andy Vilk, meanwhile, said he is looking forward to feeding off last year's energy, and said this year's Sevens will be a "unique experience" for his young squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year was a fantastic experience. It's an important experience for the players and their growth and to be able to play with that kind of pressure. We need to understand how we're going to embrace that pressure and use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vilk – who took up coaching duties just weeks before the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou – said his side will be ready to take on powerhouses Thailand and Kazakhstan in the Melrose Claymores, when the highly-anticipated three-day sporting event kicks off on March 28.

    Vaping devices ban sought to stop space oil drug use

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health on Tuesday called on the government to ban the possession of e-cigarettes devices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Henry Tong said the situation with teenagers taking the space oil drug is worrying.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said teachers and parents find it hard to spot students taking the drug, which is usually inhaled through vaping devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that e-cigarettes make it easy to easy to hide abuse of the drug as, unlike with the distinctive smell of traditional cigarettes, the space oil drug offers different flavours such as fruit and chocolate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the government should proceed with all haste in implementing the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said 300 people reportedly took the drug last year, with 75 percent of them aged below 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a greater incidence of the cases in North district, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Sing-chin, chairman of Tuen Mun District Secondary School Heads Association, said on the same show that the number of reported space oil cases in these places might be due to their higher number of students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the participation rate for the "Healthy School Programme," an anti-drug education initiative that comes with voluntary drug testing, varies among districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, while more than 90 percent of the schools in Tai Po have already signed up for the scheme, only a few schools among the dozens in other districts have done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK there might be a reason why some schools decided not to join the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that maybe for schools, anti-drug education might not be a high priority. Because actually there were only a very low number of students taking drugs. It's a minority. Therefore, teachers' time and efforts might be on education," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, we care a lot about students' mental health and emotions, and they might focus more on these areas."

  Ng emphasised that rather than mainly relying on tests to tell if a student is on drug, the priority should be on teachers' observation and peer support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday that the Legislative Council general election will be held on December 7.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said three months prior to the poll, a by-election would be held for the Election Committee tasked with nominating and electing 40 Legco members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that of the 967 elected members in the 1,500-strong committee, there are 90 vacancies and there's a need to fill them in a by-election set for September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said electoral officials will provide more details later, such as the nomination periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have directed the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau to prepare for the elections, and collaborate closely with the Electoral Affairs Commission," Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Electoral Affairs Commission will work on vote counting, data systems and security, among other tasks, to ensure everything goes smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco election will return 90 lawmakers for the eighth legislature since the SAR's establishment, and it's the second poll since the national legislature passed a decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system four years ago.

    'Changes in checkpoints for drivers need coordination'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said any changes to cross-border driving arrangements must prioritise traffic management and require careful coordination with mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, cross-boundary private cars are only allowed to use designated border checkpoints for entry and exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice-chairman and former chief executive CY Leung called the arrangement unreasonable, saying such vehicles should be able to use different ports to travel in and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters the government must ensure smooth traffic flow at all checkpoints when it considers any changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One consideration that we have to take into account is that if there aren't any regulations or controls, some of the ports that provide more convenience may see serious traffic congestion and the congestion may affect the urban areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said any changes would require cooperation between local and mainland authorities since cross-border control points involve traffic management on both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2023, some private cars and cross-boundary coaches have been permitted to use different control points, Lee noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said members of his administration would continue to work with their mainland counterparts and study potential new arrangements that align with people's expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee said concerns expressed over CK Hutchison’s deal to sell its global port operations to a US consortium are worthy of "serious attention," saying foreign governments should provide a fair environment for deal-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment on Tuesday when asked about Beijing officials re-posting of articles criticising the deal, which also included the selling of the firm's operations at the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale came after US President Donald Trump reportedly asked the military to draw up plans to ensure American access of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said foreign governments should ensure that global trades are made in a fair manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CK Hutchison and CK Assets announced that they will not hold press and investors briefings on Thursday, when they release annual results.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A special admission scheme that makes it easier for guests from 10 Asean nations to visit Hong Kong will start on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee has announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Such guests include those who have made significant economic contributions to the SAR or been invited to important events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can enjoy fast immigration clearance through self-service gates and have a special counter to handle their visas and paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can stay for two or more months and enjoy these benefits for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the move is aimed at strengthening the city's ties with Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now this special scheme will facilitate the attendance of talent from Asean member states in our important meetings and facilitate their investments in Hong Kong, thus encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a springboard to go global," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean is one of Hong Kong's closest economic partners and the city's second-largest trading partner in merchandise trade, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive said the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Department of Justice will start sending out invitations to business and legal leaders.

    Scores dead in new Israeli strikes against Hamas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched new strikes against Hamas on Tuesday and promised "increasing military force" after talks on further hostage releases stalled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 200 people were killed and another 150 were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he instructed the military to take "strong action" against Hamas in Gaza in response to the group's refusal to release hostages and rejection of all ceasefire proposals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength," the prime minister's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month long war where dozens of hostages were released for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior Hamas official accused Israel of unilaterally overturning the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hamas said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin "Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza, a building in Gaza City, and targets in Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab mediators, backed by the United States, haven't been able to hammer out differences between the two warring parties in talks held over the past two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing on Tuesday called for steps to prevent a "humanitarian disaster" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is highly concerned about the current situation between Israel and Palestine," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, calling for the parties to "avoid any actions that could lead to an escalation of the situation, and prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster". (Agencies)

 Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, who has been found liable of sexual assault, met Donald Trump during a Saint Patrick's Day visit on Monday during which he lashed out at illegal immigration in Ireland.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Ireland is at the cusp of potentially losing its Irishness," said McGregor during an appearance in the White House briefing room alongside the US president's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country," added the fighter, wearing a green business suit to mark Saint Patrick's Day, the centuries-old celebration of his homeland.

  Trump later hosted the 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star - whom he said last week was his favourite Irishman - in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor posed for a picture with his arm around Trump's shoulder as the president sat at his desk, and for another with tech tycoon and powerful Trump advisor Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla billionaire Musk previously backed McGregor when he spoke in the past about a possible presidential bid in Ireland. Musk has recently spoken out in support of a number of anti-immigration parties in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your work ethic is inspiring," McGregor told Trump, according to footage posted by an aide to the US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yours is too, you're fantastic," replied Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor had earlier said he would be "listening" to Trump on immigration - one of the US president's main focus areas as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people without proper documentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on Saint Patrick's Day," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor's comments earned swift pushback from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, who met with Trump last week in the White House and received a dressing down over trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland," the premier posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a sport that combines various combat techniques, and can be extremely violent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been gaining popularity, particularly as Trump campaigned in 2024 with stars and promoters of the UFC series that is popular with many male voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicknamed "The Notorious," McGregor is one of the biggest stars in UFC, the most famous and lucrative MMA league. He is known for his aggressive, provocative temperament and noted for occasional anti-immigration outbursts.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 2024 the fighter was ordered by an Irish court to pay damages to a woman who claimed that McGregor "brutally raped and battered" her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGregor claimed they had consensual sex.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the Irishman was sued in a US court in January, accused of sexual assault at an NBA game in Miami in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was meanwhile ordered by a New York jury in a civil trial in 2023 to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict, which was upheld in December 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months aboard the International Space Station, a pair of astronauts are finally set to depart for Earth early Tuesday, ending a prolonged mission that has captivated global attention.
 <br>
  <br>
  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams flew to the orbital lab in June last year, on what was supposed to be a days-long roundtrip to test out Boeing's Starliner on its first crewed flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly them back, instead returning empty without more major problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-Navy pilots Wilmore and Williams, 62 and 59 respectively, were instead re-assigned to the Nasa-SpaceX Crew-9 mission, which saw a Dragon spacecraft fly to the ISS last September with a team of two, rather than the usual four, to make room for the "stranded" pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, early Sunday, a relief team called Crew-10 docked with the station, their arrival met with broad smiles and hugs as they floated through the hatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crew-10's arrival clears the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with American Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.
  <br>
  <br>
  If all goes smoothly, the Dragon craft will deploy its parachutes off the coast of Florida for an ocean splashdown, where a recovery vessel will retrieve the crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams' stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed. (AFP)

    Indonesia to repatriate hundreds of scam workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 500 Indonesians freed from online scam centres in Myanmar are expected to be repatriated via Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cyberscam operations, which have thrived in Myanmar's lawless border areas for several years, lure foreign workers with promises of high-paying jobs but hold them hostage and force them to commit online fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed in recent weeks, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid temporary holding camps on the border between Myanmar and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  400 Indonesian nationals will return home on Tuesday and around 160 are to come back on Wednesday, Judha Nugraha, the director of citizen protection at Indonesia's foreign ministry, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  They would come back on three flights from Bangkok after crossing into Thailand from Myanmar, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesian authorities already repatriated 140 nationals from Myanmar via Thailand last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down on the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Indonesians have been enticed abroad in recent years to other Southeast Asian countries for better-paying jobs, only to end up in the hands of transnational scam operators.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 2020 and September last year, Jakarta repatriated more than 4,700 Indonesians entangled in online scam operations from countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, according to foreign ministry data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations estimates that as many as 120,000 people - many of them Chinese men - may be working in Myanmar scam centres against their will. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796176_1_20250318084916.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

    Starbucks ordered to pay US$50m for hot tea spill

<img alt="A spokesperson for the coffee chain said the company would appeal the award. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796175_1_20250318083745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Starbucks has been ordered to pay US$50 million to a customer who was burned when hot tea spilled on his lap at a California drive-through.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Michael Garcia said the server who handed him three super-sized drinks in February 2020 did not push one of them into the cardboard cupholder properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  When he took the tray, the drink tipped over, "causing third degree burns to his penis, groin, and inner thighs," according to a statement from Trial Lawyers for Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a hospitalisation and multiple skin grafts, Michael has lived for five years with the disfigurement, pain, dysfunction, and psychological harm caused by the burns."
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which specialises in no-win-no-fee claims, said Starbucks had denied responsibility for Garcia's suffering, but before a jury trial had offered to settle for US$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the coffee giant balked at the demand for a public apology and a change in policy that Garcia wanted, so the case went to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Los Angeles on Friday awarded him US$50 million, a figure his attorneys said would eventually cost Starbucks more than US$60 million once pre-judgement interest, costs and attorneys' fees are added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starbucks Corporation consistently denied responsibility for five years, all the way up to and through trial, and attempted to escape responsibility," the lawyers' statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trial was a perfect example of frivolous defences and victim-blaming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud of Michael for standing up for himself and having the courage to tell his story."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company would appeal the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sympathise with Mr Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive," Jaci Anderson, director of corporate communications, said in a statement to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case is redolent of a 1994 landmark legal action against McDonald's in New Mexico, when 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded over US$2.8 million after spilling hot coffee on herself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the award was reduced on appeal, the Liebeck case became a touchstone issue in US tort reform, and was often mocked as an example of how readily Americans resort to the law. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi will miss two World Cup qualifiers after he was left out of the Argentina squad for games against Uruguay and Brazil because he reportedly suffered an injury in a club game.
 <br>
  <br>
  After missing three games for his club, Inter Miami, at the start of March with a pulled muscle, the 37-year-old Messi returned with a goal off the bench in a Concacaf Champions Cup win. He played a full 90 minutes and scored again in an MLS win in Atlanta on Sunday but, Argentinian media reported, then felt muscle discomfort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, the defending World Cup champions, can ensure qualification for next year's tournament in their two games on the current international group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They lead the 10-team South American qualifying group by five points from Uruguay and visit Montevideo on Friday before hosting Brazil in Buenos Aires on March 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams qualify directly for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The seventh-placed team is currently Bolivia with 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 12 rounds, Messi is the top scorer in the competition with six goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina are also without injured Roma striker Paulo Dybala and River Plate full-back Paulo Montiel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, will be without 33-year-old Neymar, who has suffered a thigh injury and has had to postpone his return to the national team, who are fifth, seven points behind Argentina. (AFP)

    Carney says Canada must reduce reliance on US

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks during a bilateral meeting with Britain's Prime Minister. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796162_1_20250318063858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Monday warned his country must reduce its reliance on the United States and would turn towards its "reliable" European allies instead on his first trip abroad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carney's transatlantic visit to British leader Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron came after US President Donald Trump suggested his country could become part of the United States and threatened its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After succeeding Justin Trudeau last week, Carney conspicuously chose key European powers France and the United Kingdom, rather than the United States, for his first trip abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer in London, Carney told journalists his country "must diversify" its trade and security ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What is clear is that our trade and our security relations are too reliant on the United States. We must diversify," the former Bank of England governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's one of the reasons for which my first visit is to Paris and London."
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining their "shared values" and "shared king", Starmer thanked Carney for his "approach to Ukraine", two days after the Canadian leader took part in a video conference on shoring up support for Kyiv hosted by his UK counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's King Charles -- who is also head of state in Canada -- earlier welcomed Carney for talks at Buckingham Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Gavin Grey said the king would have to play delicate balancing act between supporting Carney but also being cordial to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He [Trump] has described King Charles in very, very glowing terms... so the British are very keen to use that, they are very keen to get a trade deal with America, at least some form of a trade deal, and get that expedited," Grey explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the king at the same time wanted to make it absolutely clear, in the coded world in which the king has to live -- he can't take sides, he can't offer political advice out loud -- but he wanted to make it clear that he was very supportive of Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney had travelled to the British capital after meeting France's President Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing Canada as the "most European of non-European countries", Carney said his nation needed to boost ties with European allies like France while trying to retain positive relations with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney faces threats on three fronts: a trade war with Washington, Trump's threats to annex his country and looming elections at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's imposition of an escalating raft of import tariffs on Canadian goods has threatened to trigger a recession, and his scorn for Canadian sovereignty sent jitters through the former ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a large majority of Canadian voters reject Trump's argument that their country would be better off as the "51st state of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trade war is a threat to the economy of the vast country of 41 million people, which has long enjoyed a close US partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, France and Britain are among the Nato members that have maintained strong support for Ukraine's beleaguered government and military since Russia's all-out attack in February 2022, even as Trump's US administration has pushed Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  London and Paris are putting together plans for a coalition security force in Ukraine and looking for allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and France want a "solid and lasting peace, accompanied by robust guarantees that will protect Ukraine against any further Russian aggression," Macron said alongside Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is in this spirit that we will... continue to demand clear commitments from Russia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney told Macron, who also took part in Saturday's call hosted by Starmer on Ukraine, that both nations stood for "sovereignty".
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is Canada's third-largest trading partner and France its eleventh at a time when Trump's tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures are threatening trade with its huge southern neighbour -- destination of three-quarters of Canada's exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada also has a "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement" with the European Union, which includes France.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now likewise includes Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first speech as prime minister, Carney said: "Security is a priority for this government... as is diversifying our trading and commercial relationships, of course, with both Europe and the United Kingdom."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for the second straight day on Monday following better US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve decision later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales for February showed a 0.2 percent increase from the previous month, less than the 0.7 percent expected by analysts, but a step above January's 1.2 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data was good enough to keep alive the market's momentum from Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've priced in a lot of the concerns on the trade war," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,841.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,675.12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 17,808.66.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks have been in retreat in recent weeks as President Donald Trump has announced myriad trade actions, implementing some tariffs and delaying other levies in a process that has left markets guessing and generated talk of a possible recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be pressed on whether uncertainty over tariffs has dimmed the US economic outlook at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development trimmed its growth forecast for the United States, citing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, PepsiCo rose 1.8 percent after announcing it will acquire the low-sugar soda brand Poppi for about US$1.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel jumped 6.8 percent on optimism about the chip company's prospects after it last week named tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach has announced that boxing is set to be among the sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after a new governing body is selected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bach said the IOC's Executive Board approved including boxing on the 2028 programme after his organisation recognised World Boxing to oversee the sport at the Olympics, ending years of divisions over the way the sport is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision still needs to be rubber-stamped by a full IOC Session of about 100 members later this week, but that is expected to be a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC stepped in to organise the boxing tournaments at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Olympics last year after breaking with the Russian-led International Boxing Association over financial, governance and ethical concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bach had warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and "reliable" international partner if it wanted to be included at the 2028 Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the IOC provisionally recognised World Boxing as the body to oversee the sport at future Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very confident that the session will approve it so that all the boxers of the world then have certainty that they can participate in the Olympic Games LA 2028 if their national federation is recognised by World Boxing," Bach said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  IOC members will elect Bach's successor on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front-runners in the field of seven candidates are IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe and former Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe. (AFP)

    Major rallies in Yemen after deadly US strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, the Iran-backed rebels' Al-Masirah TV showed, two days after US attacks that left dozens dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting "Death to America, death to Israel", at a huge protest in the capital Sanaa, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations were called by the rebel group's leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital, seized by the Houthis in 2014, giant Yemeni and Palestinian flags punctuated a sea of demonstrators at Al-Sabeen Square, the site of weekly protests throughout the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yemen will never back down -- we defy the Americans, we defy the Zionists," said a man shouting slogans to the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifty-three people died and 98 were wounded in Saturday's US attacks on Sanaa and other areas, according to the Houthi health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump ordered the attacks following months of Houthi attacks on the vital Red Sea maritime trade route, despite a pause since Gaza's ceasefire started in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, the rebels claimed to have twice attacked a US aircraft carrier group within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis, part of Iran's "axis of resistance" against the US and Israel, launched scores of drone and missile attacks on passing ships and Israeli territory during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. (AFP)

    McIlroy wins second Players Championship title

<img alt="The win was McIlroy's second in his career at the annual PGA Tour competiton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796153_1_20250318053122.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy cruised to a St. Patrick's Day victory at the Players Championship after defeating J.J. Spaun in a playoff at TPC Sawgrass in Florida.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-time major champion completed the three-hole shoot-out in one over par, while Spaun's challenge wilted after a disastrous triple-bogey on the second playoff hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the third time I've won on St. Patrick's Day, so it's been a good luck charm for me," McIlroy said after sealing the second Players Championship of his career and 28th PGA Tour title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky enough to do enough to get it done, but unbelievably proud and happy to win my second Players. It's really nice," McIlroy added. "I went home last night thinking 'I should have had this.' But I went home and reset, didn't have a great night's sleep, but was lucky enough to get it done."
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy had finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with Spaun following Sunday's storm-hit final round after failing to hold on to a three-shot lead with five holes to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after returning to the course on Monday in bright, breezy conditions, there was no sign of a repeat of the late stumble by McIlroy on Sunday that had allowed Spaun to force his way into the first playoff of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy struck first on the opening playoff hole, the par-five 16th, crushing a 336-yard drive straight down the fairway before reaching the green in two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun meanwhile looked out of sorts from the get-go, finding the fairway rough off the tee before landing his second shot into the greenside bunker.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy failed to make his 33-foot eagle putt but calmly rolled in an awkward five-footer for birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, whose recovery out of the bunker left him with a long, unsuccessful birdie putt, could only par.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that early wobble, things got worse for Spaun at the par-three 17th island hole, with the American plunging his tee-shot into the water behind the green.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun then missed a long 10-foot putt for double bogey and eventually finished with a triple-bogey six.
  <br>
  <br>
  While McIlroy missed his birdie chance and a 10-footer to save par, his bogey four still left him three shots clear heading to the 18th. McIlroy's tee-shot on the last went well wide of the right fairway, but Spaun was unable to exert pressure, also going wide of the fairway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players reached the green in three and missed their par putts. McIlroy coolly tapped in for bogey to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy's win marked the second title of the season for the Northern Irishman as he build towards the Masters in Augusta next month – the only major missing from his collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy said his early season form was a reward for the hard work he has put in over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've worked really hard – I feel like I'm a way more complete player than I was a few years ago," McIlroy told NBC. "I feel like I can play in all conditions and anything that comes my way. Really happy that I was able to get it done today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, meanwhile, was left reflecting on a disappointing outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard not to feel discouraged a little bit, but nothing but positives," Spaun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putting myself in contention and giving myself a chance to win in a playoff – if someone had told me that would happen at the start of the week I would totally have taken it," he added. "Hopefully I can just learn from this and get it done next time." (AFP)

 RTHK has been granted free broadcasting rights for a documentary that explores the world of giant pandas and the nation's dedicated conservation efforts to protect these beloved creatures.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a forum at the Hong Kong International Film and TV Market (FILMART), RTHK received the rights for "The Panda Adventure" from Sichuan Radio and Television and Beijing Radio and Television Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The programme premiered in the mainland last December, garnering widespread attention," an RTHK spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Professionally produced, the documentary features various locations across Giant Panda Bases and major areas of the Giant Panda National Park, showcasing the evolution and survival wisdom of giant pandas as well as the achievements of national conservation efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is set to show the documentary in April.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a gastroenteritis cluster among secondary students who participated in an exchange tour to Xiamen last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The latest cluster involves six secondary students who were part of a group of 36 teachers and students from a secondary school in the Kwun Tong district.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exchange tour took place between March 13 and 15, during which the six students started developing symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them sought medical attention in Xiamen, and none were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that all six affected persons had not consumed any common food items other than the group meals and had no other common exposure history in Hong Kong prior to their departure," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hence, at this stage, the CHP could not rule out the possibility that the cases were infected by consuming contaminated food."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP is investigating the source of the outbreak and has collected stool specimens for testing, while also coordinating with mainland health authorities regarding the implicated restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said it has instructed organising institutions to stop using the affected dining venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also reminded all organisers to immediately request that restaurants serving group meals refrain from offering high-risk foods like raw foods as well as cooked shellfish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also said that that all participants of the tour have returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the CHP said that three more students have developed gastroenteritis symptoms following an exchange tour to Shaoguan earlier this month, raising the total number of students and teachers affected to 55.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday it received three proposals for establishing the city’s third medical institution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposals were submitted by Baptist University, Polytechnic University and the University of Science and Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said that the Task Group on New Medical School will evaluate the proposals according to the devised parameters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Task Group earlier agreed to adopt a holistic and comprehensive approach for evaluating the proposals submitted by universities from various perspectives, in accordance with the 10 key parameters set (including innovative strategic positioning, curriculum structure and assessment methodologies, and financial sustainability)," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expert advisors and other members of the Task Group will conduct an in-depth evaluation of the proposals in their respective areas of expertise."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group added that interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said that the evaluation process is expected to conclude within the year, with a recommendation to the government on the proposal best suited to train medical professionals and support Hong Kong’s development as an international hub for medical training, research and innovation.

  Officers said a 52-year-old man was attacked by two men on Lai Wo Lane. He was later certified dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police raided a residential building in Mong Kok on Monday afternoon looking for the two assailants, but no arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters later in the day, superintendent Li Muk-yik said a 76-year-old man and his 47-year-old son were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the pair planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of them have a triad background. Police believe that the victim had serious disputes with the two over money," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are also looking for a suspected lookout at the scene, who is believed to have fled to the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 28-year-old girlfriend was taken into custody for allegedly assisting offenders and misleading officers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Hong Kong's richest people, Henderson Land founder Lee Shau-kee, has died at the age of 97.
 <br>
  <br>
  The property firm announced that Lee passed away peacefully on Monday evening surrounded by his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born into a small merchant's family in Guangdong province in 1928, he moved to Hong Kong in 1948 where he built his business empire and became one of the city's property tycoons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee started his career in currency and gold trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became friends with prominent businessmen Kwok Tak-seng and Fung King-hey. Dubbed the "Three Musketeers", they founded Sun Hung Kai Properties in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee later left Sun Hung Kai Properties and founded Henderson Land in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson grew quickly to become one of Hong Kong's biggest developers, with a land bank currently totalling about 20 million square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  His business empire also expanded beyond real estate, which includes Hong Kong and China Gas Company, or Towngas, and the Hong Kong Ferry Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee headed Henderson Land until 2019, when he handed over the reins to his sons Peter and Martin, as joint chairmen and managing directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Forbes, the tycoon had a net worth of about US$30 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affectionately known as "Uncle Four" for being the fourth child in his family, Lee was also renowned for his philanthropy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, he donated huge sums for scholarships as well as capital and education projects in Hong Kong and across China.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of his best-known mottos was "success isn't just about making money, but knowing how to spend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee offered his condolences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called Lee Shau-kee an outstanding business leader and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, as well as its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson Land said announcements on funeral arrangements will be made later.

 Belgium and Rwanda have announced the expulsion of each other's diplomats, as relations deteriorated over allegations about their respective roles in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kigali said it was severing diplomatic relations and giving Belgian diplomats 48 hours to leave the East African country, accusing Brussels of "using lies and manipulation to secure an unjustified hostile opinion of Rwanda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgium's foreign affairs minister Maxime Prevot said the move was "disproportionate and shows that when we disagree with Rwanda they prefer not to engage in dialogue." Brussels will reciprocate by declaring Rwandan diplomats persona non grata, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  African leaders have been trying to establish a lasting ceasefire in Congo, where the Rwandan government is accused of supporting an offensive by M23 rebels in eastern Congo. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Monday held talks with MTR Corporation officials as the railway company looks into allowing pets on trains.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty groups under the Animal Welfare Advocacy Alliance, together with DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, made suggestions, such as a requirement for carrier bags for pets to be used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other suggestions include allowing pets on board only during non-peak hours in the initial stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of them are concerned about odour issues. We also told the MTR officials to discuss and obtain advice from veterinarians and other professionals because they need to carry out investigations on the suitability of the ventilation system in Hong Kong," said Animal Rights And Welfare Association founder Susan Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, the MTRC also needs to explore the need for stronger ventilation systems within the platforms," she said, citing the importance of balancing the rights of pets and their owners on the one hand and other commuters on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  District councillor Corey Lau said regulations were also needed for pets and their owners using the trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some penalties we have suggested, not just fines but also the possibility of whether pet owners who do not follow regulations may be banned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that allowing pets on trains will be a milestone in turning Hong Kong into a pet-friendly city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the railway company said it is committed to providing safe, reliable and comfortable railway services, and will consider and balance different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will further communicate with various stakeholders.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in February.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit drama series "My Love from the Star" and "Queen of Tears" has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress' relatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible," the company said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Soo-hyun's agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-ron's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won, or HK$3.75 million, in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun. (Reuters)

 Police on Monday raided a building in Mong Kok, with sources saying the operation was linked to a murder case in Fo Tan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 52-year-old man was killed on Sunday after he was attacked by two knife-wielding men on Lai Wo Lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers cordoned off King Hing Building at the junction of Argyle Street and Fa Yuen Street on Monday afternoon, in what's believed to be part of an investigation into the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The building reopened later in the afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not say if any arrests were made.

    Mt Fuji entry fee set for hikers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hikers attempting any of Mount Fuji's four main trails will be charged an entry fee of 4,000 yen from this summer, after local authorities passed a bill on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A record influx of foreign tourists to Japan has sparked alarm about overcrowding on the nation's highest mountain, a once-peaceful pilgrimage site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Yamanashi region, home to Mount Fuji, introduced a 2,000 yen entry fee plus an optional donation for the active volcano's most popular hiking route, the Yoshida Trail.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cap on daily entries and online reservations were also brought in on that trail by officials concerned about safety and environmental damage on Fuji's majestic slopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yoshida Trail fee will be doubled for this year's July-September climbing season, while neighbouring Shizuoka region passed a bill on Monday to also charge 4,000 yen for its three trails, which were previously free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks in part to the new restrictions, the number of climbers who tackled Mount Fuji declined to 204,316 last year, from 221,322 in 2023, environment ministry data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although climber numbers continue to be eclipsed by pre-pandemic levels, "200,000 hikers is still huge," said Natsuko Sodeyama, a Shizuoka prefecture official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no other mountain in Japan that attracts that many people in the span of just over two months. So some restrictions are necessary to ensure their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mount Fuji is covered in snow for most of the year, but during the summer hiking season many trudge up its steep, rocky slopes through the night to see the sunrise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symmetrical mountain has been immortalised in countless artworks, including Hokusai's "Great Wave". It last erupted around 300 years ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump says he plans to speak to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the war in Ukraine, adding discussions are already ongoing about "dividing up certain assets" between the warring parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials had expressed optimism on Sunday that a Ukraine-Russia ceasefire deal could be reached in weeks after Washington proposed a halt in fighting in the three-year war after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Kyiv accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we'll be talking about land... we'll be talking about power plants," Trump said aboard Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington and Kyiv's European allies are pressing Moscow to accept a halt in the fighting, but Putin has given no clear answer – instead listing a string of conditions and raising "serious questions" over the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy for the conflict, Steve Witkoff, who met for several hours with Putin days ago, told CNN that he thinks "the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, he added, "really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday accused the Kremlin of not wanting to end the war. He warned that Moscow wanted to first "improve their situation on the battlefield" before agreeing to any ceasefire. (AFP)

    Philippines Senate to probe Duterte handover

<img alt="Imee Marcos is the one who set the wheels in motion for the senate probe.  Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796060_1_20250317151836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippine Senate said on Monday it will conduct a formal probe of ex-president Rodrigo Duterte's arrest and swift handover last week to the International Criminal Court, which is to try him for alleged crimes against humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state charged by the ICC, stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups have said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe was initiated by Senator Imee Marcos, sister of President Ferdinand Marcos but a close friend of Duterte's eldest daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two families have had a spectacular falling out since Marcos teamed with Duterte to win an election landslide in 2022. The latter has since been impeached on charges that include an alleged assassination plot against the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am calling for an urgent investigation into the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, an issue that has deeply divided the nation," Imee Marcos said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is imperative to establish whether due process was followed and to ensure that his legal rights were not just upheld but protected," she said, adding: "Our sovereignty and legal processes must remain paramount."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was arrested at Manila airport on March 11 after a brief trip to Hong Kong and flown to the Netherlands just hours later where he was turned over to the ICC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate has set a public hearing for Thursday and invited top police and other government officials to give evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imee Marcos has tracked a course largely independent from her brother on many issues, though she is running for re-election under the administration ticket for the May 12 midterm elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours after the arrest, she challenged the wisdom of the arrest of "poor president Duterte", warning that "this can only lead to trouble".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, she declared: "I cannot accept what they did to [Duterte]." (AFP)

    New transit route 'needs to seamlessly link Kai Tak'
   </title>

<img alt="The proposed mass transit system will connect the Kai Tak MTR Station with the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal with six stations in total. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796048_1_20250317132335.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Monday urged the government to give full play to undeveloped land along the planned elevated mass transit system in Kai Tak to connect the line "seamlessly" with buildings in the neighbourhood.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice-president and executive director of Our Hong Kong Foundation's public policy institute, also acknowledged it would be difficult to further reduce construction time, after the government said the system could be up and running three years earlier than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand there are procedures on tendering, and there will be construction time... I think it is hard to push even ahead of 2031," Ip told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities recently revised their plan on building the 3.5-kilometre system between Kai Tak MTR Station and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, with a target for the route to be in service by 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  Changes include adding one more stop and making it a six-station line, which Ip said provides an opportunity to improve the system's design.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are two [plots of] commercial land that are still to be sold at that new station area, and I urge the government to take reference on what Singapore has done on its [Light Rail Transit] system to seamlessly connect or integrate the new stations with the commercial buildings nearby," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another revision put forward by officials was to keep the system at least 20 metres away from residential properties, instead of the 10 metres initially proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to Kowloon City District Councillor Jimmy Lam, privacy concerns still linger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also urged authorities to look for ways to connect the Hong Kong Children's Hospital and the incoming New Acute Hospital with the proposed route.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials could take reference from the escalators and walkway system between Central and Mid-Levels.

    'Makeup primers may affect hormone levels'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says only three makeup bases that offer protection from the sun do not contain potential endocrine disruptors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796050_1_20250317133301.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday warned that some makeup bases can affect hormone levels, and people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should avoid such products.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the 37 primers it reviewed, 17 of them that claimed to offer protection against ultraviolet rays contained potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog pointed out that aside from pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding, adolescents and children should also avoid using these products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Potential endocrine disruptors] will affect your hormone levels, your sex hormones, maybe possibly it will impair your fertility," the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also for newborns, it may [cause] genital malformation; for the young adolescents, possibly premature puberty as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found that only products that protect users from the sun made by Guerlain, Hourglass, and MAC are free from potential endocrine disruptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also noted that 15 products it examined contained BHT, a type of antioxidant that helps to improve product stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the substance could potentially lead to skin and eye irritation, according to studies conducted on animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the watchdog called on the public to be aware of alcohol concentrations and fragrance allergens in cosmetics, as they could lead to dryness and irritation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Users should test products by applying them on the inner wrist, it added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Innovation and technology secretary Sun Dong said on Monday Hong Kong's I&T development was so rapid that the sector is already "in the fast lane."
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment in Beijing at a press conference on Monday about the upcoming two-day World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Wan Chai starting on April 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will mark the first time the summit is held outside mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the hosting of the summit in Hong Kong shows that the SAR is, apart from being a hub for finance, trading and aviation, also making the mark in becoming a centre for global IT cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, for the future innovation and technology industry, Hong Kong has entered the fast lane. We have clearly stated that there is a need to focus on several advantageous areas, and they're related to digital economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in Hong Kong's IT development policy blueprint, areas such as artificial intelligence, data and robots have been earmarked as focal points for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the conference's secretary general, Ren Xianliang, says the summit will discuss topics such as the development of AI models, lower costs and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the introduction of AI model DeepSeek in January as changing the world's understanding of AI, saying it has provided different professions with unprecedented development momentum and room for creativity.

    Experts weigh in on extending cryopreservation storage

<img alt="Extending the storage of embryos and gamets could raise new issues for patients according to some fertility doctors. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796041_1_20250317124547.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology said it remains uncertain whether patients will return for tailored counselling after storing their embryos or gametes for a certain period of time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is looking to make it a requirement for licensed centres under its proposal to lift the storage period restriction for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview broadcast on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  ,
  <br>
  Dr Alice Wong, a council member of the Hong Kong Society for Reproductive Medicine, pointed out that present freezing technique allows embryos and gametes to be stored longer than the current limit of a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Theoretically, with our present freezing technique we can freeze the embryos and eggs for much longer than 10 years... of course the problem is whether it is feasible for the woman to bear the pregnancy 17 years after [she freezes her eggs] so there are still other limitations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the changes possible in the future, Wong believes people will consider freezing the embryos or gametes at an earlier age to harvest eggs with higher quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said this means that patients can undergo fewer harvest and thus, save money from carrying out the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments, the government is also planing to make it mandatory for centres to provide patients information such as the risks of egg retrieval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, who's also the Vice President of the Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society of Hong Kong, pointed out that centres have already been doing so.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic women's badminton champion An Se-young came from behind to beat China's Wang Zhiyi 13-21, 21-18, 21-18 in a classic All England Open final as top seed Shi Yuqi lifted the men's crown.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Wang won the first game convincingly on Sunday and edged into a 13-10 lead during a captivating second game in Birmingham but the South Korean 2023 champion pegged her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang scented victory when the scores were tied at 18-18 in the second game but her South Korean opponent took the next three points to level the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decider was also a tight affair but again An, 23, pulled away when the players were level at 18-18, winning her fourth tournament in a row and second at the All England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had all sorts of emotions going through my mind during the second game," said An. "The thought that was concrete in my mind was not giving up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That thought motivated me to keep playing and I think that led to today's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't even try to describe how hard today's match was. The match didn't go as I'd planned, which made me extra tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm pleased with the outcome of the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, China's men's world number one Shi delivered a composed performance to see off Lee Chia-hao of Chinese Taipei 21-17, 21-19, also collecting his second All England crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, ranked 22nd, was quickly out of the blocks and opened up a three-point lead, but Shi reeled off six straight points to lead 9-6 and never relinquished his advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tenacious Lee held a 10-9 lead in the second game but he could not pull away from his 29-year-old opponent, who also won the tournament in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shi was briefly made to sweat after his 20-16 lead narrowed to 20-19 but he held his nerve to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been seven years," said Shi. "A lot has happened during these seven years, ups and downs. I've been to a few semi-finals and didn't make it in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After these seven years I'm delighted I could win it again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great that I can pass on some positive energy and values to the fans and in return they offer me support and encouragement." (AFP)
