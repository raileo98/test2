<img alt="Beijing has unveiled plans to support the markets by ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788800_1_20250123122135.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced plans on Thursday to channel hundreds of billions of yuan annually into shares from state-owned insurers, in the country's latest effort to support its domestic equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan (US$13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30 percent of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10 percent annually over the next three years, Wu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index advanced 1.47 percent shortly after open on Thursday while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.62 percent. The Hang Seng Index similarly gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the country's financial authorities signalled they would encourage medium- and long-term funds into the capital market to further stabilise stock performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, jointly released by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission, as well as five government departments, stressed attracting funds from commercial insurance, national social security and basic pension funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annuity funds, public funds, and other medium- to long-term capital funds were also expected to increase their stock market investments, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan aims to increase the proportion and stability of A-share investment in the portfolios of commercial insurance companies, and improve the investment management mechanism of the national social security fund and the basic pension insurance fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of state-owned insurance companies will be assessed over a cycle of more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the national social security and basic pension funds, the evaluation periods will be over five years and over three years, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have been intensifying policy support to prop up share prices as the world's second-largest economy navigates deflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They introduced swap and re-lending schemes totalling 800 billion yuan for stock purchases in September as well as guidelines on market capitalisation management to encourage companies to improve shareholder returns. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Flights as usual until Feb 5: Greater Bay Airlines
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of Greater Bay Airlines on Thursday said only flights after February 5 will be hit by a string of cancellations and Lunar New Year services will not be affected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liza Ng apologised on a Commercial Radio programme for the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move has been blamed on a delay in the arrival of new aircraft and planned inspections of planes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng admitted that the airline could have done better at informing those customers affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we notified all 5,500 passengers about the cancellations at the same time, by doing so, they will definitely be nervous as it will affect their trip," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When they called us, our staff might not have been able to pick up their calls immediately, making them more anxious. In this case, our customer service didn't handle the incident too well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said the airline has boosted manpower and will look at setting up more communication channels for keeping customers informed of developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, an academic who specialises in aviation transport told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it's usual practice for airlines to start selling tickets for flights involving new aircraft that have yet to be delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Achim Czerny, a professor at Polytechnic University's department of logistics and maritime studies, said buying new planes is a massive investment and the aircraft must be fully utilised as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft deliveries, the airline business is a relatively complex business, and the performance of an airline depends on many players along the supply chain, for instance, aircraft manufacturers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's certainly something that's not entirely under the control of the airline."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told RTHK it is crucial that Greater Bay Airlines reviews its flight scheduling, as well as the destinations it flies to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the airline only has a fleet of eight planes and this means there isn't much flexibility to make temporary adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the airline opened new routes, the changes in local environment, political situation, or all kinds of negative news will affect the overall passenger traffic. These are unpredictable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, it's also challenging for the airline, as well as the tourism sector, because a destination that used to be a popular tourist hotspot might have drastic changes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline said this week that it is considering ending its flights to Seoul because of an unsatisfactory performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has met with his counterparts from Qatar and Switzerland in Davos as he continued to promote Hong Kong's competitive edge on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan on Wednesday held talks with Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the Qatari finance minister, and Daniela Stoffel, state secretary for international finance of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They exchanged insights on the latest global economic and financial landscapes and discussed ways to enhance co-operation between Hong Kong and both economies in trade, financial services and infrastructure," according to a statement by the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also held bilateral meetings with government officials and business leaders from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He discussed strategies to "prevent a new, non-co-operative normal" with some 70 political and economic leaders, according to the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also told the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, that Hong Kong values taking part in the annual forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This platform offers an opportunity for Hong Kong to showcase its latest economic and social developments to global leaders, and the city's unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such participation also enables Hong Kong representatives to better understand international trends, exchange views with various economic and sectoral representatives, and present Hong Kong's perspectives."

    Safety questioned after Turkey hotel fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 Anger was growing in Turkey on Wednesday as allegations piled up that negligence played a role in the deaths of 79 people who perished when a huge fire swept through a luxury ski resort hotel in northern Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the nation observing a day of mourning, grieving families began burying their dead as questions multiplied about fire safety measures at the 12-storey Grand Kartal Hotel perched on a mountaintop in the Kartalkaya resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in the dead of night, struck at peak season for the Grand Kartal Hotel, which had 238 guests staying at the start of a two-week winter break.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a funeral in the nearby town of Bolu for eight members of the same family who died in the blaze, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan could be seen wiping away tears, his head bowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing foggy morning, with flags flying at half-mast, rescuers resumed their search of the charred and blackened structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those being buried was a neurologist, his wife and their three children, including twin boys.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out around 3:30am local time, sending huge clouds of smoke into the night air and sparking panic among the guests, many of whom tried to climb out of the windows, using bedsheets as ropes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw one kid hanging from the hotel window calling for help," said Islam, who works at a nearby hotel and did not give his surname.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was profoundly disturbed. I still cannot forget the image," he said, adding he knew some of the hotel staff who died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said nine people, including the owner, had been arrested in connection with the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism Minister Nuri Ersoy said on Tuesday the hotel had two fire escapes and had passed inspections in 2021 and 2024. (AFP)

    PSG, Real Madrid secure vital Champions League wins

<img alt="Real Madrid celebrates after a goal against Austrian side RB Salzburg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788763_2_20250123073826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain pushed Manchester City to the brink of Champions League elimination after coming from two goals down to win 4-2, while Arsenal all but secured their place in the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holders Real Madrid remain in contention for a top-eight spot after sweeping aside Red Bull Salzburg 5-1, but Bayern Munich's hopes of automatic qualification took a hit with a 3-0 defeat by Feyenoord.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's City were left stunned as they blew a two-goal lead after Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland struck early in the second half in pouring rain at the Parc des Princes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Ousmane Dembele soon halved the deficit for PSG and Bradley Barcola equalised on the hour after Desire Doue's effort came back off the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Neves' diving header put PSG on top before Gonçalo Ramos added a late fourth as the French champions climbed from 26th in the table to 22nd and bumped City out of the qualifying spots for the knockout phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how we did it, to be honest," PSG coach Luis Enrique said after the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started the second half in the worst way possible by conceding two goals," he added. "It was tricky at that point, but at the same time this team believes in itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, the European champions in 2023, are down in 25th having failed to win any of their last four games in the competition and must beat Club Brugge at home next week to salvage their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept the defeat because the best team won," said Guardiola. "It's in our hands, we have to win the last game. Hopefully we can qualify. If it doesn't happen, we don't deserve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, holders Real Madrid got back on track in Europe with a 5-1 victory over RB Salzburg to ensure they will not be eliminated at the first hurdle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes struck twice each with French superstar Kylian Mbappé also on target in a ruthless display at the Santiago Bernabeu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side lost three of their first six games in a worrying start to the competition and will likely have to compete in the extra play-off round in February which is part of the competition's new format, unless they can scrape a top-eight spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory left Los Blancos 16th, a point behind Bayer Leverkusen in eighth, which is the final spot for direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian winger Rodrygo struck twice in the first half to help Madrid take control, with Mbappé netting soon after the break and Vinicius grabbing a brace of his own to bring up a century of goals for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy after reaching 100 goals with this shirt," Vinicius told Movistar, noting he was close to Brazilian compatriot Ronaldo Nazario's tally of 104.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to be able to continue like this and score a lot of goals, and mark an era in this team – that's my dream," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeats by Liverpool, AC Milan and Lille put Madrid under pressure ahead of their final two group matches and their Austrian visitors started with vim, pinning back Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid created little of note until Rodrygo's opener after 23 minutes changed the dynamic of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, in sensational form in recent weeks with eight goals in his last nine games across all competitions, finished neatly after Jude Bellingham nudged a cross into his path at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second goal was even better, set up by Bellingham with a brilliant backheel, which Rodrygo finished first time with a crisp curling strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so easy to play with Jude, he makes everything easy, the movements he makes, his second assist was very nice and I love playing with him," said Rodrygo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Arsenal moved within touching distance of the last 16 after Declan Rice's goal in just 106 seconds inspired their 3-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have won five of their seven league phase matches, losing just once, and are almost certain to finish in the top eight, which secures automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners, who have never won the Champions League, travel to Girona for their last match in the group phase. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech shares led US stocks higher on Wednesday following strong earnings from Netflix and a White House announcement that reignited enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netflix piled on nearly 10 percent after announcing price increases in several markets, including the United States, and revealing that its subscribers have topped 300 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of AI-linked companies such as Arm, Microsoft and Nvidia also advanced following a White House announcement of some US$500 billion in new AI infrastructure by Softbank and other tech giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.3 percent to 20,009.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 percent to 44,156, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, just under an all-time record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today was back to excitement over AI," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's session also included a trove of other corporate earnings reports, most of which topped estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Procter & Gamble climbed 1.9 percent as it reported higher profits and confirmed full-year targets for increased sales. The consumer products giant has seen improvement in China but emphasized that a complete turnaround will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seagate Technology, a data storage company also active in AI, jumped 6.8 percent after reporting a 50 percent jump in quarterly revenues to US$2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Prince Harry settled on Wednesday his long-running lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's UK tabloid publisher, which agreed to pay him "substantial damages" after admitting intruding into his private life, including by hacking his phone.
 <br>
  <br>
  Murdoch's News Group Newspapers (NGN) issued a wide-ranging apology and admission of wrongdoing, in what Harry's lawyer David Sherborne called "a monumental victory" that underlined the need for further probes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The publisher apologised to him for the impact of the "serious intrusion" into the private life of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, particularly when he was younger.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement won by King Charles's youngest son concludes a years-long legal battle over claims of unlawful practices by two of Murdoch's newspapers -- The Sun and now-shuttered News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also avoids a High Court trial in the public spotlight, which had been due to begin on Tuesday and last up to eight weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "NGN offers a full and unequivocal apology... for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life," an NGN statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included the unlawful activities of private investigators working for the tabloid, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also apologised for the "phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information" by journalists and private investigators working for the News of the World.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acknowledging the damage inflicted on Harry's "relationships, friendships and family", it said it would pay him "substantial damages". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guangdong have defended their title at the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition, after beating the SAR on aggregate following a 2-1 win on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Guangzhou a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg was played at the Hong Kong Stadium in front of thousands of home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first shot on target for Hong Kong, China came shortly after the kick-off, although Mahama Awal’s attempt from the box was comfortably saved by Guangdong goalkeeper Zhao Shi.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Guangdong who struck first, when national team player Behram Abduweli scored with a narrow angle shot in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got slightly heated after the goal, as Abduweli celebrated by taking off his shirt in front of the home crowd, triggering some Hong Kong fans to throw things at him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR side later suffered another blow when they had to make an early substitution after Awal got injured. Ma Hei-wai replaced him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the hosts responded swiftly after half-time as Lau Ka-kiu made a quick run into the box and to score an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team continued their attack and created multiple scoring chances, including a one-two play between Ma and Wu Chun-ming that led to a shot by Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Dalong put Guangdong ahead again in the 85th minute with a stunning header that caught Hong Kong goalkeeper Ng Wai-him off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad made a final effort to level the game in stoppage time, but captain Stefan Pereira’s free kick was again denied by the Guangdong goalkeeper.

 Border checkpoints will not operate beyond existing hours during the Lunar New Year period, the government announced on Wednesday.

  <br>
  Last year, Lo Wu and Shenzhen Bay extending their operating hours over the festive period – something that officials decided not to do this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The government] has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances... and decided, in discussion with relevant mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the [border control points] during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries, and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also said around 8.67 million passengers trips in and out of the city are expected to take place over the eight-day Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday, with the majority of travellers passing through land border points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said banks have made preparations to deal with any risks posed by potential US trade tariffs and are closely monitoring developments.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing about the banking sector's performance in 2024, HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen noted that there's a lack of clarity in terms of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, you can expect that if the US imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then the global trade system will suffer and that would actually also impact on business outlook, " Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually asked our banks to stay on high alert on what's the impact of those, and to make sure the risk-management practices are fully in place for handling whatever is coming their way."

    More resources for banks to combat scams: HKMA

<img alt="Arthur Yuen, HKMA‘s deputy chief executive (center), says there's been a significant jump in the number of fraud cases locally. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788711_1_20250122190533.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said that it is allocating more resources to tackle financial and banking related frauds, following a surge in deception cases last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arthur Yuen, the authority’s deputy chief executive, said during a press conference that over 40,000 fraud cases were reported to the police in the first 11 months of last year – an increase of 8.7 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses incurred totaled HK$8.5 billion, meaning some HK$25 million were lost each day -- an amount Yuen said was "really concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen very important, serious cases of people losing their life savings simply because they have clicked on links or they have answered calls without caution," he said, adding that a new promotional campaign was launched to discourage people from clicking onto fraudulent hyperlinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspicious account alert system was also expanded last month for automatic teller machines to issue fraud alert over high-risk transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures, meanwhile, include a "Money Safe" tool that the authority hopes to make available in the first or second quarter of this year, to allow customers to lock all or part of their bank account balances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yuen said the city's banking sector posted the slowest profit growth in three years, with the aggregated pre-tax profit among 30 retail banks increasing by only 8.3 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the 62 percent annual growth registered in 2023.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials in Thailand on Wednesday stressed that the country remains "a safe destination for all international visitors", following reports of Hong Kong residents being lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong also expressed its deep regret, saying it understands what happened had raised concern about the safety among SAR travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to assure that Thailand remains a safe destination for all international visitors since none of the victims are tourists. They were misled by scammers to travel to Thailand to work in high-paying jobs but ended up being escorted across the border to the scam centres," a consulate spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hongkongers are believed to still be held captive in the region and forced to work in so-called scam farms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai authorities have taken steps to tackle transnational crimes and human trafficking that "will help reassure international tourists and visitors of their safety", the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include addressing misinformation online, ensuring sufficient police deployment in high-risk areas, and introducing a two-level boundary control system along the eastern and western borders across 14 provinces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Thai officials had also met their Chinese and Myanmar counterparts in Kunming and "reached positive consensus on eradicating the scam centres in Myanmar", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Thai government posted an AI-generated video of its prime minister speaking in Mandarin, encouraging Chinese tourists to visit the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the clip posted to the government's Facebook page, a likeness of Paetongtarn Shinawatra appeared to speak in fluent Mandarin, a language that the prime minister does not speak in real life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The character emphasised at the start of the video that it had been made with AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that recent reports of Chinese nationals being lured to scam compounds around Thailand's borders have triggered concerns among Chinese tourists... Thailand's government puts the safety of all tourists as its utmost priority," the AI Paetongtarn said.

    Govt urged to speed up ban on flavoured tobacco

<img alt="COSH and HKU researchers found that nearly half of surveyed smokers use flavoured cigarettes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788690_1_20250122172324.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH) on Wednesday called on the government to speed up a ban on flavoured tobacco products, saying they make it harder for smokers to quit.
 <br>
  <br>
  From January to May last year, COSH and the University of Hong Kong polled 5,600 people, of whom 2,600 were smokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers found that nearly half of smokers used flavoured cigarettes, with around 40 percent of teenagers in the poll moderately to severely addicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tong, the council’s chairman, said flavoured cigarettes give a false impression to young people that they are less harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The flavours, which might include mint, strawberry, or even alcohol-tasting flavours, are attractive to young people. They cover up the unpleasant smell and unpleasant feeling caused by traditional cigarettes,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last June, health officials announced plans to ban e-cigarettes, flavoured tobacco and lighting up while in a queue. But there is no timeline for the legislation yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong urged the government to table the amendments to the Legislative Council as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed off the possible impact on the tourism sector and bar industry if the ban takes effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually the economic impact of tobacco control has been exaggerated. We believe that better tobacco control in Hong Kong would attract more businesses and help the economy,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that bars and restaurants saw revenues increase by 30 percent within two years after the indoor smoking ban was introduced in 2007.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung on Wednesday said fire service installation and equipment inspections at new buildings will be dealt with quicker once a new office opens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, he said the One-stop Coordination Office for New Fire Protection Facilities Acceptance is expected to cut the certification process down, from an average 52 days to 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the Fire Services Department will review licensing procedures in light of potential budget cuts to help address the government's deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary is now preparing the budget. As usual, we will use our resources prudently and review the resources allocations, review the workflow, review all the licensing, in particular, the licensing procedure in order to cope with the government's budget cuts," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire chief also said his department has beefed up inspections of old buildings after a fire in a residential building in Jordan killed five people last April.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conducted inspections of 1,000 old buildings last year with a relatively higher fire risk after the tragic fire at the New Lucky House. More than 8,661 fire hazard abatement notices were issued during the inspection and over half of these cases were related to smoke stop door irregularities," he said.

 The government says it will look at how big the fines should be for companies that breach data protection laws to make sure they are acceptable to firms, while still having a deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans are in place to empower the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to fine those involved in data leaks, but some firms have expressed worries about being hit with stiff punishments for lapses, pointing to the sluggish economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a Legislative Council session on Wednesday, constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang said the government understands the concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is studying on how to appropriately adjust the legislative amendment proposals, e.g. whether to effect the legislative amendments by phases, thereby reducing the possible effect on business sectors; and how to suitably determine the amount of administrative fines, ensuring they are set at an acceptable level while not losing deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang told lawmakers there were 217 data breaches last year, a rise of nearly 30 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Election Committee lawmaker Carmen Kan asked whether the government could introduce a "shared responsibility" system when it comes to scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kan said under such a system, various parties such as financial institutions, telecommunication and media firms would have to fork out compensation for scam victims if the companies were deemed to have failed in their responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, financial services undersecretary Joseph Chan said a similar concept of shared responsibility over unauthorised transactions is already covered in existing laws.

    Consumer body 'deeply concerned' over axed flights

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's consumer watchdog has expressed deep concern over Greater Bay Airlines' decision to cancel flights in the coming weeks, after receiving complaints regarding the low-cost carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline previously announced the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March, affecting around 5,500 passengers to places like Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received two complaints regarding flight delays or changes involving HK$7,964 as of Wednesday noon, and has since contacted the budget carrier to follow up on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council calls on airlines to prepare for emergencies in peak seasons, fulfil their service commitments, so as not to hurt the reputation of the air carrier and Hong Kong as an international aviation hub," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiyan Song, associate dean of the Polytechnic University's tourism management school, said passengers might think twice in future before booking with the budget carrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's understandable from the passengers' perspective. They would be unhappy with this cancellation, because this disrupted their travel plans. In the future, when the passengers travel to the same destinations, they would think twice whether they would book [with] Greater Bay Airlines," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if, in the future, the [airline] recovers from this crisis and provides good services, customers will gradually build their confidence in the airline."

 China on Wednesday vowed to defend its national interests after US President Donald Trump said that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, adding China was "firmly committed to safeguarding national interests". (AFP)

 Transport minister Mable Chan said officials met the senior management of Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday morning over its cancellation of 128 flights between February and March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said authorities want a detailed report from the firm in around a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day before, the airline cited a delay in new aircraft deliveries and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft as the reason for the cancellations, which will affect 5,500 passengers to places like Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The budget airline added on Wednesday that negligence in its flight scheduling process was found following an internal review, but flights over the Lunar New Year period would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after attending a Legislative Council meeting, Chan said the government wants a detailed report on matters such as remedial measures in around a week's time, noting the airline had already submitted some initial figures to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Civil Aviation Department have already met with senior management of Greater Bay Airlines, to learn more about the way forward," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our message is very clear. We told the company that it must protect the rights of affected travellers, and that it must do its best to minimise the effects on passengers through various means."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said aviation authorities meet with airlines regularly, and they require firms to submit regular financial and operational reports to ensure that they are run in a robust manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the existing regulatory regime as comprehensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Greater Bay Airlines should learn from this experience, noting that it's a growing firm that her bureau wants to help in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan expressed hope the airline could be more flexible in scheduling flights in future, by adding buffers in areas such as manpower and computer systems.

    Tackle PRH abuse through applicant, tenant land search
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan has recommended the Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Housing Society (HKHS) conduct thorough land searches for public rental housing (PRH) applicants before determining their eligibility for allocation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation was part of a comprehensive set of 31 improvements proposed by the office following its investigation into the government's efforts to combat the abuse of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said alongside screening existing tenants, preventing abuse at the source through rigorous vetting can significantly minimise misuse, adding that a new mechanism can make the process more cost-efficient and task effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, it cost almost HK$640 for each verification. With the intervention of my office through this investigation, the Housing Authority and the Housing Society have devised a new mechanism by which both organisations will submit these tenants' information or declaration by batches to the Land Registry and use a computerised system to verify the information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has significantly reduced the cost for such verification process from HK$640 per case down to HK$4 per case."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include developing specific incentive schemes for the staff of property service agents and security contractors to encourage their participation in combating abuse and enhancing communication with mainland and Macau authorities to obtain information about tenants' property ownership in those regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog commended the authorities for successfully reclaiming over 7,000 flats over abuse or violations of tenancy agreements, but Chan pointed out that the highest prosecution rate in the past seven years was only 4.2 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some tenants were evicted from their units but did not face prosecution for PRH abuse, while the two-year prosecution limit passed for other cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he hopes that authorities will consider extending the prosecution time limit and imposing heavier penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Department (HD) thanked the watchdog for its investigation report, and said they would review and study the recommendations to enhance existing measures and explore new methods to combat abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just launched the Report Public Housing Abuse Award on January 15, hoping to gather more accurate intelligence on tenancy abuse for taking action. To strengthen the deterrent effect and gradually reduce the abuse of public housing resources, we are also actively exploring amendments to the Housing Ordinance to criminalise the act of serious tenancy abuse, targeting to have the Bills passed in the Legislative Council in mid-2025," a spokesman for the HD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that capable tenants will surrender their PRH flats so that precious public housing resources can be allocated to those in genuine need, optimising the use of public housing resources."

    Friday to see largest Kai Tak Sports Park stress test

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Motorists are being advised to give Kai Tak a swerve on Friday evening as tens of thousands of people head there for the biggest test event yet at the nearly completed sports park in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 63,000 people are expected to pack the main stadium, the arena and the youth sports ground to capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd, most of them civil servants, will be treated to a concert by bands from various disciplined services.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Wednesday, deputy police commissioner Chow Yat-ming said the test will be conducted in three stages between 6pm and 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first stage is when participants enter the venues from about 6pm, and the second stage is a test of a simulated emergency evacuation, while the third will be when participants naturally exit the venues," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The test will involve civil servants, government employees, as well as members from different social communities, and we'll test our arrangements on the natural entry and exit of participants, and that for buses and taxis, to make sure that the event will be conducted in a safe manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said that being as 10 drills have been held at the park since last October, the main purpose this time will be evaluating facilities surrounding the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant transport commissioner Chow Bing-kay urged people taking part in the drill not to drive to the venue, saying roads in the area will already be busy with rush hour traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other motorists would also do well to avoid Kai Tak if possible, Chow said, adding that extra MTR services will be running, especially between Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian rescuers retrieved two more bodies after they resumed their search on Wednesday for people missing after floods and landslides on Indonesia’s main island of Java, bringing the death toll to 19.
 <br>
  <br>
  Waters from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in Petungkriyono resort area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted on Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and, whenever possible, survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scores of rescue personnel were searching through a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a café to search for at least nine people reported missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed personnel digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains. (AP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has called on countries to promote collaboration among public, private and philanthropic sectors so as to encourage private investments in green and transition projects.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, he joined a breakfast meeting organised by the Giving to Amplify Earth Action launched by the WEF.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that there was a significant funding gap globally in responding to climate change and highlighted Hong Kong's role as a leading green finance hub in Asia, gathering financial institutions, professional services and talent with relevant expertise.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that asks government agency chiefs to combat Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) policies in federal agencies, contracting and the private sector, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order also encouraged the private sector to "end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences," the White House added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The action outlined in an Office of Personnel Management memorandum came one day after Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity programmes, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBT people and other traditionally under-represented groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programmes will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the memorandum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By Thursday, federal agencies are directed to compile a list of federal DEI offices and workers as of Election Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  By next Friday, they are expected to develop a plan to execute a “reduction-in-force action” against those federal workers. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States, Australia, India and Japan recommitted to working together on Tuesday, after the first meeting of the Quad grouping's top diplomats since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement after the talks in Washington, hosted by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on his first day in the job, the four nations said officials would meet regularly to prepare for an upcoming leaders' summit in India, expected this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio earlier said he said would stress the importance of working with allies "on the things that are important to America and Americans" during the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He posed with Australia's Penny Wong, India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japan's Takeshi Iwaya in front of the flags of their countries before the meeting at the State Department, but did not respond to questions from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant that the Quad (foreign ministers' meeting) took place within hours of the inauguration of the Trump Administration," Jaishankar said on X after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This underlines the priority it has in the foreign policy of its member states."
  <br>
  <br>
  The four nations restated their "shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific where the rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty, and territorial integrity are upheld and defended," the joint statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also strongly oppose any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio also met separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Wong told a news conference in Washington she had a "very positive discussion" with Rubio on Aukus, a trilateral security partnership that also involves the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and a political tool for the US to contain China and maintain its hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has also said the Aukus alliance would intensify a regional arms race and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Travel Industry Council, Fanny Yeung, on Wednesday said Greater Bay Airlines' move to cancel scores of flights in the coming weeks won't have a significant impact, given the city's overall capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers are believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the move, which mostly affects its services to Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of affected passengers is around 5,000 plus, so it's still a very minor share when we compare with the overall flight capacity. So I don't think that will have a significant impact," Yeung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, the company should take steps to avoid a repeat of such issues, Yeung added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the low-cost carrier apologised for the cancellations and said it has already contacted customers regarding rebookings and refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An internal review in this matter has been carried out immediately and negligence was found in our flight scheduling process. We have also taken immediate action to tighten up the relevant approval procedure for flight scheduling," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said no flights over the Lunar New Year are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier added that it is considering dropping its flights to Seoul because of unsatisfactory performance.

    Guidelines to help govt staff uphold national security

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said a set of guidelines will be introduced in the first quarter of this year, allowing public officers to better understand their responsibilities on safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year's Policy Address stated that all government bureaux and departments must review guidelines to ensure compliance with provisions in the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Tang said the guidelines would provide clear explanations on 20 categories of national security and how they relate to officers' work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public officers not only have to make considerations of national security at work, but they also have to be proactive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them don't fully understand that, so we will introduce a set of guidelines in the first quarter of 2025, using plain language and examples, instead of legal terms, to make explanations."
  <br>
  <br>
  An example cited by Tang is how government procurement may be affected by foreign sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a cross-border emergency-response mechanism established last year strengthening collaboration between Hong Kong and other Greater Bay Area cities, the security minister said up to two large-scale drills are held every year, while small-scale ones take place more frequently.

    Panama complains to UN over Trump canal threat

<img alt="Panamanian authorities have launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two Panama Canal ports, aimed at ensuring the efficient and transparent use of public resources. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788620_1_20250122100432.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama has complained to the United Nations over US President Donald Trump's "worrying" threat to seize the Panama Canal, even as it launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two ports on the inter-oceanic waterway.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the government in Panama City referred to an article of the UN Charter precluding any member from "the threat or use of force" against the territorial integrity or political independence of another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missive distributed to reporters on Tuesday urges Guterres to refer the matter to the UN Security Council, without asking for a meeting to be convened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities then announced an "exhaustive audit" would be launched to ensure the "efficient and transparent use of public resources" at the Panama Ports Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, part of Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comptroller's office said the aim was to determine whether the company was complying with its concession agreements, including adequate reporting of income, payments and contributions to the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said operated on the principle of neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," Mulino said in response to Trump's threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Mao Ning said China has not participated in the management and operation of the Panama Canal, and has never intervened in the canal's affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Beijing respects Panama's sovereignty over the canal and recognises it as a permanently neutral international waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Ports Company's concession agreement was extended by 25 years in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the canal's main user, followed by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2000, the waterway has contributed more than US$30 billion to Panama's state coffers, including nearly US$2.5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ichiro Suzuki, whose uncanny hitting talent made him a Seattle Mariners icon after he'd established himself as a star in Japan, has become the first Japanese player elected to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro headlines the 2025 Hall of Fame class to be enshrined at Cooperstown, New York, which also includes pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player, as opposed to a pitcher, to play in the US major leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won both American League Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year honors that year, going on to earn 10 All-Star nods, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished his career with 3,089 hits in MLB – on top of 1,278 he piled up in nine years in Japan. His 4,367 hits as a professional are the most of any player in baseball history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He amassed two batting titles, 1,420 runs and 509 stolen bases in more than 19 Major League seasons while expanding the horizons for Japanese players aiming to make the move Stateside when some still doubted that their skills would translate to MLB.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004 Ichiro won his second batting title and broke George Sisler's 84-year-old record with 262 hits – part of a stretch of 10 straight seasons with at least 200 hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first year of eligibility, the 51-year-old Ichiro fell one ballot shy of unanimous election – something achieved to date only by Yankees pitching great Mariano Rivera. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump voiced his latest tariff threats in remarks to reporters at the White House a day after taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs," Trump said of the EU. "You can't get fairness unless you do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would "straighten that out" by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10 percent tariff, saying it was "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: "Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc was ready to defend its interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remained an important partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's "first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate" with Trump, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs, mainland media accused him of blaming China for Washington's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US, while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has spoken out against protectionism, saying no one wins in a trade war. (AFP)

    Trump 'open' to Elon Musk buying TikTok

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would be open to tech billionaire Elon Musk - the owner of social media platform X - buying Chinese-owned app TikTok.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump told reporters when asked if he was open to Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, acquiring the video-sharing platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before he took office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive order directed his attorney general to delay the implementation of the law for 75 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  To save the company's US operations, Trump on Monday also floated the idea of a 50-50 partnership between "the United States" and its Chinese owner ByteDance, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Tuesday if his phone had TikTok, which is banned on US government devices, Trump said: "No, but... I think I'll get it right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the tacit co-operation of Oracle, its server provider, TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday crediting Trump's commitment to save the app for making the reversal possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if existing users can still enjoy TikTok, Apple and Google have still not made the app available in their app stores, therefore denying downloads to new users as well as updates to those who have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user if the app is accessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a report that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok. (AFP)

    Trump highlights billion-dollar AI partnership

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Japanese tech behemoth SoftBank Group soared more than eight per cent on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a major investment to build AI infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called "Stargate", set to launch in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool beat Lille 2-1 to maintain their perfect record in this season's Champions League and clinch qualification for the last 16, while Barcelona produced a stunning comeback to beat Benfica 5-4 in a classic to secure their own place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Anfield side are the only team with a maximum 21 points from seven matches in this new, expanded Champions League and they now know they will skip next month's play-offs and head straight to the last 16 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah ran clear to give Liverpool the lead at home to a Lille team who have also impressed this season, and the visitors appeared in trouble when they had Aissa Mandi sent off just before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan David swept in an equaliser for Lille, but Harvey Elliott's shot took a wicked deflection on its way in to give Liverpool the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy that we are top eight. That's the only thing that tells me something, because this league table doesn't tell you anything," said Slot when asked about being through to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the biggest drama on the night, however, came in the rain in Lisbon, where Barcelona trailed 4-2 with 12 minutes of the 90 remaining, but somehow recovered to win 5-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greek striker Vangelis Pavlidis scored a hat-trick in the first half-hour for Benfica, including a penalty, while Robert Lewandowski netted from the spot for Barca, who were 3-1 down at the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha pulled it back to 3-2 when a clearance by the goalkeeper ricocheted back off the Brazilian's head and in, but a Ronald Araujo own goal midway through the second half appeared to have secured the win for the Portuguese side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another Lewandowski penalty on 78 minutes gave Barcelona renewed hope, and Eric Garcia headed in the equaliser on 86 minutes, before Raphinha ran away to settle an incredible game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mentality of the team, they always believe in themselves and this was unbelievable to see," said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans are second with six wins out of seven, and will finish in the top eight to go straight to the last 16. Benfica, with 10 points, must still sweat to reach the play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Atlético Madrid are third on 15 points and certain to at least be in the play-offs after a Julián Alvarez brace secured a 2-1 home victory over Bayer Leverkusen in a game both teams finished with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico had Pablo Barrios sent off midway through the first half, and Piero Hincapie then put Leverkusen ahead just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina star Alvarez levelled seven minutes into the second half, and Hincapie was sent off for the Germans before another Alvarez goal won it for the home side in the last minute as they climbed above Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's Europa League winners Atalanta are also guaranteed at least a play-off place after crushing Sturm Graz of Austria 5-0. (AFP)

    US stocks gain as market greets initial Trump moves

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks jumped on Tuesday as markets greeted early moves by US President Donald Trump that raised hopes new tariffs won't be as bad as feared.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's first day back in the White House included a litany of executive actions, but while he threatened new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the trade announcements were "more benign than expected," said a note from Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other analysts pointed out that Trump did not announce immediate tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 percent at 44,025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 6,049, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent to 19,756.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's gains came as US Treasury yields edged lower, a sign investors remain less perturbed by inflation worries following last week's consumer price data.
  <br>
  <br>
  While several large technology companies moved higher, an exception was Apple, which slumped 3.2 percent following a report of weak China sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive fell 6.5 percent following a Trump executive order that takes aim at programs favoring EVs. EV charging companies ChargePoint Holdings and EVgo also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dow member 3M gained 4.2 percent as it reported better than expected profits. William Brown, CEO of the industrial products company, pointed to strong sales momentum, saying "we are confident in our ability to deliver our 2025 guidance." (AFP)

    Djokovic beats Alcaraz in Aussie Open blockbuster

<img alt="Djokovic celebrates after his victory against Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788581_1_20250122053312.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A vintage Novak Djokovic tamed Carlos Alcaraz in a late-night blockbuster to set up an Australian Open semi-final with Alexander Zverev as two-time women's defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fought on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic rolled back the years at the scene of his greatest achievements on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph sealed close to 1:00 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb surged into the semi-finals and a date with world number two Zverev to edge closer to an 11th Melbourne crown and all-time record 25th Slam title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just wish that this match today was the final," said Djokovic, who had to have his thigh heavily strapped and appeared to be labouring at the end of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just one of the most epic matches I have played on this court, any court really," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With former rival Andy Murray now in his coaching corner, Djokovic was at his imperious and defiant best, cupping his ear to the crowd after winning big points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic was at the centre of a row on Monday after he demanded an apology – and got one – from a local TV presenter for what he called "insulting and offensive comments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's world number three Alcaraz will have to wait another year to get a kangaroo tattoo. He had vowed to get one if he won the Australian Open for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old four-time major champion has still never been beyond the Melbourne Park last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  He felt he should have rammed home the advantage when Djokovic was struggling with his movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to say that was the biggest mistake that I made today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former number one Djokovic extended his career advantage over Alcaraz to 5-3, having also beaten him in the Paris Olympics final in their last meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz got the better of his rival in the 2023 and 2024 Wimbledon finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot and windy conditions, Germany's Zverev defeated the American Tommy Paul 7-6 (7/1), 7-6 (7/0), 2-6, 6-1 to step up his quest to win a Grand Slam for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old lost his cool at one point because of a feather. The umpire called for a replay when the feather drifted in front of him as he played a shot at a critical juncture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "C'mon, that is unbelievable on break point," he shouted, before taking out his fury on Paul by breaking to love.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner plays home hope Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, the winner facing American 21st seed Ben Shelton or the unseeded Italian Lorenzo Sonego.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Sabalenka will face Paula Badosa in the last four as the Belarusian bids to win the Australian Open for a third time in a row, something last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one kept that dream alive but had to battle for it in beating Russian 27th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly I was just praying, trying to put the ball back in these tough conditions," said Sabalenka. "I'm just super happy I was able to somehow magically win this match." (AFP)

    Israel military chief resigns over October 7

<img alt="Herzi Halevi had been widely expected to step down. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788576_1_20250122051633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army chief Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday he would resign on March 6, taking responsibility for the security lapse on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian Hamas fighters from Gaza carried out a cross-border attack on Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Halevi, who had been widely expected to step down in the wake of the deadliest single day in Israel's history, said he would complete the Israel Defence Forces' inquiries into October 7 and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear who would replace Halevi, who said he would transfer the IDF command to a yet-to-be-named successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite public anger over the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has resisted calls to open a state inquiry into its own responsibility for the security breach that resulted in 1,200 Israelis being killed and about 250 hostages taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address, Halevi promised a deep and transparent investigation, the details of which would be presented to the defence minister and, as much as permissible, to the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of senior military officers have already resigned over October 7, and the head of the military's Southern Command, Major-General Yaron Finkelman, also said he would be resigning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe our prime minister should take example from the personal responsibility that the chief of staff has taken," activist Gil Ashkenazy, 60, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 46,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's war in Gaza, and the heavily built-up territory has been widely demolished by Israeli bombardments and airstrikes. (Reuters)

 The death toll from a fire that engulfed a hotel at a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday rose to 76, officials said, expressing great "pain" at the tragedy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said desperate guests had tried to escape using ropes, footage showed bedsheets hanging from the windows, and media reports suggest some had died after trying to jump to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pain is great," Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the resort in Kartalkaya, around 170 kilometres northwest of the capital Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze broke out at 3:27 am (0027 GMT) in the 12-storey Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 238 guests were registered at the hotel, the minister added. It was a peak time during a two-week school holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish authorities detained four suspects including the owner of the resort hotel, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister previously announced that six prosecutors had been allocated to investigate the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private broadcaster NTV said that the dead included three people who had jumped from the hotel's windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire is believed to have started in the restaurant and spread quickly, though it was not immediately clear what caused it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the structure backs onto a cliff, making it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China and Russia should consolidate and expand bilateral relations and push for in-depth development of practical cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks when holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi stressed that in the new year, he is willing to work with Putin to continue guiding China-Russia relations towards greater heights, to cope with the uncertainties of the external environment with the stability and resilience of China-Russia relations, to jointly promote the development and revitalisation of the two countries, and to uphold international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the two sides to continue deepening strategic coordination, firming up mutual support and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said Beijing and Moscow should jointly defend the UN-centred international system and the outcomes of World War Two victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said the two countries should also uphold basic norms governing international relations and practise true multilateralism. (Xinhua)

    A trade war leaves no winners: Vice Premier Ding

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned on Tuesday that no country would emerge victorious from a trade war, in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos as Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, told the forum that a "tug of war" was underway between supporters and opponents of economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the board with imminent tariff wars and trade wars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global governance system is undergoing profound adjustments. Human society has once again come to a critical crossroads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism leads nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war," Ding said, without mentioning Trump or the US by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has also been locked in trade disputes with the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU imposed hefty tariffs on electric cars made in China last year. In turn, Beijing targeted European brandies and opened probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without mentioning the EU or any country by name, Ding warned against "erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a "consistent approach" in addressing climate change and trade policies "so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition".
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe was ready to improve ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Europe "must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest" despite escalating trade tensions between the two. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host the World Snooker Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Arena, the first ranking tournament to be held in the city since 1989.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will take place from March 4 to 9, featuring the top 32 players from around the world including Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who will be playing on home turf for the first time after becoming Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other snooker greats set to be in action include China's top player Ding Junhui, former World champions Mark Selby of England and Australian Neil Robertson, and the current World champion Kyren Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be the first formal sport event to be held in Kai Tak Arena, so there will be a lot of challenges because I don't think anyone in Hong Kong has the experience of organising something of this scale in this venue," said Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working on every single detail meticulously, especially the production, the seating plan, the scenery, the facilities for example the media room, the media centre, the other rooms for the players, a lot of things. It's not an easy task, but we are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also the first time Hong Kong will host the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Brownell, CEO of the World Snooker Tour, said it'll be a treat for both the fans and the players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be desperate to become the first to lift the historic World Grand Prix trophy in Hong Kong, and to win the historic highs prize money for this event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the local fans, it will be incredible opportunity to watch the best players on the planet and marvel at their skills. We are sure the atmosphere will be electric and it will be a fabulous experience for everyone inside the arena."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the event, exhibition matches will be held for other elite players, including local favourite Marco Fu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it promises to be a great tournament that would further promote snooker in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking back, many years ago I went to Queen Elizabeth Stadium to watch the likes of Steve Davis, Jimmy White, they played in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and that's when I really fell in love with the game of snooker," Fu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure many youngsters will come to this tournament to watch all the top players playing, and I'm sure they're going to fall in love with the game of snooker.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this tournament, more youngsters will pick up the cue and start to play snooker. It's going to be fantastic."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Tuesday announced the cancellation of flights, which could disrupt the plans of some Lunar New Year travellers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline did not specify the number of flights affected, but it's understood that more than 200 flights scheduled between January and March, mainly to Japan and South Korea, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greater Bay Airlines cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and statutory safety inspections of existing aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it's helping passengers to re-book tickets or with refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will learn from the experience and review the relevant arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also said all fees will be waived to reduce the possible impact on people's travel plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight cancellations sparked a backlash on social media, with would-be holidaymakers complaining that their travel plans have been disrupted in a Facebook group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport secretary Mable Chan expressed deep concern and requested a detailed report.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said the Transport and Logistics Bureau will meet with airline representatives to understand the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, said 11 tour groups heading to Tokushima, Japan, after February 10 will be affected, involving more than 100 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, we give customers options. They can choose to switch to other destinations. If they cannot find a suitable alternative due to flight disruption, we usually provide a full refund," Huen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen Chun-ning, executive director of WWPKG Holdings, said five tour groups going to Sendai in March will have to be cancelled, with around 100 people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travellers can reschedule or choose to cancel for a full refund, Yuen said.

<img alt="The Immigration Department says those convicted were caught providing illegal shopping and tour guide services. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788514_1_20250121190942.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Tuesday said seven mainland visitors were jailed for up to two months each for working illegally in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The jail sentences came after officers arrested eight people this month who provided illegal tour guide services and acted as "shopping agents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven earlier appeared at Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts and at Tuen Mun Magistrates’ Courts, and admitted they had breached their condition of stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were given 54 days to two months in jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said one case is still under investigation, and there could be more arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said four women acted as tour guides in Hong Kong. They arranged guided visits for their guests to different tourist attractions in the city, and took photos for them, at an hourly rate of HK$100 to HK$300.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the other four men, officers said they acted as “shopping agents” by buying food and necessities at supermarkets and restaurants on the mainland, and delivered the goods to customers in Hong Kong. They could earn anywhere between HK$100 and HK$200 for each transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four men and four women, aged between 19 and 52, were arrested in Hong Kong between January 13 and Monday, after officers posed as customers and reserved services from them through social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Department deputy commander Leung Tsz-chung reminded citizens to be wary of such services.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When choosing those services, people have to be careful and vigilant, and to make sure the service providers can be employed legally in Hong Kong. Otherwise, people may face criminal liability,” Leung said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lunar New Year fireworks display on the second day of the Year of the Snake will feature patterns of pandas, smiley faces and gold ingots, organisers said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-minute show, divided into nine scenes, will light up Victoria Harbour from 8pm on January 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said 23,888 pyrotechnic shells will be launched from three barges, opening with a lucky number eight and a scene entitled "A Brand New Beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Mao, CEO of Pyromagic Multimedia Productions, said the eighth scene is the highlight of the show, featuring patterns of six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The six panda heads symbolise the family of pandas that are now in Hong Kong. Two of which are newborns, a very happy moment for Hong Kong, and also China has given Hong Kong two pandas. Along with the two natives that are always in Hong Kong, we have a family of six," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao described the extravaganza here as "one of a kind".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very beautiful backdrop, and to feature a fireworks display in this beautiful backdrop is one of a kind. There's nowhere in the world that can beat this beautiful backdrop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fireworks in Guangzhou, they don't have a backdrop like in Hong Kong... Hong Kong is certainly world famous, the fireworks event held here is always number one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators can listen to RTHK Radio 4 for synchronised music during the show.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in December compared to the same month the year before, official figures showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the same rate as seen in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said underlying inflation, which nets out the effects of the government's one-off relief measures, rose 1.3 percent year-on-year, slightly higher than the 1.2 percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices for alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increase last month, rising 21.2 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was followed by the prices for electricity, gas, and water, which rose 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clothing and footwear prices fell, however, by 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said underlying consumer price inflation remained modest last month, with prices of major components broadly in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain moderate in the near term. As the Hong Kong economy continues to grow, domestic cost may see some upward pressures. External price pressures should remain contained, though uncertainties from the external environment warrant attention," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 2024 as a whole, overall consumer prices were 1.7 percent higher than in the previous year, while the underlying inflation rate stood at 1.1 percent.

 China installed a record amount of renewable energy in 2024, data from the National Energy Administration (NEA) showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has committed to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation added about 277 gigawatts (GW) of solar last year, an increase from the 217 GW added from the previous year, the NEA said in a statement. It also expanded its wind power by nearly 80 GW.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total installed capacity of solar and wind power were around 887 GW and 521 GW respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping in 2020 set a target for at least 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity installed by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  China surpassed this target last year, almost six years earlier than planned, data from the NEA in August showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  And it has built almost twice as much wind and solar capacity as every other country combined, according to research published in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing invested over US$50 billion in new solar supply capacity from 2011 to 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar industry has also benefited from access to cheap raw materials, readily available capital from state-owned banks, and huge engineering manpower. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland student from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is suspected to have lost around HK$1.8 million in a phone scam, sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the woman, 22, got a phone call last August from someone pretending to be from the SAR's Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammer told her she was involved in a case on the mainland and threatened to arrest her unless she opened an account at a designated bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victim was asked to make six money transfers to the bank account to prove that she was innocent, sources have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Failing to contact the fraudster, she realised she had been scammed and reported the case to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an email to students on Sunday, HKU said that more than 60 students have been scammed in recent months, resulting in a total loss of HK$60 million.

    China urges US cooperation to resolve trade issues

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it hopes for cooperation with the United States to resolve trade issues, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the United States, properly manage differences and expand mutually beneficial cooperation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States will work with China to jointly promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday warned that he could impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico next month, but appeared to delay any action against China for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his inauguration speech, Trump did not target China nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, he directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo also said China will firmly maintain its national interests, but at the same time it is necessary for senior officials of both countries to maintain contact in an appropriate manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to a question on whether Beijing would drop its sanctions on the newly confirmed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was among a group of American officials sanctioned by China in 2020 over Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On TikTok, Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app, but said he might impose tariffs on China if Beijing does not approve a potential US deal with TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order kept TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform’s users.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump said he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between its Chinese owner ByteDance and the US government, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s CEO, attended Trump’s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised he would pause the ban, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump said he could travel to China as soon as this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if he would travel to China this year, the US leader said, "Yeah, could be. I've had the invite." (Agencies)

    At least 10 people killed in Turkish ski resort fire

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 10 people were killed and another 32 injured after a fire broke out at a hotel at a ski resort in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out overnight at the hotel's restaurant in the resort of Kartalkaya in Bolu province, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims died after jumping out of the building in a panic, Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told the state-run Anadolu Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private NTV television said some people tried to climb down from their rooms using sheets.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 234 guests staying at the hotel, Aydin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Necmi Kepcetutan, a ski instructor at the hotel, said he was asleep when the fire erupted and he rushed out of the building. He told NTV television that he then helped some 20 guests out of the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the hotel was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for guests to locate the fire escape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed the roof and top floors of the hotel on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the fire was not immediately known. NTV television suggested that the wooden cladding on the hotel's exterior may have accelerated the spread of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kartalkaya is a popular ski resort in the Koroglu mountains, some 300 kilometres east of Istanbul. The fire occurred during the school semester break when hotels in the region are packed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aydin's office said 30 fire trucks and 28 ambulances were sent to the site. (AP)

    New website to help firms comply with competition law

<img alt="The Competition Commission has launched a new platform for SMEs to access information related to the Competition Ordinance more easily. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788498_1_20250121154256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Less than a quarter of small to medium-sized companies in Hong Kong have taken adequate steps to make sure they don't fall foul of competition laws, a watchdog warned on Tuesday, adding that it has come up with a new website to help firms get the information they need.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Competition Commission said a survey of around 600 companies it carried out from late 2023 to 2024 found only 24 percent of SMEs had policies in place to ensure they complied with competition regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey results suggest that the SMEs have a quite good understanding of the Competition Ordinance. At the same time, we realise they have some confusion on some details regarding the law. We found out that they may not have the necessary resources to implement compliance plans within the company," said Gary Shiu, an executive director of the commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said larger enterprises have the resources to hire professionals to provide advice on the matter, while smaller companies that don't have the money are at a greater risk of breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new platform, SME Hub, highlights key aspects of the ordinance and has an assessment tool for identifying potential risks with business activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said it also includes real-life scenarios or hypothetical examples to bust common myths surrounding the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All enterprises have some misunderstanding concerning being part of a cartel agreement or price-fixing agreements. They would always think that as long as there are no anti-competitive effects or any negative effects in the market, then why would they infringe the law?" Shiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said it will also be organising talks and training for SMEs on implementing internal guidelines for the ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Kwok, who chairs the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said limited resources is not the only challenge when it comes to implementing relevant guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lack of expertise, and being uncertain about the ordinance requirements make it difficult to lay out internal policies. If the details [of the law] are too complicated, SMEs may need to consult relevant lawyers for clarification," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok agreed that the new website can help SMEs understand the ordinance more thoroughly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some SMEs may have a basic understanding, but most do not fully understand the [ordinance] terms in detail and what it implies. The launch of the SME hub provides resources and guidance tailor-made for SMEs," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

 US President Donald Trump in his first day back in office on Monday signed an executive order directing the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), and from the Paris climate accord for a second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the White House hours after his inauguration, Trump said the United States was paying far more to the WHO compared to China, adding: "World Health ripped us off."

  The United States, the largest donor to the Geneva-based organisation, provides substantial financial support that is vital to the WHO's operations. Its withdrawal is expected to trigger a significant restructuring of the institution and could further disrupt global health initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Trump's announcement to exit the agency, the Foreign Ministry said the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the second time Trump has sought to sever ties with the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his new executive order, Trump directed agencies to "pause the future transfer of any United States government funds, support, or resources to the WHO" and to "identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also once again withdrew the United States from the Paris climate deal, removing the world's biggest historic emitter from global efforts to fight climate change for the second time in a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move places the United States alongside Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries in the world outside the 2015 pact, in which governments agreed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China is concerned about the US announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity, Guo said no country can stay aloof or unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's determination and actions to actively address climate change remain consistent," he said, adding that the Chinese side will work with all parties to actively tackle the challenges of climate change. (Agencies)

    CE hopes for 'good efforts' to promote ties with Trump

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his hope for promoting positive relations with Washington after US President Donald Trump returned to office for a second term, while saying Hong Kong would also "prepare for the worst".
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee also warned any political interference would not work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any political interference, any inappropriate action against Hong Kong will not work. We believe what we do is for the overall good of Hong Kong," Lee said when asked if he's worried about more sanctions on the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there is any attempt to interfere with trials in Hong Kong, or officials or people who are involved in administering justice, it won't work. We are doing it exactly in the same way in protecting our national security as other citizens in their own countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said he hopes to have a good relationship with the United States, as there are many common interests between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the new president in office, I hope to see that there will be good efforts to promote positive relations, because cooperation and collaboration will only create overall good for the people of Hong Kong and the people of the US. And Hong Kong people and US citizens have always been friends in a lot of areas and we'll continue to work hard on that regard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But, of course, we will always prepare for the worst, and we will ensure that the rights of our people and companies will be protected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR always seeks to strengthen ties and exchanges with different countries including the United States, the chief executive said, but there should be mutual respect and understanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday, Alan Lung, co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the SAR government may find it challenging to anticipate Trump's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government may not be able to read Trump, and doesn't understand what they [the administration] are worried about," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ross Feingold, Head of Research at Cyrus Consulting, felt the SAR could face an uphill battle when dealing with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is starting from a disadvantage, and we also have to keep in mind that no matter what he [Trump] says about his personal relationship with [President] Xi Jinping... Secretary of State (Marco) Rubio, who was just confirmed, the foreign policy team, these are people who don't have warm opinions towards Hong Kong."

    'Trump's speech has imperialistic overtures'

<img alt="Josef Gregory Mahoney says Donald Trump's inauguration speech had " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788447_1_20250121101535.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international relations professor on Tuesday said Donald Trump’s inauguration speech had "sort of imperialistic overtures".
 <br>
  <br>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai made the remarks on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme as the newly-sworn in US president vowed to “take back” the Panama Canal and potentially rename the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and invoked a “manifest destiny” in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if there's sort of this parallel that Trump is creating with this old 18th century idea of the US controlling the Western Hemisphere, at least the northern part of the Western Hemisphere, in as much as he's made overtures towards Greenland, Canada in terms of imperialistic overtures, but also things related to Mexico and now the Panama Canal and then renaming potentially the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One wonders if he’s creating sort of parallel with China where you have China in the South China Sea, China in the American mind trying to impose its sort of manifest destiny in East Asia.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney also pointed out that Trump made a wise move by holding back on tariffs against China, as the implementation would have roiled the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we all realised that tariffs are lose-lose at this point, that's what almost every study has confirmed,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And that the biggest losers of all are American consumers who end up paying essentially inflationary prices for products as much as they have to bear the costs of the tariffs. And the United States depends much more on products from China than vice versa.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Before taking office, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised Beijing for violating Hong Kong’s autonomy, saying it was now  a “semi-autonomous entity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahoney believes the statement will spark concerns towards how Washington will treat the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, you know, raises the spectre about whether or not the United States will start to treat Hong Kong as being part of the mainland and how that could have implications for the special status that Hong Kong has vis-a-vis the United States in terms of financial regulations,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That remains something of serious concern that we'll have to continue to watch. On the one hand, Rubio has said that he's committed to Hong Kong autonomy, but if he's decided that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous, then that raises a whole different perspective.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong will strengthen cooperation with other places to try to secure the release of SAR residents being held prisoner in "scam farms" in Southeast Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the moment, 10 Hongkongers are believed to be being forced to take part in fraud after being tricked into travelling to Thailand and neighbouring countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday that authorities will carry out thorough investigations and work with counterparts overseas to tackle the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are a lot of players in the whole fight against this crime, including law enforcement agencies in the relevant countries. There are good networks already. The respective countries have already heightened their attention and escalated the government participation in our whole fight," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen cooperation in this area, passing intelligence across the players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on the public to be aware of different types of scams, including those that have ensnared scores of university students from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People may have heard about such cases...but still they think they won't be the victims and so they are not as alert," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have strengthened cooperation with tertiary institutions to raise awareness of financial scams among students, Lee added.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said more than 1.4 million mainland arrivals are expected in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the administration will make comprehensive preparations to ensure travellers have a good experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The inter-departmental working group, chaired by the chief secretary, will make proper arrangements based on the situation during individual festive periods and the estimated traveller numbers," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding cross-border arrangements, we need to discuss and cooperate with mainland authorities. We will look at the actual situation to see whether service hours at border checkpoints need to be extended and how long these should be. We should be announcing the details within this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said 2025 will open a new page for Hong Kong with more tourists making frequent visits to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of inbound visits saw a huge surge last year, reaching almost 45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  While mainland arrivals saw a 30 percent year-on-year increase, the growth from Southeast Asia was even more significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he expects the growth to continue in the coming year, with more new air routes to be opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the chief executive also announced that twin panda cubs at Ocean Park will make their public debut on February 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said there would be a naming contest for the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope everyone can share the joy of this big family, so having a naming contest will make it even more joyful and warm. Details will be announced soon," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan arrived in Davos, Switzerland on Monday for the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting where he expressed his desire to expedite a free trade agreement between Hong Kong and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan met Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, the council's secretary-general, to discuss strengthening bilateral trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FS said both parties acknowledged that the launch of the "Gulf Cooperation Council Chapter" at the Asian Financial Forum last week marked a significant step forward in strengthening financial services cooperation between Hong Kong and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR government is committed to facilitating two-way business delegation visits to enhance collaboration in digital economy, green transformation, securities markets, Islamic finance, and asset and wealth management with Arab states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also met several finance and business leaders from Europe, America, the Middle East and Japan and promoted the SAR's advantages as a "super connector" and "super value-adder".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he briefed the leaders on Hong Kong's recent economic and social developments, highlighting progress in the local financial market last year and achievements in attracting businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised strategies to advance finance, innovation and technology, trade and aviation and create global opportunities for businesses and talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, Chan met the chair of Revolut, a UK-based fintech company specialising in digital banking services, to discuss the latest developments in the field and to encourage the company to expand its operations in Hong Kong.

    Badosa stuns Gauff to reach Aussie Open semi-finals

<img alt="Badosa (R) greets Coco Gauff after her quarter-final victory in the Australian Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788455_1_20250121110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An "emotional" Paula Badosa shattered world number three Coco Gauff's dream of a first Australian Open title when she stunned her 7-5, 6-4 in the quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badosa reached a Slam semi-final for the first time in her career -- the first Spanish woman to do so since Garbine Muguruza at Melbourne in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a bit emotional," said Badosa, who will face either two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a very emotional person. I wanted to play my best game. I think I did it – I'm super proud of the level I gave today," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a remarkable comeback to tennis for the 11th seed, who was ranked outside the top 100 a year ago after a stress fracture in her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean, a year ago, I was here with my back that I didn't know if I had to retire from this sport, and now I'm here playing against the best in the world," said Badosa. "I won today. I'm in a semi final. So I would never think that a year after I would be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third seed Gauff had been unbeaten in nine matches this season, but dropped her first set of 2025 before recovering to beat Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa began aggressively and had the Gauff serve under pressure early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff was serving at 5-5 30-40 when the Spaniard got the breakthrough on her third break-point opportunity and served out to take the opener in 56 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American, uncharacteristically, failed to create any break points in the first set and littered her game with unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa was relentless at the start of the second set in a marathon first game that lasted for 14 minutes and went to eight deuces. Gauff saved four break points but a fifth proved costly as the American went long to drop her serve again.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rasping running forehand winner and a backhand at the net put Gauff on the board and fired her up as broke back to level at 2-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Badosa powered to another two breaks and secured the match in one hour and 43 minutes, falling to the court in celebration as she registered her first win over a top-10 opponent at a Grand Slam in four attempts. (AFP)
