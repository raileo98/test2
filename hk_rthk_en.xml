<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

 Premier Li Qiang has signed a State Council decree unveiling revised measures on holiday arrangements, extending public holidays by two days.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lunar New Year holiday is extended from three days to four days, with the eve of the Lunar New Year added.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) says it will consider issuing a T3 on Wednesday afternoon as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to move towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it expects Toraji will skirt around 200 kilometres to the south of the territory on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the intensity of Toraji at that time, the distance of its associated gale winds from the Pearl River Estuary, and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals," said Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing T1 will remain in force until at least midday on Wednesday as Toraji is expected to maintain quite some distance from the SAR for the time being.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday, the HKO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday expressed confidence that Hong Kong's exchange traded-fund (ETF) market will continue to grow and reinforce the SAR's status as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Tracker Fund, Chan said the city has established itself as a leading ETF hub, offering a wide range of products and attracting many issuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created during the Asian financial crisis, the Tracker Fund has grown five-fold from an initial size of over HK$33 billion to become Hong Kong's largest ETF with a market cap of over HK$150 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, along with Hong Kong and our capital market, the Tracker Fund has demonstrated incredible resilience in navigating multiple challenges," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has earned the trust of local, mainland and international investors seeking exposure to Hang Seng Index's constituent stock. It offers investors a simple way to invest in a diversified portfolio of Hong Kong stocks, mitigating the risks of excessive concentration in a very cost-effective manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the fund's global footprint is expanding, including listings on the Thai stock exchange and a new ETF on the Saudi stock exchange.

 Former National People's Congress Standing Committee member Tam Yiu-chung on Tuesday called for stronger communication between the SAR government and the city’s business community, saying officials could do more to support local enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who's now vice-president of the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that a key message that Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Director Xia Baolong gave to local business leaders during a meeting last Friday, was for officials and businesses to work together to solve problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK programme, the veteran politician said the government could have done better in working hand-in-hand with businesspeople.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when the government is granting permits, can the relevant government departments carry out approvals more proactively, and not delay them for an unnecessarily long time?" Tam queried.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities should also understand that nowadays it is difficult to do business and the government should cooperate with the sector whenever it can to boost confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association Wingco Lo was among those attended the meeting with Xia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Xia noted that the logistics sector is one of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xia also mentioned that Hong Kong cannot go it alone. It has to work with the Greater Bay Area to form a port cluster, and cooperate with ports on the mainland to expand its transportation and logistics industry," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said there had been a "productive discussion" in Shenzhen on how the business community can leverage its expertise to help with the city's economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must enhance our status as a premier maritime and aviation hub, as well as a vital land gateway to the mainland," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber said apart from offering suggestions to the government, it will also organise overseas events to promote the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs has told business leaders to show their love for the SAR and take concrete action to promote the economy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held exchanges with 29 business and industrial representatives during a seminar in Shenzhen last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of a weekly Exco meeting, the CE said Xia's message to businesses is that they should contribute to the overall well-being of the Hong Kong "family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, enterprises can make their decisions. But the key point is how much you love this place and how much you think you should contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's just a business decision or whether you want to be showing your love to the people who live with you every day, showing your love to the home, which is the home for your children."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also told attendees to "wake up to the challenges and all collectively strengthen our competitiveness" while at the same time acknowledging the complexity of the world, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what kind of concrete action should be taken, Lee said entrepreneurs and investors could take forward projects in the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government is rolling out larger pieces of land for developers in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials will soon promulgate a new development blueprint on tourism which will cover various areas to upgrade and transform the industry.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The  Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) on Tuesday said that national carrier Air China would be the launch customer for the company's C929 wide-body aircraft under development that is designed to compete with twin-aisle models from Airbus and Boeing.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC's deputy director of marketing, Liu Yan, made the announcement at China's biggest air show in Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not disclose the number of aircraft Air China would purchase or planned delivery dates.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has said the C929 would have 280 to 400 seats and a range of 12,000 kilometres, which is in the same category as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The C929 was renamed in 2023 from the CR929 after Russia left a China-Russia joint venture developing the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report in April from the C929's fuselage manufacturer said it aimed to deliver the first fuselage section by September 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC deputy general manager Tong Yu in May told a group of Hong Kong reporters in Shanghai that a C929 prototype would be seen in the near future and estimated the jet could "soon" take a test flight. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind once more to preserve their 100 percent start to the season with a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, who overcame a 14-point deficit to beat Brooklyn on Saturday, were again forced to dig deep, battling back from nine points down in the third quarter for a road victory that takes them to 12-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led another fine all-round offensive performance from Cleveland, who have emerged as the surprise package of the season and are the only undefeated team in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six Cleveland players finished in double figures, with point guard Darius Garland adding 17 points and Evan Mobley 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and Ty Jerome all had 12 points each off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago meanwhile were left ruing their inability to take full advantage after pulling into an 85-76 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Cleveland came roaring back with a 9-0 run to tie the game and then pulled ahead to lead by three points heading into the fourth quarter, before closing out victory by outscoring Chicago 24-21 in the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zach LaVine led Chicago's scorers with 26 points, while Coby White and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points apiece. The Bulls fell to 4-7 with the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We dug deep," Mitchell said after the win. "Honestly, the bench saved us. Starters were a little fatigued, and I guess teams are coming at us. But we persevered, and shoutout to the bench for that – it's a group effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us to continue to be what we want to be, that's what it's going to take," he added. "It was a complete team win – every night it's somebody different. We're playing for each other, being selfless. We've got to keep it going." (AFP)

    'Mutual respect key for Hong Kong-US relations'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday called for mutual respect from the United States in its relationship with Hong Kong, saying bilateral trade is "beneficial" to both sides.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said no country should interfere in the city's internal affairs, in response to a question before his weekly Executive Council meeting relating to potential policies to be introduced under US President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Trump's first tenure in the White House, he signed an order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, while imposing sanctions on officials or former officials from the SAR and mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any country or economy which wants to develop trade relations or normal relations with another economy, then mutual respect is important. There should be respect so that there will be non-interference with local affairs, internal affairs. And also, Hong Kong attaches great importance to the rule of law," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge all economies or countries to adopt that principle to develop relations with Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has enjoyed significant economic benefits in Hong Kong with a trade surplus totalling US$270 billion over the past decade, Lee noted, adding that more than 1,200 American companies have set up operations in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These figures demonstrate the close economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of US businesses in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive added Hong Kong has all along supported multilateral trade while welcoming exchanges with different economies, including the US.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizeable delegations from many Asian countries and territories will be converging this week on the Peruvian city of Lima for this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit – including ones led by President Xi Jinping and Chief Executive John Lee.
 <br>
  <br>
  The influx of Asian visitors will be a bit of an anomaly for the South American country – since tourists from Asia normally make up just 3.4 percent of all international arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s a figure that Peru – for which tourism is the third-biggest industry – wants to pump up.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some Chinese migrants to the country who believe there’s growing interest among Asian travellers in making the long and expensive trip to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alicia Tay moved to Peru in 1983 and now runs a travel agency in Lima specialising in MICE tourism – catering to business travellers attending  meetings, conferences and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted a growing number of Chinese firms wishing to bring their employees to Peru and other parts of South America in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of our customers have travelled extensively around the world, such as Europe and of course Asia. Even the United States and Canada, many have been to these places. But for South America, it is certainly a new destination for them,” Tay explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, she said many Peruvian holidaymakers are curious about Asia, and see mainland China and Hong Kong as places with cutting-edge technology. There are also businessmen who are looking for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the Peruvians consider China as a potential country [to invest in] industries and technologies. I think it’s a point of interest, they want to visit China,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peruvian government has been going all out in recent years to lure tourists, telling them there’s much more to see than just the ancient Inca town of Machu Picchu.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a lucrative business after all: holidaymakers who are willing to travel halfway across the world to Peru usually have deep pockets. That includes Hue, a visitor from Sydney, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for a 19-day South American tour to see Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls, mainly for sightseeing,” she said, adding she was planning to spend nearly US$10,000 for the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Do I think it's worth it? Look, I think it is. I mean, for me, experience is more valuable than goods, so that's where I splurge my money.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen natives Rachel and her sister planned to spend even more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s around US$30,000, because we have a plan to go to Antarctica, I think that costs a lot. It takes around 28 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru hopes that the Apec meetings, which is held in Lima for the third time since 2008, will further raise the nation’s profile and attract more visitors and even investment.

 Chief Executive John Lee plans to garner support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) during a high-level summit in Peru this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is leaving for Lima to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference (Apec), also said on Tuesday that he is going to meet with other leaders to promote the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst in Lima, I'm going to attend a number of events and activities, including internal meetings and other sessions. I will also be exchanging views with other economic leaders, so that I can tell the good stories of Hong Kong and explain our advantages to other countries. We can also enhance ties with other governments," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a number of entities in Apec which are members of RCEP. I will make use of this occasion to strive for early accession to RCEP."
  <br>
  <br>
  Visiting South America for the first time since taking office, Lee said there's room for further development between the SAR and the continent, on top of already established trade ties.

    Ohtani nominated for MVP after historic 2024 campaign

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was named among the nominees for Major League Baseball's National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday after a historic debut season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is bidding for back-to-back MVP honours after winning the award last season while playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the American League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, who has already won two MVP awards in his career, is coming off a season which saw him become the first player in history to amass 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old slugger also helped the Dodgers claim a second World Series in five seasons in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani faces competition from shortstop Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the American League meanwhile, New York Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Juan Soto were nominated alongside Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MVP awards, which are voted on by a ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWA), will be announced on November 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the nominees announced for the National League manager of the year award, with the Dodgers' World Series-winning manager Dave Roberts failing to make the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roberts was tipped to be among the favourites after guiding the Dodgers to an MLB-best 98 regular season wins, despite having a pitching staff decimated by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Roberts missed out, with Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets, the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Murphy and the San Diego Padres' Mike Shildt named as the nominees. (AFP)

    Storm Toraji expected to come within 200km of HK

<img alt="The observatory says it may issue a T3 signal during the day on Wednesday, and possibly a higher signal on Thursday when Toraji is expected to pass within 200km of the city. Image courtesy of HKO" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778637_1_20241112094607.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will consider issuing the T3 storm signal on Wednesday as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji continues to make its way towards Hong Kong, with the system expected to come within 200 kilometres of the territory on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters say whether a higher warning signal will be needed then depends on Toraji’s intensity and the strength of the winds here.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Tuesday, Toraji is expected to remain too far away to bring any major impact to the city, and the observatory says the Standby Signal No. 1 will remain in force for the entire day.
  <br>
  <br>
  But winds are expected to strengthen on Wednesday as Toraji approaches, coupled with the effects of the northeast monsoon, so the observatory will consider issuing the T3 warning during the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory also warned people to stay away from the shoreline and to avoid water sports for the time being.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they've laid a holding charge of murder against three men, aged between 58 and 63, and the case will be mentioned at Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three men were arrested on Sunday in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man in Castle Peak the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 59-year-old man who was arrested earlier in connection with the case has been released on bail, and is required to report back in early December.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner spent his first rest day at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday collecting the trophy for finishing the year ranked the number one tennis player in the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner entered the season-ending event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult," Sinner added, calling himself "very lucky".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian, who won his first match at finals on Sunday against Australian Alex De Minaur, succeeds Serbia's Novak Djokovic, who finished the year as world number one a record eight times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boris Becker, who spent 221 days at number one in 1991 but never ended a year on top, attended the presentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while "there are certainly Carlos Alcaraz and others, Jannik is going to be world number one for a long time." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Florida Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state, The New York Times reported on Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  It quoted three people as saying that the decision is not final, but that Trump appears to have settled on Rubio, a loyalist whom Trump passed over as his vice presidential running mate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has moved quickly to staff his incoming administration, naming loyalists to several key posts within days of his election victory and signalling his desire to have some seated without a Senate confirmation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The staffing picks are the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny, with Trump vowing that his second administration will oversee a radical shake-up of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old Republican tycoon said Sunday he would tap hardline immigration official Tom Homan as the country's "border czar," while US media reported the nod for UN ambassador as going to New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a vocal Trump ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Miller, another fierce critic of illegal immigration who served in Trump's first administration, has been tapped for deputy chief of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The picks signal movement on a number of Trump's key campaign messages, with Homan's hardline immigration stance making him a loyal hand in carrying out the incoming president's deportation promises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik, who has voiced strong support for Israel, will represent the administration as the UN grapples with the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik's nomination would need approval by the Senate, but Trump is hoping to bypass Congress by making appointments while the chamber is in recess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another hardliner, Florida congressman Michael Waltz, is reportedly in line to take the crucial National Security Advisor role, according to The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will not be inaugurated until January, and had previously made one cabinet-level appointment, naming his campaign manager Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. (AFP)

    Japan's re-elected PM Ishiba vows to step up reform

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to take tougher measures against misuse of political funds after he was re-elected by parliament on Monday following a major loss in the polls last month by his governing coalition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost a majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the October 27 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was blamed on voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must remind ourselves of the basics that politics is for the people, as we tackle political and party reforms," Ishiba said. He said that in response to the poor election results, "We must be able to have empathy for the pain, sorrow and anger of the people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A special parliamentary session convened on Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his second Cabinet in just over a month, Ishiba reappointed most of its previous members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaced three ministers who lost seats or were affected by the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba stressed the importance of pursuing the significant buildup of Japan's defence power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he plans to attend Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits later this month to strengthen partnership with the Global South nations and the Asia-Pacific region. He said he will hold talks with US President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  His government is also reportedly arranging a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. (AP)

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

 Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler on Monday called on Israel to respect Iran's sovereignty and refrain from attacking Iranian soil, highlighting warming ties between the Middle East rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders that the international community should oblige Israel "to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Opening the summit, he said the international community must "immediately halt the Israeli actions against our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon", condemning Israel's campaign in Gaza as "genocide".
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Saudi Arabia) affirms its support for the brothers in Palestine and Lebanon to overcome the disastrous humanitarian consequences of the ongoing Israeli aggression," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draft resolution for the summit stresses "firm support" for "national rights" for the Palestinian people, "foremost among which is their right to freedom and to an independent, sovereign state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, newly appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it was not "realistic" to establish a Palestinian state, dismissing it as a "Hamas state".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think this position is realistic today and we must be realistic," Saar said in response to a question during an appearance in Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi foreign ministry announced plans for the summit in late October during a meeting, also in Riyadh, of a new "international alliance" to press for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes one year after a similar gathering in Riyadh of the Cairo-based Arab League and the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation during which leaders condemned Israeli forces' actions in Gaza as "barbaric". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Monday that the Standby Signal No 1, which took effect at 10.20pm, will remain in force until at least noon on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecasters said they'll consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said according to the present forecast track, the storm may be relatively close to the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the distance between Toraji and the Pearl River Estuary at that time, its intensity and the change in local wind conditions," the observatory said in its storm warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said members of the public should be aware of stronger winds and stay away from the shoreline because of swells.

 Police on Monday brought one of the four suspects in a murder case in Tuen Mun to the scene of the crime as part of their investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was handcuffed and wearing a black hood, was taken to Yau Oi Estate Market under police supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, officers arrested four men, aged between 58 and 64, in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police allege the suspects beat up the victim outside the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later fell unconscious at home and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said preliminary investigations suggested the suspects did not know the victim, and the case did not involve triad activities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real estate and Macau gaming tycoon Lui Che-woo has died at the age of 95, one of his listed firms announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Galaxy Entertainment Group said he passed away peacefully last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Lui's] vision, tremendous leadership and guidance were the foundations for the Group’s development and continued success," the group said in a filing to the stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The board would like to express its deepest sorrow for the passing away of Lui and extends its deepest condolences to his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said it will continue its operations in accordance to the strategies laid down by its board, adding that Lui's passing won't have any impact on how the group is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tycoon made his last public appearance in late September when a host of local celebrities joined him in a party celebrating his birthday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui was also the chairman of the K. Wah Group, a multinational conglomerate he founded in the 1950s, focusing on construction materials and quarry mining.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later expanded his business into real estate investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides various housing and hotel developments in Hong Kong, K. Wah also holds projects in major mainland cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou, as well as Singapore and Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, Lui ventured into Macau's gaming business, winning one of the gambling licences issued by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His group now owns six casinos there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost a decade ago, the businessman founded a prize under his own name, recognising people who have contributed to the world civilisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2012, Lui was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the city's top honour, for his contributions to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had also been a member of the local Election Committee, as well as a member of the national advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui is survived by his wife and five children.

    China announces anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Monday announced it will impose temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports from the European Union (EU).
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said the decision follows a preliminary investigation that found EU brandy producers were dumping certain products in China, threatening to cause substantial damage to the domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Importers of brandy originating in the EU must place deposits with Chinese customs based on dumping margins of between 30.6 percent and 39 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures apply to grape-based spirits in containers less than 200 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures follow a similar announcement made by the ministry on October 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether these measures – which will come into effect on Friday – were new or an extension of existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Europe's leading producer of brandy, had described the measures announced last month as political after the EU imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles over unfair competition claims. (Xinhua/AFP)

    UN climate talks off to rocky start

<img alt="COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev addresses the opening of the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Azerbaijan. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778581_1_20241111212523.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The COP29 talks opened on Monday with calls for global cooperation and fresh warnings about climate disasters, but proceedings quickly ground to a halt in a fight over the agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump's re-election is already hanging over the talks in Baku where negotiators are meant to agree new funding for climate action in poorer countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they opened, UN climate chief Simon Stiell told countries: "Now is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count."
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned rich countries struggling to agree a new funding target to "dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the official proceedings in the capital of oil- and gas-rich Azerbaijan stalled almost immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're not going to resume until they resolve... the agenda," said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate change think tank E3G.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 president "can't put negotiating teams to work" until they adopt it, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators must increase a US$100 billion-a-year target to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  How much will be on offer, who will pay, and who can access the funds are some of the major points of contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries are pushing for trillions of dollars and insist money should be mostly grants rather than loans, but negotiators are tight-lipped over what final figure might emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev acknowledged the need was "in the trillions" but said a more "realistic goal" was somewhere in the hundreds of billions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These negotiations are complex and difficult," the former executive of Azerbaijan's national oil company said at the opening of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries warn that without adequate finance, they will struggle to offer ambitious updates to their climate goals, which countries are required to submit by early next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global North owes the global South a climate debt," said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not leave this COP if the ambition level on the finance... doesn't match the scale at which finance must be delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The small group of developed countries that currently contributes the money wants the donor pool expanded to include other rich nations and top emitters, including China and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is firmly rejected by Beijing, with one Chinese official warning on Sunday during a closed-door session that the talks should not aim to "re-negotiate" existing agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a handful of leaders from the Group of 20, whose countries account for nearly 80 percent of global emissions, are attending. US President Joe Biden is staying away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan will however be sending a delegation for the first time since the Taliban took power. They are expected to have observer status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats have insisted that the absences, and Trump's win, will not detract from the serious work at hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come with fresh warnings that the world is far off track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN said Monday that 2024 is on track to break new temperature records, and the Paris climate agreement's goals were now "in great peril".
  <br>
  <br>
  The period from 2015 to 2024 will also be the warmest decade ever recorded, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a new report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The climate deal commits to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, preferably below 1.5C.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the world tops that level this year, it would not be an immediate breach of the Paris deal, which measures temperatures over decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it suggests much greater climate action is needed. (AFP)

    'Trump's victory won't diminish Sino-US tensions'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Monday said Donald Trump's victory in the American presidential election will not diminish Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the US-China tension will not change with the new president," Tang told reporters after attending a forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We always wish to cooperate and work with all the people in the world and live peacefully for the benefit of the people. But that’s not how a lot of Americans are thinking, and it is a cross-party interest. So I don’t think the tension will diminish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, I do think, I do hope that Trump will be more a US president as in being a businessman, meaning consider the interest of the people over the interest of who's threatening who."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hong Kong will face a "very challenging" situation due to tensions between China and the US. But the former chief secretary said the SAR has always survived in challenging situations and the city will overcome this time through the collective efforts of everyone in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tang said he believes Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong hopes the local business sector will seek changes through reform and take concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia told the SAR's business community during a closed-door meeting in Shenzhen last Friday that they are the "main force" in promoting the SAR's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hongkongers are always very patriotic and "very astute businessmen".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course support the Central People's Government and we are always supporters of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Xia Baolong. So, I'm sure all of those who went [to the meeting] will take his advice to heart and consider their actions and how to demonstrate that they have actually put into concrete action their support for the government and for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said both government and business have to work together to boost economic development.

 The observatory on Monday said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued at 10.20pm as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm has passed over the Philippine island of Luzon and will come within 800 kilometres of the SAR overnight, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of Toraji and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.

    Parliament re-elects Ishiba as Japan PM in runoff vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese lawmakers voted on Monday for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to stay on as leader, after his scandal-tarnished coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a lower house election last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba, who called the snap poll after taking office on October 1, must now run a fragile minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito won the biggest bloc of seats in the election but lost the majority held since 2012, leaving him beholden to small opposition parties to pass his policy agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining that fragility, Monday's vote in parliament, broadcast on television, went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, with no candidate able to muster majority support in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ishiba eventually prevailed as expected, garnering 221 votes, well clear of his nearest challenger, ex-PM Yoshihiko Noda, the head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, but still short of a majority in the 465-seat lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan will hold elections next year for the less powerful upper house, where the ruling coalition's slim majority could also be at risk if Ishiba cannot revive public trust roiled by a scandal over unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His imminent challenge is compiling a supplementary budget for the fiscal year through March, under pressure from voters and opposition parties to raise spending on welfare and take steps to offset rising prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  For approval he needs the backing of at least one opposition party, which is most likely to be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) headed by Yuichiro Tamaki.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has held co-operation talks with Ishiba, but DPP lawmakers on Friday did not vote for Ishiba to stay on as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tamaki is also in a precarious position after admitting on Monday to an extramarital affair revealed in a tabloid magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his premiership confirmed, Ishiba now has to prepare for a slate of international engagements, including a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Brazil on November 18 and 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also trying to arrange a stopover in the United States on the way to or from that gathering to meet Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Japanese officials fear Trump might again hit Tokyo with protectionist trade measures and revive demands for it to pay more for the cost of stationing US forces there.
  <br>
  <br>
  These issues were largely smoothed over in Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, by the close ties between the president and Japan's then-premier, Shinzo Abe, a bond Ishiba seems keen to re-establish. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said bringing more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong helps the government get closer to the vision of the city becoming an innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief made the comment at a signing ceremony involving the government's Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) and 17 companies from sectors including life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, fintech, advance manufacturing and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the companies in attendance, along with about 50 that got on board earlier, billions of dollars of investment are expected in the coming years, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the first two batches of partners, more than HK$42 billion of investment will be made and over 17,000 jobs will be created in the coming few years. It is particularly heartening to note that about 90 percent of the new batch of enterprises are planning to set up their international or regional headquarters here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said almost all of the enterprises attracted earlier have commenced operations in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 percent have chosen to set up their offices at either the Science Park or Cyberport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prophesee – a French company that builds vision sensors that mimic the way the human eye works – was one of the enterprises that recently signed a partnership with the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO and co-founder Luca Verre said the company has offices in Shanghai, Japan and the US and was thrilled to grow its presence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's a unique hub for the company to address the largest market opportunity for the company, which is the Asia-Pacific market, in particular, the mainland China market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides looking for market growth, Verre also said he's confident that the research capabilities of the city will help in developing the firm's technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always extremely attractive to work with top researchers to push the boundaries of this technology... and actually it turned out that Hong Kong has an incredible ecosystem from that point of view because within a relatively small area, actually the top five universities of Hong Kong are today doing some research related directly or indirectly within neuromorphic technologies," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, Dennis Lo, on Monday said the body's annual tech awards are paramount for the development of the local science and technology sector and supporting the local economy's transformation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who is a molecular biologist and the incoming head of Chinese University, was speaking as the alliance gave out five awards on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these young people in innovation and technology are the future of the industry in Hong Kong. Their ability to innovate and passion for research are important in advancing the sector's development for the SAR, and even that for the country," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope this award can serve as a fuelling station in their marathon career in innovation and technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed hope that the awards will bring the scientists more resources and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty, won in the artificial intelligence and robotics category, while Ng Siew-chien, Chinese University's medical school assistant dean, took home the prize in life and health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Chen Shih-chi from Chinese University's mechanical and automation engineering department won the prize in advanced manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The award for new materials and new energy went to City University chemistry professor Zhang Hua, while City University computer science scholar Wang Cong grabbed the fintech award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners also received HK$2 million each as part of their prizes.

    People urged to watch out for online investment fraud

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday urged people to think twice before turning to social media or web forums for financial advice after the force recorded around 3,500 cases of online investment fraud in the first nine months of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the losses reported reached HK$2.2 billion in total, although both the amount of money swindled and the number of cases dropped by around 20 percent compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Wan Pik-yee said there is a rising trend of fraudsters pretending to be police officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They opened some WhatsApp groups using our logo as their profile picture to persuade the victims to believe that they are really police officers and ask them to provide some bank account details to scam their money," Wan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Yeung, head of investor education and stakeholder engagements at the Investor and Financial Education Council said more people have been scammed this year after falling for fake adverts online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Listening or looking into the advice that is given on social media, I don't think there's anything wrong. But when it comes to asking you to join a group or click on any links, that's when it's really a problem," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with whatever information that we get from the social media or from online, it's always worth to look into alternative sources just to verify whether that information is for real."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's much-anticipated J-35A stealth aircraft is set to make its debut on Tuesday at the country's biggest civil and military air show - the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stealth fighter jet made its first public appearance on Friday, with broadcaster CCTV saying the jet appeared over the Zhuhai Jinwan Airport and conducted its first field adaptation training.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the centrepiece of this week's Zhuhai air show, which also marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).
  <br>
  <br>
  It will include a flying display. Another variant, the J-35, is designed for use with China's aircraft carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35 and J-35A are designed and built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Daily news outlet said ahead of the air show that the J-35A "mainly carries out the task of seizing and maintaining air supremacy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both J-35 variants are considerably smaller than China's other stealth aircraft, the land-based J-20 fighter. An estimated 200 J-20s are operational with the PLAAF.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35A is superficially similar to the Lockheed Martin F-35, whose shape - from fuselage to control surfaces - is designed to minimise how large it appears on radar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition takes place in Zhuhai from November 12-17. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on the business sector and entrepreneurs to actively contribute to Hong Kong's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum, the SAR leader said businesspeople should take action to build up their industries, not stand idly by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The business sector and entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are both participants in and beneficiaries of Hong Kong's development. They should be contributors rather than bystanders. They shouldn't just be commentators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In economic transitions, every industry in Hong Kong should start with themselves, taking actions to grasp opportunities for transformation, building Hong Kong with concrete actions, to develop and construct the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said his administration will transform the power of patriotism into concrete action to ensure long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government will continue to tackle obstacles and be innovative, and will make use of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has to expand its global network to tell good stories of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he hopes society and professional media practitioners will promote the region's advantages, achievements and opportunities to the world.

    Think tank suggests regular youth uniformed group day

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A youth think tank on Monday called on the government to regularly hold a “youth uniformed group day” to raise awareness and break stereotypes about such groups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Youth I.D.E.A.S, under the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said it recently surveyed 1,001 people aged 12 to 26 and most respondents said they believe joining a uniformed group helps improve teamwork, discipline and a sense of responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that almost 55 percent of the respondents were current or former members of a uniformed group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who had never joined a uniformed group, the main reasons cited were that they participated in other extracurricular activities, were worried about the time commitment or felt that it wasn’t required by their schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Cheng from the think tank said many people have a limited understanding of uniformed groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So they may not encourage their children to join the uniformed groups, but we think it will be important to have different channels for youngsters to explore their potential. So one of our suggestions would be to have a regular uniformed group day so as to let the public know more of what exactly the uniformed groups can serve and can connect to a community,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said a regular uniformed group day would also give young people a chance to serve the community and utilise their skills, such as teaching people about first aid and sharing health tips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has 19 community and government youth uniformed groups with about 280,000 members between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said in its Youth Development Blueprint two years ago that it planned to get more young people to join such groups.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    'Step up training on use of cage lifts in emergencies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Monday stressed it is crucial to step up workers' training on the use of cage lifts in emergency situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment on an RTHK radio programme. This came as a worker lost his life after he was crushed by a cage lift at The Pavilia Farm construction site in Tai Wai on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even experienced operators use different kinds of machines at different construction sites. When they're working at a new construction site, or when they have to use a new model of the equipment, they should receive training from scratch," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from training workers in how to operate the equipment, I believe it's more important that they know how to stop the machine in emergencies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kwong-sing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner's Education and Training Committee, said on the same programme it is rare for interlocking device at cage lifts to malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we are carrying out safety checks at construction sites, we found out that for convenience, a lot of workers would jam up the safety lock. I've even seen some workers tamper with the control box, causing the safety installation to become useless."
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident was the third fatal industrial accident in five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man succumbed to his injuries after he fell from height at a construction site at the airport last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old victim is believed to be from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu pointed out that the industry has to strengthen communication with workers from the mainland, even if they have relevant experience before coming to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a totally different culture in Hong Kong - whether it's the mode of communication or jargon - they are very different. Training has to be stepped up in advance and ensure that mainland workers understand the instructions and are clear about the working procedures."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued between 8pm and midnight on Monday as a typhoon is about to enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 1pm, Toraji was centred about 250 kilometres north of Manila and was forecast to move west-northwest at about 18 kilometres per hour across Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the Observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters added that the storm could be relatively close to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the combined effect of the storm and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers.

    EOC not doing enough in discrimination cases: Unison

<img alt="Hong Kong Unison's executive director, John Tse, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but people were still being denied service because of their disabilities.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating racial equality said on Monday that an incident in which a woman was denied service in a restaurant last week because of her wheelchair showed that Hongkongers needed more education on the issue, and accused the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) of not doing enough to help victims of such incidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The wheelchair incident involving Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei has turned the spotlight on the SAR's treatment of the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Tse, the executive director of Hong Kong Unison, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but these problems kept cropping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirty years later we still have this kind of discrimination happening in Hong Kong and it's totally unacceptable," Tse told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the EOC had to do more to promote and educate HongKongers and keep them informed of any action that it took after such incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the catering sector drew fire after last week's incident, Tse said these problems weren't limited to restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a separate incident earlier this year in which two visually disabled people were forced to leave a flight in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No action was ever taken. The two people complained to the EOC. What did they do? Well, nothing much, they just dismissed it," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi's goal of winning the MLS Cup title came to an abrupt end on Saturday with his Inter Miami suffering a shock first-round elimination from the playoffs after a 3-2 home defeat to Atlanta United FC.
 <br>
  <br>
  Miami had won the regular season campaign with a record points total but after losing twice in the best-of-three series, the MLS Cup favourites and their eight-times Ballon d'Or winner are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the accolades Miami received for their regular season 'Supporters' Shield' triumph count for little after an Atlanta team which finished ninth in the Eastern Conference pulled off a stunning upset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter took the lead in the 17th minute when Messi was denied by a diving save from Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan but Matías Rojas followed in to slot home the loose ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Messi who finally broke through in the 65th minute, meeting a Marcelo Weigandt cross from the right with a thundering header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami pushed forward in search of the winner but instead they were caught out once again with Pedro Amador's cross from the left headed home at the back post by Polish midfielder Bartosz Slisz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter players were furious that the referee had allowed play to continue while their defender Tomás Avilés lay injured on the floor but their frustration was in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final whistle brought a deflated silence over Chase Stadium as Miami's season, which so many had expected would end with their first MLS Cup title, concluded with the sight of Guzan and his Atlanta team-mates celebrating.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Miami head coach Gerardo Martino, who won MLS Cup with Atlanta in 2018, an inquest is sure to follow but he tried to put a brave face on the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season has had good and bad things. If you think about where we were in November last year, there has obviously been progress in terms of the club, not just the team," he said. "If you think about the expectations we had for this playoffs, obviously we came up a little short," said the Argentine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martino said there was a despondent mood in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are sad, as they should be when there are so many expectations and the team can't fulfil them," he added. "In this final part of the year we got used to achieving the objectives but we couldn't achieve the most important one." (AFP)

    Chiefs escape Broncos to remain unbeaten on season

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten start to the NFL season after blocking a last-gasp field goal to snatch a dramatic 16-14 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reigning Super Bowl champions looked poised to suffer their first defeat of the campaign after rookie Broncos quarterback Bo Nix expertly engineered a late fourth-quarter drive to the Kansas City 17-yard line.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left Wil Lutz with what should have been a straightforward 35-yard chip shot to win the game with the final kick of an absorbing clash at Arrowhead Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lutz and the Broncos were left stunned after Chiefs' defensive end Mike Danna got a hand to the kick to block the attempt and leave Kansas City exhaling a collective sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes raced across the field in celebration with his teammates as Kansas City sealed a win that sees them improve to 9-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just speaks to this entire team," Mahomes said of Kansas City's great escape. "I felt offensively we didn't do enough. Defensively we stepped it up in the second half, and then special teams – we're a full team. It's everybody, it was a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody believes, no one has any doubts, we just keep pushing and we found a way in the end," the 29-year-old Mahomes added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was hard on Broncos signal-caller Nix, who had shown superb composure throughout to help Denver take a 14-3 second quarter lead thanks to touchdown passes wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Courtland Sutton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's defense, meanwhile, gave Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a torrid time, sacking the Kansas City quarterback four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes, though, gradually got his team back into the game, connecting with Travis Kelce for a touchdown that made it 14-10 at the half, before two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half gave them a slender 16-14 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nix then appeared to have done enough to give Denver a chance at winning the game, only for the blocked field goal drama to deny the Broncos a famous win. (AFP)

    Man Utd win to end Van Nistelrooy's interim tenure

<img alt="Van Nistelrooy celebrates on pitch after the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778469_1_20241111083242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy said his four games as interim manager of Manchester United was a "short but amazing period" after ending his run unbeaten with a 3-0 victory over Leicester on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, who remains a legend at Old Trafford for his goal return during a glorious playing career, also oversaw victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League either side of a 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim will be in charge when the Red Devils next take the field away to Ipswich in two weeks' time, with Van Nistelrooy's own future still unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did a good job," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period," he added. "We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs, and help the club which is important."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment," he went on to say. "To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes continued his scoring streak under Van Nistelrooy with a powerful effort for his fourth goal in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his 250th appearance for the club, Fernandes also had a hand in the second goal as his header was deflected into his own net by Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho then came off the bench to rifle in a brilliant third goal as United shrugged off their problems in front of goal so far this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils remain down in 13th in the Premier League table but are only four points adrift of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy returned to the club where he scored 150 goals in June as an assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision is yet to be made over whether he will have a role in Amorim's coaching team but the 48-year-old is proud of the work he has done in recent weeks to stabilise the club in troubled times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We tried to stabilise after a difficult and emotional period. We wanted to get players performing at their best, we got the right feeling to them and got them believing in themselves," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This spell was a big responsibility, and I took it very seriously," Van Nistelrooy went on to say. "I wanted to help and get United into a better place – that was my goal. With three wins and a draw it's a standard where you want to grow to as a club." (AFP)

    Arsenal draw with Chelsea, Ipswich stun Spurs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal and Chelsea are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their 1-1 draw on Sunday, while Ipswich stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League victory in 22 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are now winless in four Premier League games, as their bid for a first title since 2004 is at risk of unravelling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners welcomed captain Martin Odegaard back to the starting line-up for the first time in two months and were much improved at Stamford Bridge, but still could not come away with a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very unlucky. We have dominated one of the best teams in Europe but we don't get the results – that is what is missing," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after the derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard teed up Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring with a near-post shot on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea responded through Pedro Neto's brilliant long-range effort for his first league goal since a US$66 million move from Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has two new worries to add to what he describes as a nightmare run of injuries, after Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice both failed to finish the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice went off after 71 minutes, and Saka was replaced 10 minutes later with both sustaining knocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good because for two players of that importance to say they want to come off is unusual," Arteta told reporters. "I don't expect them to be fit for the international break."
  <br>
  <br>
  A share of the spoils sees the Blues remain ahead of Arsenal on goal difference as both sides move into the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ipswich will play host to Ruben Amorim's first match as Manchester United manager in two weeks, and go into that game buoyed by their first win since ending a two-decade wait to return to the top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive moment – one to cherish," said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sammie Szmodics took advantage of statuesque Tottenham defending to open the scoring with an overhead kick on 31 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liam Delap doubled the visitors' lead in far less spectacular fashion as he lashed in from point-blank range after Radu Dragusin directed a cross towards his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs had come back to win in eight of the previous 12 league matches they conceded first at home this year but this time left themselves with too much to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Bentancur reduced the arrears with a powerful header from Pedro Porro's corner but they fell to a fifth league defeat in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner got his bid for a first ATP Finals title underway with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur on Sunday as former champion Daniil Medvedev lost his head during his defeat to Taylor Fritz.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner delighted supporters in Turin with a comfortable win over Finals debutant De Minaur to move first in the Ilie Nastase Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one, who hadn't played since winning the Shanghai Masters last month, only had one brief scare when his serve was broken early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he quickly recovered to rattle off four straight games and take the opening set to 5-2 before closing it out with his first set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner closed out a routine victory in emphatic fashion with a perfect service game and basked in the applause of his home fans after smashing an ace to finish in style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner, who lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, tops the world rankings after a stunning season in which he claimed the Australian and US Opens – his first Grand Slam victories – and won five more ATP titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, world number four Daniil Medvedev boiled with anger during his 6-4, 6-3 loss to American Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev destroyed his racket after going a set down and things went from bad to worse when Fritz broke serve to take a 4-2 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev was docked a penalty point for throwing his racket at a courtside microphone and during game seven of the second set he held a new racket by its head while waiting for Fritz's serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the match Medvedev, whose behaviour was jeered by the crowd, replied "100 percent" when asked if he was hoping for the end of the season to come along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired to fight against something that doesn't depend on myself," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll see how it goes," he added. "Today actually I had my chances. I'll have them the next matches – if it doesn't work out, I go on holiday. I'm happy." (AFP)

    HK eyeing free trade agreement with Peru: TDC

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government is looking to finalise a free trade agreement with Peru, as Chief Executive John Lee heads to the South American nation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ meeting this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trade Development Council (TDC) also hopes a brand new port near the Peruvian capital of Lima will provide fresh impetus for cargo trade between the two regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America, with over HK$5 billion worth of merchandise trade last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Latin American nations are rich in natural resources, they rely heavily on imports for some daily necessities such as clothing and household appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Alice Tsang, who leads the global research team at TDC, expects more Hong Kong businesses to tap into the Peruvian market once a free trade agreement is signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From what we see in Peru, there is room to further boost spending among general consumers. After the Covid pandemic, there is demand for high-end products,” she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang added that Peruvian department stores have been sourcing products in Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asia. Some develop their in-house brands whose products are manufactured by SAR companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A free trade agreement can facilitate these exchanges by spelling out the legal framework and government regulations. I believe more Hong Kong companies will be willing to tap into this emerging market,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a 2022 document published by the Trade and Industry Department, the proposed free trade agreement seeks to eliminate or reduce tariffs, facilitate customs procedures, as well as improve market access for both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner globally, with bilateral trade reaching some US$37 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a massive Pacific coastline, Peru’s strategic importance in cargo trade was recognised by China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO, a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major undertaking, the firm in 2021 began the construction of Chankay port, located around 80km north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once a remote fishing village, Chankay has been transformed into a natural deep-water port and could serve as a crucial gateway for shipments in and out of Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port began its soft launch this month, and a massive container ship was docked there during a visit by RTHK on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang explained that once the port becomes operational, the shipment time between Shanghai and Peru can be slashed by one week. The time savings also translate to a one-third reduction in operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The cooperation between China and Peru is mutually beneficial. Many consumer goods in Peru arrive from China and Asia. Following the construction of Chankay port, a container ship will be able to reach Peru from Shanghai in 28 days, down from the current 35 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That reduces costs by more than 30 percent, because less fuel is used and the insurance would be cheaper due to less time spent at sea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist believes the project may not be necessarily linked to the trade tensions between China and the United States. She explained that after Covid, nations around the world realised the need to diversify supply chains to reduce risks and minimise disruptions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level." (Reuters)

    Russia, Ukraine exchange massive drone attacks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring a woman and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, while a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine, officials reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  A top UK defence official meanwhile said that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since their full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief of the UK defence staff, Tony Radakin, said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded “every single day,” bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying “an extraordinary price" for the war, even as a gruelling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the losses were for “tiny increments of land,” and that Moscow's mounting defence and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for “as long as it takes” to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of US President-elect Donald Trump have signalled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following “human wave” attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a “record” 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were “lost”, the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Governor Oleh Kiper reported. (AP)

    Dozens dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Lebanon

<img alt="The first strike early on Sunday completely demolished a house in Jabalia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778426_1_20241110192106.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched deadly strikes on Gaza and Lebanon on Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers in Gaza on Sunday said 30 people, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first strike early on Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing "at least 25" people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has described the area as under "siege" and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City killed five people, with others still missing, the civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A number of civilians are still under the rubble," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it was "looking into the reports" of the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry, meanwhile, said an Israeli strike on the village of Almat north of Beirut killed at least 20 people including three children on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north toward Lebanon, escalating air strikes and sending in ground troops, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah. The Lebanese group said it was acting in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's main military backer the United States on October 15 warned that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless Israel improves aid delivery to the Gaza Strip within 30 days – a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the time that top US officials made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today."
  <br>
  <br>
  The demand came before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a UN-backed assessment warned famine is imminent in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter Gaza were now lower than at any time since October 2023, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military questioned the report's credibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, all assessments by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground," a military statement said, denouncing "partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  IPC says its process is "evidence-based" and ensures "a rigorous, neutral analysis."
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of UN agencies in early November described north Gaza as "under siege" and denied "basic aid and life-saving supplies."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to use the remaining weeks of his term to press for an end to the Gaza and Lebanon wars, a spokesman said on Thursday, before fellow mediator Qatar on Saturday said it had suspended its role in trying to broker a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement. (AFP)

    King Charles leads silence for UK war dead

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.
 <br>
  <br>
  The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among the dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  William said this week that the past year had been "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, it's been dreadful," he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Speculators are betting on a Donald Trump presidency giving cryptocurrencies a boost. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778438_1_20241110213830.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as traders bet that Donald Trump's return to the White House will be good for the cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency passed US$80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12:00 pm (1200 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin reached US$75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of US$73,797 achieved in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first presidency, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency.

  Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.

  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a "historic transaction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin is listed continuously, including on Sundays. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Cavendish sprinted to one last victory on Sunday as he took the Singapore Criterium in a signature surge to the line.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I really wanted that so bad," the 39-year-old Briton said after his 166th career victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm terribly emotional. I realised in the last five laps that this was the last 15 kilometres of my career. I passed the flamme rouge for the last time in my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming out of the last bend, Cavendish, who holds the record for most stage wins in the Tour de France, briefly latched onto the wheel of defending champion Jasper Philipsen before pulling away. The Manxman had time to glance back before raising his arms in triumph one last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975, having matched the Belgian's mark in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was so on the limit. I didn't race since the Tour de France so I am missing sharpness," said Cavendish who returned to the saddle to finish third in the Saitama Criterium on November 2, clinched by Biniam Girmay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Criterium, organised by the Tour de France, covered 25 laps of a street circuit. Cavendish stayed in the peloton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was nervous about crashing, or something like that; not that there is anything wrong with that but I really wanted to finish," said Cavendish.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he intended to stay involved with cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love this sport. I've always loved it," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Tour de France isn't just a bike race it's the biggest annual sports event in the world, it's what children dream of. It's what adults dream of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling is such a form of freedom. It's a way to be however you want to be. It has so much potential as a sport, as a mode of transport, as a pastime. I will do anything I can to help this move forward." (AFP)

    Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of Toraji

<img alt="Severe Tropical Storm Toraji is set to batter parts of the Philippines still reeling from the devastation caused by three huge storms in less than a month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778429_1_20241110194929.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said on Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high," Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometres per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Edison Research projected on Saturday, completing a sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive Electoral College victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, who had secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House by early on Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris' 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Arizona, Trump won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states - and narrowly lost North Carolina, winning 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 74.6 million votes nationwide, or 50.5 percent, to Harris' 70.9 million, or 48 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on January 6, Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on January 20. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of US$10 billion in new deals at a business forum in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo told the China-Indonesia business forum that Jakarta wants to be part of Beijing's emergence as not only an economic but also a "civilisational power".
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration – not confrontation – is the way for peace and prosperity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the forum, Gao Yunlong, chairperson of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push for new achievements in bilateral trade and investment cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides should set an example of win-win cooperation among developing countries, Gao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Indonesia agreed to strengthen cooperation in key sectors, including lithium, new energy vehicles, green energy and tourism, according to a joint statement which was released after a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prabowo on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian leader on Sunday wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to the United States and then to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits. (Agencies)

    Make future shoebox homes bigger: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo calls on the government to add 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778412_1_20241110162312.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group has suggested that future housing units replacing subdivided homes should be larger than the minimum size proposed by the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his Policy Address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to eradicate substandard subdivided units and introduce “basic housing units”. The government said each unit must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sze Lai-shan, deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), said on Sunday officials should consider adding 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements, to ensure a suitable environment for families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one cares how many members are in 8 square metres, then it could be three or four people in 8 square metres. That would be too small and too inhumane for them," Sze said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With reference with the standard of public housing, if they are overcrowded, the living space for each person is 5.5 to 7 square metres, they would need to be rehoused to better places by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested the government put together a timetable for legislation, and that residents of cage homes and cubicle apartments could be covered as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while officials have made it clear that those affected by the phasing out of substandard subdivided units would be rehoused, some residents remained jittery.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tenant surnamed Wong, whose unit is regarded as substandard and will be regulated under the new legislation, said he is unsure what will happen next.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only hope for the government to be able to make plans on rehousing arrangements for us. I am happy as long as the rent is not higher than what I am paying now, which is HK$2,890," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cage home tenant, surnamed Fong, who lives in a flat that features 35 bedspaces, called on the government to build more public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am now paying a monthly rent of HK$2,700. The Policy Address did not mention cage homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government should speed up rehousing us, and build more public housing for us lower-class people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also said the government could provide rent or relocation subsidy for residents.
