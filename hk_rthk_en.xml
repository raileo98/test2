<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court on Thursday upheld the sedition convictions of former activist Tam Tak-chi over a string of incitement incidents in public in 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal also maintained the former vice chairman of People Power's jail sentence of three years and four months for sedition and public order-related offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam's lawyers argued that the case should have been tried by a High Court jury, not the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the prosecutors should be required to prove the appellant had the intention to incite others to engage in violence or create a public disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the top court judges dismissed both arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said it was valid for a magistrate to transfer the case to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges also ruled that clauses of the old sedition laws didn't require proof of the intention to incite as an element of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They noted the crimes listed all came with an "or" rather than an "and", dismissing the lawyers' reliance on a clause that states it is only an offence when a person counsels "disobedience to law or to any lawful order".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The clause] constitutes only one of the various alternative forms of seditious intention each of which is capable of constituting the offence," the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam was prosecuted and jailed under the decades-old sedition laws, before the enactment of the local national security legislation under Basic Law Article 23.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

    'More transparent private healthcare charges needed'

<img alt="The Consumer Council says many private hospitals and clinics did not provide sufficient price information, resulting in a flood of complaints. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794529_1_20250306130052.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's consumer watchdog on Thursday called on various private healthcare service providers, including hospitals and clinics, to be more transparent when they disclose their fees, given complaints over unexpectedly higher medical costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it received 191 complaints between 2021 and 2024, which were related to private medical care services, involving some HK$7.2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of those complaints were due to disputes over fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council blamed the disputes partially on the lack of sufficient disclosures of fees by those private health care premises, adding a council study found that nearly 70 percent of patients surveyed encountered "price variations" when examining their bills.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final costs, in some cases, were HK$60,000 to HK$70,000 higher compared with the initial budget estimation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But about 65 percent of respondents did not get any explanation regarding the price difference, and about 39 percent reported receiving only verbal budget estimates without any written or detailed breakdowns of the chargeable items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the council pointed out the dramatically varied prices among the private premises also made it difficult for people to compare medical costs for the same treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  To tackle the issue, the watchdog urged private medical providers to disclose their price list online, and roll out more packaged treatment services with clear and detailed written prices for consumers to choose and compare.

<img alt="UK police say Zou Zhenhao used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them. Photo: Metropolitan Police via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794530_1_20250306130805.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three people for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled the trio, who were members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, did not have a fair trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Implementation rules under the national security law require suspects deemed to be "foreign agents" to hand over information to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong were jailed in 2023 for four-and-a-half months each for refusing such a request about their former organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the top court found the evidence used by prosecutors to establish that the group was acting as a "foreign agent" was so heavily redacted that it was "self-defeating".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was self-defeating to have redacted out the only material relied on for establishing the foreign agent element of the offence, so that, in its absence, the charge could not be proved," the judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[D]epriving the appellants of all knowledge of the nature of the prosecution’s case... made it impossible for them to have a fair trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court therefore quashed the three's convictions and jail sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate security trial of inciting subversion involving Chow and two former Alliance leaders is still pending.

    Rare cyclone approaches Australian coast

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Early wind and rain from a rare tropical cyclone began lashing part of eastern Australia on Thursday as schools were closed, public transport was stopped and desperate residents got around shortages of sandbags by buying potting mix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred is forecast to cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early on Saturday, Bureau of Meteorology manager Matt Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The wind impacts, we’re already seeing those start to develop on the exposed locations along our coast with gusts reaching 80-90 kph. We are expecting those to continue to develop,” Collopy told reporters in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclones are common in Queensland’s tropical north but are rare in the state’s temperate and densely-populated southeast corner that borders New South Wales state. More than four million people lie in the cyclone’s path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfred was 280 kilometres east of Brisbane and moving west on Thursday with sustained winds near the centre of 95 kilometres per hour, and gusting to 130 kilometres per hour, Collopy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is expected to maintain its wind strength before hitting land.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the greatest fears are for the expected flooding over a wide area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modelling shows that up to 20,000 homes in Brisbane, a city largely built on a river floodplain, could experience some level of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said 660 schools in southern Queensland and 280 schools in northern New South Wales were closed on Thursday as weather conditions worsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federal government had delivered 310,000 sandbags to Brisbane and more were on the way, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shortage of sandbags in Brisbane, a city of more than three million people, led some to buy sacks of potting mix as an alternative, according to Damien Effeney, a chief executive of a rural supplies business. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers punched their ticket to the NBA playoffs with a hard-fought 112-107 victory over the Miami Heat.
 <br>
  <br>
  A see-saw battle in Cleveland saw the Heat threaten to end the Cavs' 11-game unbeaten streak after opening up a seven-point lead late in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Cavs clawed back the deficit in the closing minutes to seal their 12th straight victory and a place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers improved to 52-10, maintaining their stranglehold on the Eastern Conference with 20 games of the regular season remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell was one of six Cleveland players to finish in double figures against a short-handed Miami team missing Andrew Wiggins, Kel'el Ware and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley backed Mitchell with 16 points and 13 rebounds while Darius Garland finished with 15 points and 10 assists. Bam Adebayo led Miami's scorers with a game-high 34 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory though was too close for comfort for Cleveland talisman Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It took a collective effort as a group but we locked down and got stops – but we've got to be better," Mitchell said. "It's always good to learn through a win though."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell played down the significance of Cleveland becoming the first team to reach the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a blessing and a sign of our hard work, but it don't really mean much," Mitchell said. "I'm happy we were able to do it for the crowd, but we've got a lot more to accomplish."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's nearest pursuers, the Boston Celtics, powered past the Portland Trail Blazers 128-118 after a sensational pair of 40-point performances from Derrick White and Payton Pritchard.
  <br>
  <br>
  White finished with 41 points while Pritchard erupted for 43 points, delivering a shooting masterclass that included 10 three-pointers from 16 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were tremendous," Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said of White and Pritchard's double-act. "The way those two played says a lot about who they are.

  "They do a lot of the dirty work. So to have a night like this where those two can show what they're capable of was good for us," he added. "We're lucky to have them and it's a lot of fun to watch them do that."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the people's government of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Thursday said classes have resumed in Dingri County following the massive earthquake earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a plenary meeting of Tibet deputies of the National People Congress in Beijing, Gama Cedain expressed gratitude to various provinces and sectors of society that provided support after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck the county in Xigaze city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his work report, Premier Li Qiang said Beijing would provide "quality meteorological services" to better respond to natural disasters including floods and earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will provide support for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction efforts in Dingri County, Xizang Autonomous Region, and work to ensure that residential buildings and infrastructure in key areas are more earthquake-resistant," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gama Cedain said reconstruction work began on Monday, adding the work report's mention of these efforts showed the advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman also highlighted Tibet's current economic and cultural prosperity, noting the region has experienced no major political or violent cases for 17 consecutive years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Air Force on Thursday said one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilians being injured.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Eight MK-82 general-purpose bombs were abnormally released from an Air Force KF-16 aircraft, landing outside the designated firing range," the Air Force said, adding it deeply regretted the incident "which resulted in civilian casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  An official at Gyeonggi-do Bukbu Fire Services said out of the eight people who had been wounded, four were seriously hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pocheon is about 40 kilometres northeast of Seoul and near the heavily militarised border with North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials suspected the munitions dropped on the town was from ongoing live-fire joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photographs shared by news agency News1 that it said were from the scene showed a badly damaged house with rubble strewn on the ground next to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said earlier on Thursday that South Korea and US forces were holding their first joint live-fire exercises in Pocheon which were linked to annual military drills due to start next week. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong stocks rose on Thursday following a jump on Wall Street, after the Trump administration delayed auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rose 392 points, or 1.67 percent, to open at 23,987 points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain strongly condemned on Wednesday the sentencing of UK national James Anderson to 19 years in prison by a Russian court, which accused him of having fought for the Ukrainian army.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the sentencing of James Anderson, a British national, in a Russian court on false charges," said a spokesperson for the Foreign Office, who called on Russia to respect its obligations towards "prisoners of war".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian court press service for the city of Kursk said James Scott Rhys Anderson, 22, was found guilty of a "terrorist act" and acting as a mercenary, after he was captured while fighting in the region in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kursk court released video of Anderson being led into court in handcuffs, wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nodded silently after having the sentence translated to him. He has the option to file an appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine launched its shock cross-border offensive in August, the first time a foreign army took control of Russian territory since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson, from the English town of Banbury, has spoken in several videos filmed by Russian officials after he was taken prisoner, saying that he went to fight for Ukraine's International Legion after being sacked from the British army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kursk's second western district military court spent three days on Anderson's trial with the hearings held behind closed doors, the press service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said Anderson admitted guilt and decided to take part in the "armed conflict for financial reward".
  <br>
  <br>
  Anderson earlier told Russia's Izvestia newspaper he was paid US$400 a-month and about US$60 a day while on combat missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton was told by the court he would spend the first five years of his sentence in a prison - where conditions are worse than in a penal colony. He would then be transferred to a penal colony with "strict" conditions. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang’s work report has offered “important guidance” on implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, as he pledged to further align Hong Kong with national development strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, the premier said Beijing will continue to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also mentioned the central government’s backing to the two SARs on growing their economies, improving people’s livelihoods and deepening international exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  On social media, the chief executive said the government work report not only set out the country’s economic targets and policies, but also gave important direction for the practice of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the premier’s message, Lee said his administration is heading in the right direction with its policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By following this correct policy direction and proactively aligning with the nation’s development strategies, Hong Kong’s development will have a bright future,” he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must better leverage the advantages of the One Country, Two Systems principle and break new ground.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will further deepen international exchanges and strengthen its role as a connector, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On top of consolidating trade ties with traditional markets such as Europe and the United States, we will also work hard to explore new markets including the Middle East, Asean countries and Central Asia, while actively striving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,” he wrote.

<img alt="Demonstrators in Jerusalem call for the immediate return of hostages held in Gaza. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794490_1_20250306090342.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a “last warning” to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply-worded message after the White House confirmed he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump said. “Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hawkish language came after the United States confirmed the unprecedented direct talks with Hamas, with the US envoy on hostage affairs, Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trump’s first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages - including Edan Alexander, an American citizen - as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of a ceasefire ended over the weekend after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel has ramped up pressure, not just with threats, by halting all entry of goods and supplies into Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain and Germany jointly on Wednesday called the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic," and urged Israel to ensure the "unhindered" delivery of aid. (Agencies)

    Wall Street rebounds after Trump pauses auto tariffs

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US President decided to "give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA", a North American free trade pact. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794487_1_20250306084640.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

 Israel's new military chief Eyal Zamir said his country's mission to defeat Hamas remained unfinished as he took office on Wednesday, with uncertainty hanging over the fragile Gaza ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before Zamir at a ceremony at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was "determined" to achieve victory in the multi-front war that began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack.
  <br>

  His remarks came after Arab leaders endorsed a plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), presenting an alternative to US President Donald Trump's widely-condemned proposal to take over the territory and displace its people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the prospect of the PA governing Gaza remains far from certain, with Israel having ruled out any future role for the body in the territory ruled by Hamas since 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has indeed suffered a severe blow, but it has not yet been defeated. The mission is not yet accomplished," Zamir said, amid a deadlock in negotiations on the next steps in the ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zamir is replacing Herzi Halevi, who announced his resignation as armed forces chief in January over the military's shortcomings on October 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has since released the findings of an internal investigation that acknowledged its "complete failure" to prevent the deadliest attack on Israel since its creation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas assault resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, most of them civilians, while Israel's military retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,405 people, also mostly civilians, data from both sides show. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Thursday said the advent of artificial intelligence startups such as DeepSeek has been a boon to the nation’s technological development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Fellow at the Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen’s comment came after Beijing said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that AI startups have been “a revelation” for policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Quite frankly, these kind of breakthroughs – whether it's in film or with video games, and now artificial intelligence – this has really boosted the government’s confidence in its own sectors,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It also completely changed the regular citizen’s view and confidence in their abilities as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the government work report’s efforts to deepen cooperation with other countries, Tangen said the world is “positive” on the nation’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They’re just simply saying, we’ll continue to grow where we are welcome and continue to invest where we are welcome.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also noted the work report said that Hong Kong and Macau will continue to connect the nation with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of that has to do with trying to attract investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a prominent position in that and they’re trying to assure them that One Country, Two Systems will continue and that both of these entities are very valuable.”

    Greenlanders shrug off Trump's takeover bid

<img alt="Locals in the capital city of Nuuk are largely unfazed by President Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794464_1_20250306032159.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenlanders on Wednesday shrugged off US President Donald Trump's vow to take over the Arctic island, seeing it merely as an opportunity to advance their own independence bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the quiet hallways of the University of Greenland in Nuuk, the capital of the Danish autonomous territory, Trump's latest remarks that he would take over Greenland "one way or another" left locals largely unfazed, despite his more menacing tone this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it's just something ridiculous he would say, but I wouldn't take it seriously because he's basically all talk and no action," said 23-year-old law student Peter Malik Henningsen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That sounds very violent and it's also very dumb... because Denmark, and Greenland, is also an ally of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first major policy speech on Tuesday since returning to power, Trump underlined his expansionist vision, reiterating the importance of the United States taking over the strategically-located and mineral-rich Arctic island and taking back the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  About a quarter the size of the mainland US, Greenland's location in the Arctic puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than a week before general elections in Greenland where independence has dominated the campaign, Trump said he had a message for the island's 57,000-strong population, whom he described as "incredible people".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he then made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: "One way or the other we're going to get it," insisting the island was needed for reasons of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump offered to buy Greenland already during his first term as president - in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the Oval Office in January, he has put the topic back on the agenda, and has this time said he wouldn't rule out military force to get it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump is like that, a bit unpredictable at times but I'm not worried," said another law student, David Jensen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're part of Nato, the United States are part of Nato, so I'm not worried," insisted the 20-year-old who hails from one of the northernmost regions of Greenland. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool snatched a late winner to beat Paris Saint-Germain away 1-0 in the first leg of their heavyweight Champions League last-16 tie, as Barcelona claimed a 1-0 win at Benfica despite the Catalan giants playing most of the game with 10 men.
 <br>
  <br>
  French league leaders PSG dominated at the Parc des Princes but couldn't make their superiority count and Harvey Elliott struck three minutes from time after replacing Mohamed Salah with Liverpool's only shot on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half but Arne Slot's side defended resolutely to keep PSG at bay and are in a strong position to advance to the quarter-finals going into next week's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made several crucial saves, as PSG had 28 attempts on goal but could not replicate the finishing that had allowed them to score 21 goals in their last five Champions League outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably the performance of my life," Alisson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To go away with a win over here was probably a bit more than we deserved," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Liverpool finish the job at home next Tuesday, they could face Aston Villa in the quarter-finals, but PSG coach Luis Enrique said his side will have "nothing to lose".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to win clearly, we created a lot of chances," said the Spaniard. "Football is unfair many times and you have to accept that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Raphinha drilled home after 61 minutes to give five-time winners Barcelona a slim advantage over Benfica despite playing most of the game with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage defender Pau Cubarsi was sent off midway through the first half of the tight clash in Lisbon with the score goalless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona have not won the competition since 2015 but are expected to go deep this season, after a draw which many consider favourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick insisted before the game there was no such thing as an "easy" tie and the coach was proven right on a tense evening in the Portuguese capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said to the team that I'm very proud," said the German coach after his team emerged with a victory. "After the 22nd minute with 10 players it was not easy, and this is a big win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny endured two high-profile mistakes against Benfica in the group stage in January, but made amends with a string of saves as Barca were pinned back in the final half hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szczesny made a smart save to deny Benfica's Kerem Akturkoglu after just a few seconds, and the opening stages were played in a way that indicated both sides were picking up where they left off in Barcelona's wild 5-4 win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dani Olmo fired narrowly wide at the other end as Barca threatened, before Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin produced a stunning triple save to keep the score level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian first parried Dani Olmo's prodded effort, then made a brilliant reaction stop to thwart Robert Lewandowski converting from point-blank range and mopped up Lamine Yamal's attempt from the rebound. (AFP)

<img alt="New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra, left, celebrates with teammate Kane Williamson after scoring a century. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794471_1_20250306053652.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson struck hundreds as New Zealand eased to a 50-run win over South Africa in Lahore to set up a rematch with India in the Champions Trophy final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra made 108 off 101 balls and Williamson hit 102 off 94 deliveries, as New Zealand posted a Champions Trophy record 362-6 before restricting South Africa to 312-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Miller finished unbeaten on 100 but his 67-ball blitz came in vain with the game already well out of reach, as South Africa suffered their fifth Champions Trophy semi-final defeat after those in 2000, 2002, 2006 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won the first edition of the tournament in Bangladesh in 1998, when it was named the ICC KnockOut Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner excelled with the ball and took 3-43 with his left-arm spin, breaking a 105-run partnership for South Africa's second wicket by removing rival skipper Temba Bavuma for 56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma started slowly but steadied the innings with Rassie van der Dussen, who scored a fluent 69 before being deceived by a beautiful delivery from Santner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santner then dealt a critical blow when he dismissed Heinrich Klaasen for three, caught by a diving Matt Henry at long-on, dashing South Africa's hopes of pulling off the highest chase in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra had Aiden Markram caught and bowled for 31 while Glenn Phillips chipped in with 2-27 as South Africa crumbled against spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a cool feeling to make the final," said Santner. "We were challenged by a good side and now we've had a go against India, look forward to do it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand last won an ICC ODI men's event in 2000, beating India in the final of that year's Champions Trophy in Kenya. India won by 44 runs when the teams met in the group phase last Sunday in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma said New Zealand were simply too good for South Africa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Zealand were above par," said Bavuma. "We backed ourselves to chase 350 with the wicket getting better but they really put us under pressure from the get-go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra and Williamson set the foundations for a big total on a batting-friendly Gaddafi Stadium pitch after New Zealand won the toss and batted first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daryl Mitchell clubbed 49 off 37 balls and Phillips smashed a 27-ball 49 not out as the Black Caps plundered 110 runs in the last 10 overs and 66 in the last five.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa's bowling line-up struggled right from the start as Ravindra and Will Young (21) put on 48 for the opening stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was followed by a magnificent 164-run partnership for the second wicket between Ravindra and Williamson that put the New Zealanders on track for a massive total, as the duo scored at will with some delightful strokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra completed his fifth ODI hundred – all coming in ICC events – from 93 balls with a two off Kagiso Rabada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson reached his 15th ODI hundred with a ramped boundary, his third three-figure score in as many matches against South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Rabada who finally ended the partnership by dismissing Ravindra caught behind. Ravindra hit 13 fours and one six in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson chipped Wiaan Mulder into the hands of Lungi Ngidi in the 40th over after hitting 10 fours and two sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell and Phillips added some late impetus after South Africa had briefly dragged things back to give themselves hope of limiting the score to under 350.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fast bowler Ngidi finished with 3-72, while Rabada ended with figures of 2-70. (AFP)

    US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine

<img alt="The Central Intelligence Agency director John Ratcliffe describes the pause as temporary. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794449_1_20250305221949.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has "paused" intelligence sharing with Ukraine after a dramatic breakdown in relations between Kyiv and the White House, CIA director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a public falling-out in the Oval Office last week, followed by Ukraine's top ally suspending crucial US military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed that intelligence sharing had also been frozen as Ukraine seeks to beat back the Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process," Ratcliffe told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe said the pause "on the military front and the intelligence front" was temporary, and the United States will again "work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Tuesday that Zelensky told him Kyiv was ready for talks with Moscow and the finalisation of a US minerals deal, as Ukraine works to move on after the Oval Office spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has sought to bring Trump back onside, posting on social media that their clash was "regrettable" and he wanted "to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his address to the US Congress later on Tuesday, Trump read aloud from a letter from Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The letter reads, 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,'" Trump told US lawmakers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau have the full backing of the central government in integrating into the country’s development, a senior Beijing official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, met Chief Executive John Lee, who attended the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, Xia praised the SAR administration’s performance in recognising and responding to changes, fully promoting high-quality development, and uniting the entire society to focus on the city’s economy and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The central government has always adhered to the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, and fully backed the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into the overall development of the country,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia was also quoted as saying that he hopes Hong Kong would work to consolidate the city’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to become a place for high-performing individuals to gather.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a government statement, the Chief Executive vowed to lead all sectors of the SAR to proactively integrate into national development, and contribute to the Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the head of Beijing’s liaison office in the SAR urged local NPC deputies to “shoulder the historic mission and responsibility of promoting Hong Kong’s transition from stability to prosperity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting, liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong pointed out that the delegates should take up four roles to further bolster the territory’s development – athletes, active players, doers, and leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also highlighted the importance of tapping into the city’s advantages, introducing reforms, supporting the country’s high-quality development, connecting with the mainland and the world, as well as preventing risks.

  “Zheng emphasised that over the past few years, Hong Kong has made a number of major accomplishments, and has been widely recognised by the international community,” his office's statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is a key year for Hong Kong to accelerate its transition from stability to prosperity.”

 Resembling a squat, wide fridge, the world's most accurate clock went on sale for US$3.3 million in Japan on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Aether clock OC 020" is so precise that it would take 10 billion years for it to deviate by one second, according to its Kyoto-based manufacturer Shimadzu Corporation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as a "strontium optical lattice clock", it is 100 times more accurate than caesium atomic clocks, the current standard for defining seconds, the precision-equipment producer said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The machine, a box around a metre tall, is small for its kind with a volume of around 250 litres. It can also be used in research fieldwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shimadzu is aiming to sell 10 of its clocks over the next three years and hopes its customers will use them to advance scientific research in areas such as the observation of tectonic activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Optical lattice clocks have previously been installed in Tokyo's famous Skytree, the world's tallest tower, to test the general theory of relativity, which states that "time flows more slowly in places with strong gravity." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A vibrant festival celebrating Indian culture through dance, music and cuisine, is set to brighten up the streets of Lan Kwai Fong later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaugural "Incredible India Festival", organised by the Consulate General of India in Hong Kong and the Lan Kwai Fong Association, will take place on March 15 and 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that this will bring Indian art and culture to an accessible space for all Hongkongers, as well as tourists and foster an appreciation and better understanding of India's rich cultural heritage that goes back millenia, making it truly 'Incredible India'," said Satwant Khanalia, the consul general of India in Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Zeman, CEO of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, said he’s looking forward to creating a fully immersive experience for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the streets will be filled with "lots of great food, music performances, dance performances, and different workshops".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a really rich history of Indian community going back at least 150 to 200 years almost, and that community still exists here, and it's important to build a bridge with the existing Indian culture over in India. It brings a lot of new elements to Hong Kong and a lot of richness to the mosaic that we have here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day festival will be open to the public for free, and Zeman said he expects around 15,000 people to turn up.

    Air passenger departure tax to go up from Oct 1

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Travellers purchasing a plane ticket to fly out of Hong Kong from October 1 will have to pay HK$200 in air passenger departure tax (APDT) instead of the current HK$120, the government announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tax increase was announced by Financial Secretary Paul Chan when he delivered his budget blueprint last month. The measure is expected to boost government revenue by about HK$1.6 billion each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, officials say some passengers will continue to be exempted from the tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include passengers under the age of 12, direct transit passengers, those taking connecting flights, as well as passengers who arrive at and depart Hong Kong by plane on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who get to the Hong Kong International Airport by ship, or by vehicle via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, will also be waived, provided that they remain in the restricted area at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The APDT was last increased more than 20 years ago in 2003-04. The proposed increase constitutes only a very small portion of the overall travelling cost for the general public and travellers to Hong Kong. The impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal,” a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Air Passenger Departure Tax (Amendment) Bill will be gazetted on Friday, and it will be tabled at the Legislative Council for first reading and the commencement of the second reading debate on March 19.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James became the first player in NBA history to score 50,000 career points on Tuesday, extending his lead as the league's all-time record scorer by reaching a milestone tally that may never be surpassed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers superstar went into the game against the New Orleans Pelicans with 49,999 regular and postseason points after a 17-point performance in Sunday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not take long for the 40-year-old NBA icon to get the solitary point needed to reach the 50,000-point barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who is in dazzling form in the 22nd season of a glittering career, gathered a pass from Luka Doncic and unfurled a sublime 25-foot three-pointer to move to 50,002 points with the Crypto.com Arena crowd roaring their acclaim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James had passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's previous all-time regular-season scoring record of 38,387 points in 2023 – itself a record that had stood for 39 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  James is now nearly 6,000 points clear of Abdul-Jabbar's total career points tally of 44,149, with Karl Malone third (41,689 points) and the late Kobe Bryant fourth with 39,283 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Jordan is fifth on the all-time scoring list with 38,279.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among active NBA players, only Kevin Durant, with just over 35,000 points – roughly 15,000 points behind James – makes the top 10. (AFP)

    'Mild inflation target still a concern'

<img alt="China has lowered its inflation target for the year from 3% to 2%. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794419_1_20250305181546.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists have struck a cautious note on China's plan to lower the nation's inflation target from three to two percent in the coming year, citing prolonged deflationary pressure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as Premier Li Qiang delivered his annual work report to the National People's Congress, setting out economic priorities for 2025, including a growth target of around five percent for the third year in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist at ANZ Bank, said while he believes the five percent growth target is achievable, partly due to improved sentiment on the economy following recent technological breakthroughs, questions loom over the nation's persistently low consumer price growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously this number [two percent] is still way above the current inflation number, which was around 0.5 percent in January. But China is still under a strong deflationary pressure as the consumer price index has been inactive for almost 2.5 years," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The question is how the government can inflate the economy. Are they going to print more money? Are they going to have a fiscal policy intensity strong enough to push the domestic demand so to restore the economy back to inflation? There are still some open questions for us to ask."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Hong Kong-based economist said the target suggests the authorities are dedicated to offering support to the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yeung, Tian Xuan, associate dean at Tsinghua University's school of finance, said in a group interview in Beijing that boosting public consumption is a vital growth engine for the economy this year, adding that policymakers have adopted a more proactive monetary policy with expanded fiscal support to shore up demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fiscal deficit target this year, the Beijing-based economist noted, was raised to four percent from three percent last year, marking the highest level in three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will issue a total of 1.3 trillion yuan (US$182 billion) worth of ultra-long special treasury bonds this year to spur growth, including 300 billion yuan on bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes, Tian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the measures are a good signal, but warned the issue is whether local governments will properly implement the fiscal supports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problems in the past few years were that the local government or state-owned companies, they are not really executing what the central government ask them to do. So there's a lot of hoarding of 'firepower' that has not been translated into economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the focus is not just whether the target is four percent, it is about whether they are willing to execute at the local level, to execute those funds."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yeung shrugged off concerns over the extra US tariffs on Chinese goods, noting that Chinese exports to the US steadily declined in recent years and now only account for about 13 percent of China's total exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our estimation is that every 10 percent increase in tariff rates will only drag down export growth by 0.5 percent of the GDP across several years, which means that every year the impact would be very, very minimal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem of the Chinese economy is always domestic, and how to revive the domestic confidence, how to stabilise the property market, so that China is not going to go through the asset price deflation. That is more important than the US tariffs," Yeung added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Andy Tsang on Wednesday slammed the US move to slap additional tariffs on Chinese exports because of the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsang, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission and a former Hong Kong police commissioner, made the comments in Beijing on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on China, citing a lack of progress on tackling fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said Beijing will study countermeasures and the move should not affect anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he believes China is one of the world's best performers in drug-control efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former health minister and CPPCC delegate Ko Wing-man, meanwhile, said the setting up of Hong Kong's third medical school aims to strengthen medical education and research capabilities, not just addressing doctor shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another CPPCC member and former Bar Association chairwoman Winnie Tam said she hopes the Greater Bay Area will recognise Hong Kong's potential to help train professionals in foreign-related legal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who chairs the Communications Authority, also said her team will continue to improve anti-fraud measures and work more closely with different platforms.

 Hong Kong and Macau will always have the central government's backing in terms of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, a senior official in charge of the SARs' affairs pledged on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by RTHK if more support measures were in store for Hong Kong, Wang pointed to the city's booming stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if investors were confident about Hong Kong, then the stock market would do well.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, Hongkongers were told by a former Beijing official to cherish their city and build it into a better place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan Tieniu, who was deputy director of Beijing's liaison office between 2016 and 2022, said Hong Kong had special meaning for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city is a "very good" place and has a key role to play in the country's overall development, and urged everyone to "steadfastly and successfully" implement "One Country, Two Systems".

 Andy Kwok, the captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, on Wednesday said he expects a lot more spectators at the second edition of LIV Golf Hong Kong event in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will be the third event of the League's 2025 season, taking place from March 7 to 9 at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he is looking forward to seeing people from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that we're now bringing mega sporting event organisers coming to Hong Kong to host mega sports events. I think it's great for Hong Kong, great for our people, great for the economy and as the club, being a golf club, obviously we want to bring the best golf events of the world to Hong Kong," he said.

  "We were quite successful in hosting the first edition of the LIV Golf Hong Kong last year, and we're looking forward to an even more successful LIV Golf Hong Kong event this year, and hopefully we will try our best to continue to bring world-class events, and hopefully LIV can come back continuously in the future. We will try very hard to facilitate that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott O'Neil, CEO of LIV Golf, said the tour plans to have a major presence in all the markets that matter in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of Asia, it's no secret golf is booming here. I believe we're up about 30 percent year over year in terms of participants playing golf, and it's no surprise that this is a place where we feel like home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll obviously be in Hong Kong and Singapore and Korea, and those are three markets that we're very passionate about."

 The head of China's market regulator has pledged to tighten oversight of the rapidly growing e-commerce sector, and promote the healthy development of the so-called platform economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luo Wen, director of State Administration for Market Regulation, made the comments on Wednesday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, after attending the opening session of the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to malpractice by some live-streaming hosts who offer products which are either counterfeit or poor in quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will fulfil its supervision role, Luo said, by strengthening product inspections and toughening enforcement against misleading advertisements and promotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On platform fees, he said the aim is to establish a reasonable and transparent charging mechanism to lessen the burden of small and medium-sized merchants.
  <br>
  <br>
  E-commerce platforms will be instructed to simplify and publish their rates, while authorities will publish guidelines to help them achieve this goal, Luo added.

    Hospital patient chokes to death after meal blunder

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Caritas Medical Centre on Wednesday said it is investigating what led to an elderly patient choking to death after he was given a regular meal despite not being able to eat solid food.
 <br>
  <br>
  The man, 75, who had a history of cognitive impairment and high blood pressure, was admitted at the end of last month suffering from abdominal bloating and constipation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was taken off food and given intravenous fluids instead, but after his condition improved doctors decided he could go back to his usual diet of pureed food, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By March 3, his condition continued to improve, and the medical team determined that this patient could return to eating his usual food, so it was recorded in his medical records as 'DAT', which stands for 'diet as tolerated'," the hospital's chief executive, Gladys Kwan, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the nurse and doctor responsible had a communication issue, as the nurse mistakenly thought the instruction meant he could have a normal meal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said a student nurse was instructed to feed and monitor the man after each bite. Although the patient initially managed to swallow and chew, he soon began to cough, prompting the student to alert the medical team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was declared dead after resuscitation efforts, the hospital said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has apologised to the man's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Cheung, chief manager for patient safety and risk management at the Hospital Authority, said a committee has been established to investigate the incident and to implement improvement measures within eight weeks.

    'Govt will support NGOs amid funding cuts'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said the government would help NGOs save costs by streamlining administrative procedures amid funding cuts due to the fiscal deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government would help shoulder a four percent reduction for 121 small-and-medium sized NGOs, meaning they would only face a three percent funding cut by the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, for the 58 large NGOs receiving over HK$50 million in government funding annually, Sun said they would have to bear the seven percent cuts on their own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Wednesday, Sun said the government would give larger NGOs more time to hold onto their financial reserves, so they could make better use of their resources through these “difficult years”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would give these NGOs more flexibility, and help them save costs by streamlining procedures such as reporting on how they used their funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm pretty confident after the meeting on Monday that we are more or less on the same page, so we are working together while we're facing a budget cut," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time, because of the more flexible use of reserves and also the efforts we are making to provide more room for them to make better use of their resources, we should be able to deal with it together,” he added.

    Rain offers hope in Japan's worst wildfire in 50 years

<img alt="The wildfire broke out on February 26, and firefighting efforts including Japan Self-Defense Forces, have continued while thousands have evacuated their homes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wet weather looked poised to offer relief Wednesday as Japan battled its worst wildfire in half a century in a northern region hit by record-low rainfall.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze around the northern city of Ofunato has killed one person and forced nearly 4,000 to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has engulfed around 2,900 hectares -- over eight times the area of New York City's Central Park -- making it Japan's largest wildfire since at least 1975, when 2,700 hectares burnt in Kushiro on Hokkaido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain and snow were falling Wednesday as several columns of white smoke billowed from a mountain where the blaze has been raging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Firefighters have been working on the ground through the night to extinguish the fire," a city official said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are hoping that snow, which started to fall this morning, will help," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 84 buildings are believed to have been damaged, although details are still being assessed, according to the fire agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of late Tuesday, almost 4,000 people living nearby had complied with orders to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan endured its hottest summer on record last year, as climate change pushes up temperatures worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of wildfires in the country has declined since its 1970s peak, but there were about 1,300 in 2023, concentrated in the period from February to April when the air dries out and winds pick up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese baseball prodigy Roki Sasaki, who recently joined the Los Angeles Dodgers, has offered a 10-million-yen (US$67,000) donation and 500 sets of bedding to people affected by the wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki was a high school student there, after losing his father and grandparents in the huge 2011 tsunami. (AFP)

 Fans at Kai Tak for the World Snooker Grand Prix will now be allowed to stay until the last game is finished, the government says, after spectators were ejected from the venue while a match was still underway on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 100 people were watching Kyren Wilson play Matthew Selt in Kai Tak Arena when at around 11.15pm, with the match going into the fifth frame, the crowd were told to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Secretary Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that organisers were worried about the availability of public transport if the spectators stayed any longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This situation is obviously not ideal, and we definitely need to take into account the experience seriously and identify remedial measures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law described the saga as "teething problems" and said it won't happen again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting from tonight, all spectators will be allowed to view the entire series of matches until the last game is done. So, there will be no more question of spectators having to leave before the game ends," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said those affected can get complimentary tickets for another session of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some spectators were required to leave early before the match concluded and were unable to watch the full game. The tournament organising committee sincerely apologises for this situation," a statement said.

    Democrat lawmaker ejected during Trump's speech

<div class="itemFullText">
 Democrats protested President Donald Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday with signs reading "No King!" and "Save Medicaid," with some turning their backs on the Republican as he spoke and one lawmaker marched out by security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Representative Al Green of Texas, a Democrat who plans to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump, loudly interrupted the speech in its first minutes by shouting that Trump did not have a mandate to cut safety net programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans are trying to pass a spending bill that could significantly slash spending on popular social programs, including the Medicaid health insurance plan for low-income people, to pay for Trump's desired tax cut plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Green from the chamber, and Republicans cheered as Green relented - waving his cane in the air - and was led out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green told reporters afterward, "It's worth it to let people know that there are some of us who are going to stand up against this president's desire to cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Republicans holding majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, any impeachment effort against Trump is unlikely to advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a third of the Democrats' side of the chamber had emptied as Trump's address crossed the threshold to become the longest such speech on record at an hour and 30 minutes. The rest quickly departed as Republicans gave Trump a standing ovation when the speech ended after 100 minutes, the longest in Congressional history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have given their backing to the country's economic growth target of around five percent target this year, saying it was no easy feat but achievable.
 <br>
  <br>
  HSBC chairman Peter Wong, who's a CPPCC delegate, was fully confident the country could meet the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recalled the many economic stimulus measures rolled out by the central government last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that hitting the five percent growth target last year was no easy feat, given the geopolitical situation and the world economy. But we worked hard to achieve this goal, and it wasn't easy," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 2025, I feel the country is well-planned to meet its goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's sentiment was shared by Jonathan Choi, who chairs the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman, who is also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, noted Beijing's support measures benefit companies big and small, across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just feel that we can achieve it, because at the moment, the Chinese government spent a lot of attention [on] local enterprises, not only the [state-owned enterprises] ... AI and also technology, new (sectors are) coming up," he commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NPC deputy Nicholas Chan described the five percent growth target as a bold one, considering the scale of China's economy - the second-largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a big economy, five percent in GDP is huge. Five percent is basically the entire economy of Switzerland. With such a big pie, just a small growth is humongous," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this will lead to a lot of opportunities for people all over the world, for people along the Belt and Road, Brics (countries), and Rcep (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), so lots of opportunities for our friends together."

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese companies are doubling down on innovation as part of efforts to contribute to the national drive of developing "new quality productive forces", with leaders convening in Beijing for the annual Two Sessions meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Lei Jun, the chairman of Xiaomi, which was originally a smartphone maker but has entered the electric vehicle (EV) space, said technological innovation aided his firm's meteoric rise in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investment in technological innovation reached 105 billion yuan over the past five years, which helped Xiaomi to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, selling some 170 million mobile phones last year, Lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of its internet-based smart home devices, meanwhile, also fared well, with some 900 million such items being sold, demonstrating the popularity of Chinese tech products around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lei, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said Xiaomi would continue to invest in technological research and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manufacturing is the foundation of China and the foundation of a strong country. Xiaomi, as a builder and beneficiary of the manufacturing industry, will continue to adhere to the path of striving for scientific and technological innovation as well as high-end development, ramp up the cultivation of new quality productive forces, apply the latest artificial intelligence technology to all our terminals, to let all consumers experience the wonderful life brought by technologies, and at the same time, contribute our efforts to the development of the Chinese-style modernisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence in the country's private sector, after attending a high-profile meeting with President Xi Jinping last month which indicated stronger support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lei, Zhou Yunjie, chairman of Chinese home appliances firm Haier, who is also an NPC deputy, said that technology helped boost the company's global ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scientific and technological innovation is a key factor for a brand whether it could stand strong in the world. If an enterprise aims to go global, it has to stick to technological innovation as its solid base, to keep on innovating - until it reaches the top, so that the brand could truly be a top leader. Haier has also been adhering to such a principle, we kept looking up to international standards until we reached breakthroughs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou added that artificial intelligence was a new opportunity for China and that more Chinese firms would be able to create internationally recognised brands.

<img alt="A government work report says GDP growth is tipped to reach five percent in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794337_1_20250305115951.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts on Wednesday said China's economic goals announced at the opening session of this year's National People's Congress are reasonable and attainable.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang said GDP growth is tipped to reach five percent in 2025. It also said more than 12 million new urban jobs will be created and that authorities are aiming for a two percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witman Hung, the Director of the Greater Bay Area Research Center of the China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, said the economic growth target is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should never underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to meet those targets, I mean if you look at the past, they’re pretty good at forecasting and then meeting the target,” Hung told RTHK’s Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Five percent [GDP growth] is a reasonable estimate. The inflation side, two percent is a good one, it can be anywhere up and down a little bit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen, said China had the capacity to deliver on its jobs creation pledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to remember that China is not like the US or Europe – they’re not guessing what it can be – if they want to create 12 million jobs, they can simply take all the jobs that are being created by the private sector and then add additional jobs directly through the government or through state-owned enterprises, etcetera,” Tangen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And in terms of growth rate, I think it’s reasonable. As I said, people have to remember China is not like the rest of the world – they have the tools to do that. It also comes down to cost or how much debt they’re going to pile on, and things like this,” he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said the nation will vigorously boost consumption and investment, with domestic demand becoming "the main engine and anchor of economic growth" as stated in his government work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures outlined is the issuance of 300 billion yuan of ultra-long treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said Beijing will adopt special measures to boost spending power, increase the supply of quality products and services, and improve the consumption environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will create a full range of new consumption scenarios to advance the growth of digital, green, smart, and other types of consumption. We will also introduce measures to unleash the consumption potential in culture and sports-related industries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said Beijing will expand effective investment and create greater synergy between fiscal and financial policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will implement new mechanisms for public-private partnership in a well-regulated manner and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects, thus creating more opportunities for the development of private capital," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that 735 billion yuan will be earmarked in the central government's budget for investment this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, observers believe government policies will not only lead to sustained growth this year but also lay the groundwork for the modernisation drive in the long run, as the country embarks on its next Five-Year Plan from 2026.

<img alt="US President Donald Trump hailed his first few weeks in office, telling Congress his administration had accomplished great things for America. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794327_1_20250305104833.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump took a victory lap in a speech to Congress on Tuesday, exulting in a series of dramatic actions that have upended American foreign policy, ignited a trade war with close allies and slashed the federal workforce since he took office six weeks ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To my fellow citizens, America is back," Trump began to a standing ovation from fellow Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started," Trump said to frequent chants from loyal lawmakers of "USA, USA!"
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American Dream is surging -- bigger and better than ever before. The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again."
  <br>
  <br>
  The primetime speech, his first to Congress since taking office on January 20, capped a second day of market turmoil after he imposed sweeping new tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump spoke in the House of Representatives, where lawmakers huddled in fear for their lives a little over four years ago while a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory over the then-incumbent Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president called his first few weeks in office "the most successful" first month of any US presidency in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also defended his tariff campaign, despite concerns that it could raise consumer prices and slow economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market."
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders were watching Trump's speech closely, a day after he paused all military aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension followed an Oval Office blowup in which Trump angrily upbraided Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of TV cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in aid threatened Kyiv's efforts to defend against Russia, and further rattled European leaders worried that Trump is moving the US too far toward Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of the country's closest allies, and an additional 10 percent on Chinese imports deepened investor concerns about the economy.

 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.

  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the National People's Congress opening said the country will pursue integrated advancements in technological and industrial innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries of the future and foster industries such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said authorities will unleash the digital economy under its AI Plus initiative, which will work to combine digital technologies with China’s manufacturing and market strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation, intelligent, large-scale AI models”, and development of next-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing terminals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time AI models were mentioned in the work report, which comes after the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will strive to create an enabling environment for innovation that encourages exploration and tolerates failure," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the development of new quality productive forces, with the aim to foster emerging and future industries, such as quantum technology and the low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the report laid out ways the country would deepen multilateral and regional economic cooperation, saying Beijing will continue to expand the nation’s globally-oriented network of free trade areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will resolutely safeguard the WTO-centred multilateral trading system, broaden converging interests with other countries and promote shared development,” it said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks rose 1.13 percent at the open on Wednesday, after Premier Li Qiang announced a target GDP growth of "around 5 percent" for 2025 and pledged to make domestic demand the "main engine" of its economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 258 points at 23,200 at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GDP growth target was announced on Wednesday in a report being presented by Premier Li at the opening session of the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, stocks racked up more losses on Wall Street on Tuesday, as a trade war between the US and its key trading partners escalated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. All three countries have announced retaliatory actions, sparking worries about a slowdown in the global economy. (Agencies)

    Arab leaders endorse Egypt's plan to rebuild Gaza

<img alt="Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty (R) meets with Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi (L) to discuss details of the Gaza reconstruction plan, ahead of the emergency Arab summit in Cairo.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arab leaders on Tuesday endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for Gaza that would allow its roughly two million Palestinians to remain, in a counterproposal to US President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$53 billion plan's endorsement by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo amounted to a rejection of Trump’s proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit conclusions were welcomed by Hamas, rejected by Israel and given a lukewarm response by the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi expressed his appreciation for “the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian People to stay on their land without displacement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post after the summit, el-Sissi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community “to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House welcomed input from Arab nations, but insisted Hamas could not remain in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Trump has been clear that Hamas cannot continue to govern Gaza,” White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the President stands by his bold vision for a post-war Gaza, he welcomes input from our Arab partners in the region. It’s clear his proposals have driven the region to come to the table rather than allow this issue to devolve into further crisis.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas welcomed the summit’s outcome, saying it marked a new phase of Arab and Islamic alignment with the Palestinian cause and that it valued Arab leaders’ rejection of attempts to transfer Palestinians from their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. (AP)

    China GDP growth tipped to reach 5pc in 2025

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it will aim for economic growth of around 5 percent in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the start of the National People's Congress session also outlined other goals for the year, including a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent, over 12 million new urban jobs, and an around 2 percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In setting the growth rate at around five percent, we have taken into account the need to stabilise employment, prevent risks and improve the people's well-being, as well as the potential for growth and the conditions supporting growth," the document said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A target of around five percent is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver," the document added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy grew by 5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also aims for a budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2025, up from 3 percent a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the work report, China will support and encourage private investment, and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country will issue 500 billion yuan of special treasury bonds this year to support large state-owned commercial banks in replenishing capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said that central authorities are keenly aware of the problems and challenges confronting China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,” Li said, describing them as increasingly complex and severe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Global economic growth lacks steam, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, the multilateral trading system is experiencing disruptions and tariff barriers continue to increase.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also noted that the "foundation for China‘s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough", saying that demand is weak and consumption is sluggish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Greater efforts need to be made to address social problems and guard against risks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stay committed to pursuing progress while ensuring stability." (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    China's Liu Jiakun wins Pritzker Prize

<img alt="Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pritzker Prize, dubbed the 'Nobel' for architecture, was awarded on Tuesday to China's Liu Jiakun, for designs that celebrate "everyday lives".
 <br>
  <br>
  "In a global context where architecture is struggling to find adequate responses to fast evolving social and environmental challenges, Liu Jiakun has provided convincing answers that also celebrate the everyday lives of people as well as their communal and spiritual identities," the award's jury wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1956, Liu has worked on more than 30 projects in China ranging from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces and commercial buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Architecture should reveal something - it should abstract, distill and make visible the inherent qualities of local people," Liu said in the statement, evoking his craft's capacity to create "a sense of shared community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.
  <br>
  <br>
  His projects include the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, a large circular structure with a skylight that illuminates an interior strip of photographs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Aravena, who won the award in 2016 and is chair of the jury, said Liu's works offer "clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanisation" especially because they are sometimes "a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life," Aravena said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who is the 54th recipient of the Pritzker Prize, will be honoured at a celebration in Abu Dhabi in spring, award organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year's prize went to Japan's Riken Yamamoto, whose projects are credited with promoting human contact and who said at the time his objective was to "design architecture that can bring joy to people around it". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq veering near correction territory, as trade tensions escalated following US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with doubled duties on Chinese goods, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite ended lower after veering into correction territory during the session but pared losses in choppy trading. The index closed down 9.3 per cent from its record closing high on December 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in financials and industrials were the biggest losers among the benchmark S&P 500's 11 main sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 6.2 per cent and nearly 4 per cent, respectively, sending the bigger banks index down 4.7 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE market volatility index rose 3.20 per cent to its highest since December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.55 per cent, to 42,520, the S&P 500 lost 1.22 per cent, to 5,778 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.35 per cent, to 18,285.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car makers Ford and General Motors, which have vast supply chains across North America, fell 2.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. The domestically focused Russell 2000 index dropped 1 per cent. (Reuters)

    'China GDP could be affected by US tariffs'

<img alt="A finance expert says the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794282_1_20250305085101.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<img alt="Arsena's 7-1 win over PSV was their biggest victory away from home in any Champions League match. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794271_2_20250305071751.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid claimed a small edge on city rivals Atlético Madrid with a tight 2-1 Champions League last 16 first-leg win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julián Alvarez levelled for Atlético after Rodrygo Goes sent the hosts ahead, but Brahim Díaz stroked home the winner for the record 15-time winners to delight the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's Atlético, who lost in the 2014 and 2016 finals against their bitter rivals, kept stars Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappé quiet but still came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rojiblancos played it safe in the final stages, seeming to accept their one-goal disadvantage for the second leg derby clash at home next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti opted for Morocco international Díaz in midfield to replace the suspended Jude Bellingham and selected Fede Valverde at right-back after he was passed fit to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian had demanded his side show a better attitude and more commitment than during their La Liga defeat by Real Betis on Saturday and his charges delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo pounced after just four minutes, slipping inside Javi Galán to collect Valverde's teasing pass before firing home with his left foot across Jan Oblak and inside the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a moment we had the game under control, but we knew that it would not be an easy match, because they were at home and they have great players," Alvarez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we know there are 90 minutes to go," he added. "It's one goal, and another game, at home with our fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian winger's fifth strike of the tournament, habitually shining on the European stage for Madrid, where he boasts 25 goals in 61 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo wanted a penalty when Galán appeared to hold him back in the area but his appeals were waved away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético host Real Madrid next week at the Metropolitano stadium, with the winner facing Arsenal or PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal all but ensured a quarter-final berth as they crushed a shambolic PSV 7-1 in Eindhoven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jurrien Timber headed Arsenal into the lead on 18 minutes before Ethan Nwaneri smashed a second. Mikel Merino, from a narrow angle, put the visitors three goals up in just the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noa Lang hit back with a PSV penalty before half-time. But Martin Odegaard slotted home a rebound and Leandro Trossard dinked a goal as Arsenal scored twice in the first three minutes of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard added another with 12 minutes left and then set up defender Riccardo Calafiori, a first-half replacement, to round off the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were fluid. We had enthusiasm, the drive and the hunger," Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. "We need to keep pushing as a team with the mentality." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he wanted to "make things right" with Donald Trump and work under the US president's "strong leadership" to secure a lasting peace in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his first public comments since Trump halted US military aid to Ukraine, Zelensky said his public bust-up with Trump last week was "regrettable" and pledged to sign a key minerals deal with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for a "truce" in the sea and sky as a first step to ending the three-year war with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic collapse in the Kyiv-Washington wartime alliance has played out in the open since a televised dispute between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office last week, mounting as Ukraine's top ally suspended crucial military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts," Zelensky wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be," the Ukrainian leader added. "It is time to make things right."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told Ukrainians in his regular evening address he had instructed his defence and intelligence chiefs to contact their US counterparts to "get official information" on the aid freeze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning decision Monday to halt assistance to Ukraine deepened fears in Kyiv and many European capitals that America was pivoting away from its allies -- and towards Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow hailed Trump's decision, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a "solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union, which -- along with Ukraine -- is excluded from US-Russian negotiations towards a potential truce, has been scrambling to bolster support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky for his willingness to "re-engage in dialogue" with Trump, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Europe is fearing for the future of US-European defence cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen presented an EU plan to mobilise some 800 billion euros (US$840 billion) for Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany's likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said he would support the immediate approval of a three-billion-euro Ukraine aid package held up in parliament, calling it "urgent".
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU on Thursday is to hold an emergency summit aimed at cementing joint European support for Ukraine. (AFP)

    Mavs' Irving ruled out for NBA season with ACL injury

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dallas Mavericks All Star guard Kyrie Irving will miss the rest of the NBA season after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, according to media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Irving sustained the injury during Monday's loss to the Sacramento Kings and the news is a massive blow to a Mavericks team already grappling with a turbulent season following the trade of star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving, 32, hyperextended his knee, falling while he drove to the basket and was carried off court.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic cited sources saying the injury had been confirmed as a season-ending ACL.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Irving left the court, Jaden Hardy then turned his ankle in the third quarter and had to leave the game, adding to a growing injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, beaten by the Boston Celtics in last year's NBA finals, has been reeling since trading superstar Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February for Anthony Davis, a blockbuster move aimed at retooling the roster around Irving and Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Davis has been sidelined with an adductor strain, while P.J Washington, Dereck Lively, Daniel Gifford and Caleb Martin are all on the injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavericks have lost four of their last five games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just seems every time we get close to get someone back, someone else goes down, we are running out of bodies here," said Mavs head coach Jason Kidd after Monday's loss. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Virat Kohli produced a trademark innings with a polished 84 as India pulled off a tense chase to beat Australia by four wickets in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set 265 for victory, India lost the 36-year-old Kohli in the closing overs but KL Rahul's unbeaten 42 steered the team home with 11 balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will face South Africa or New Zealand in the final on Sunday in Dubai, with India playing all their matches at the venue after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan for the eight-nation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore was the alternative venue for the final had India missed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game is all about pressure, especially in big games like semis and finals," said player of the match Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you go deep into the innings and have wickets in hand, the opposition usually gives in and the game becomes easier. It is very important to control your impulses while the game is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia elected to bat and posted 264 all out after strong knocks from captain Steve Smith, who made 73, and Alex Carey, who hit 61.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply India lost two early wickets before Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, who made 45, put the chase back on track in their partnership of 91.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take pride in doing what my team wants," added the 36-year-old Kohli. "Individual records don't matter anymore for me. It's just about stepping out and hopefully doing the job for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's arguably the best chaser the game has seen. He's done it numerous times against us," Smith said of Kohli. "He controls the tempo of the game really well, plays to his strengths and takes the game deep."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooper Connolly, in the team in place of the injured Matthew Short who was forced out of the tournament on Monday, trapped skipper Rohit Sharma lbw on 28 for his first ODI wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli and Iyer then took stock against an inexperienced Australian attack missing fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood to injuries and Mitchell Starc for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But leg-spinner Adam Zampa bowled Iyer before Nathan Ellis rattled the stumps of Axar Patel for 27. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the United States over President Donald Trump's tariff increases on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement comes a day after Trump ordered additional tariffs against Chinese goods, increasing previously imposed 10 percent levies to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, adding that it was "strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed" to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US tariffs, Beijing has imposed new duties on a range of agricultural imports from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The additional 15 percent tariffs on products including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton are due to come into effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will, in accordance with WTO rules, firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and defend... the international economic and trade order," the Commerce Ministry statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A WTO official confirmed to AFP that the new complaint from China had been received. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Judd Trump made a winning start in Hong Kong, beating Gary Wilson to advance to the last 16 of the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who recently obtained Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was playing on home soil for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was fellow Englishman Wilson who started off strong and took the first frame. Trump struck back with a 142 break to level things up, before going on to win the best-of-seven match 4-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old will next face another Englishman Jack Lisowski.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other first-round action, English stars Shaun Murphy and David Gilbert both secured narrow 4-3 victories to reach the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and officiated at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the ranking tournament will be a huge success and hoped that players and visitors would have an unforgettable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  This six-day event marks the first official sports competition at the Kai Tak Sports Park, with over 4,200 people attending on the first day.

    Xia tells NPC delegates to serve with sense of mission

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs has told delegates to the national legislative body to ride on the stock market boom and boost economic development in the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also expressed confidence that the city can "weather the storm" in face of challenges posed by geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments on Tuesday during a closed-door exchange with National People's Congress (NPC) delegates from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Starry Lee, said the central government highly recognised the work of the Hong Kong administration on supporting the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the city's economy has been relatively stable, and achieved moderate growth of 2.5 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that Hong Kong’s economy is relatively stable … especially the stock market, the volume [went up]. All these [were contributed by] the support of the central government," she told reporters after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming future, we will continue as NPC (members) to act as (contributors) to the economic development, and to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong people."
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok said the director singled out the city's stock market as an area of focus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia] did mention the stock market rally in recent months. He said if this trend continues, it will certainly boost Hong Kong's economy," Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if geopolitics had been part of the conversation, the delegates quoted Xia as saying that some of the pressure faced by the country would "inevitably pass down to Hong Kong", but such challenges could be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the office said Xia expressed the hope for the delegates to perform their duties "with a sense of responsibility and mission" and reflect public opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement went on to say the director told the members to fully support their respective SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia urged Hong Kong delegates to expedite the city's transition from stability to prosperity, and those from Macau to promote moderate economic diversification, the statement added.

 EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday presented a five-part plan to mobilise some US$844 billion for Europe's defence, and help provide "immediate" military support for Ukraine after Washington suspended military aid.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move came hours after US President Donald Trump announced the aid freeze, intensifying Washington's push for a peace deal with Russia and confirming its pivot away from its European allies and partners in backing Kyiv's war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new era is upon us," the European Commission president said in a letter presenting the plan to EU leaders, two days before a summit aimed at cementing joint action on support for Ukraine and boosting Europe's defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rearm Europe' could mobilise close to US$844 billion of defence expenditures for a safe and resilient Europe," von der Leyen told reporters as she outlined the plan, which includes a US$158 billion loan facility along with steps to free up large-scale defence investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how fast funds could be made available under the proposals, which need approval by member states, nor how quickly this could translate into battlefield support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  It proposes that the EU ease strict budget rules, which oblige states to keep public deficits below three percent of gross domestic product, to allow them to ramp up spending on defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secondly, the plan calls for a new "instrument" to provide US$157 billion of loans to member states for defence investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are talking about pan-European capability domains - for example, air and missile defence, artillery systems, missiles and ammunition drones and anti-drone systems," said von der Leyen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's Brussels summit, after weekend crisis talks also involving Britain and Nato, comes as Europe contemplates the prospect of the United States withdrawing longer-term support from Ukraine and more broadly from its European allies. (AFP)
