<div class="itemFullText">
 A 36-year-old man died on Sunday after reportedly fainting and falling backwards while on an escalator in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim's mother reported the incident  at the Sha Kok Estate at around 2pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was reportedly going up on the escalator connecting a wet market and a shopping mall.
  <br>
  <br>
  And as he fell backwards, he hit a 65-year-old woman who suffered a minor injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was rushed to Prince of Wales Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

    'HK Coliseum can focus even more on entertainment'

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the Hong Kong Coliseum could be repositioned for entertainment. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786214_1_20250105172615.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said some of its venues could focus on entertainment after the opening of more sports facilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said on a TVB programme that the positioning of the existing public venues can be different after new facilities such as Kai Tak Sports Park and the East Kowloon Cultural Centre are opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some venues, like the Hong Kong Coliseum, could focus on holding entertainment shows instead of sports events in future, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the past, some people would say the Hong Kong Coliseum should give sports events priority. But now we have Kai Tai Sports Parks and other new facilities. Can we think of different positioning on venues, such as some places are mainly for sports events while some for entertainment?” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, nearly 60 percent of events held at the Hong Kong Coliseum were concerts, more than 20 percent were sports events, while the rest were activities like graduation ceremonies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government will finalise the recommendations on stage construction regulation in the first quarter of this year, after a giant LED screen fell and injured dancers during the MIRROR concert in July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the recommendations will mainly apply to the Hong Kong Coliseum and Queen Elizabeth Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some rules will also apply to Kai Tak Sports Park.

    First test event held at Kai Tak main stadium 'smooth'

<img alt="Officials said Sunday's test was the first of a series of trial events before the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament in March. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786207_1_20250105155152.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rugby tournament featuring university students was held at the Kai Tak Sports Park on Sunday, the first test event at the main stadium there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials described the test event as generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 10,000 spectators were expected inside the 50,000-strong venue, with free seating and multiple entry and exit allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of spectators were unaware of the rule that water bottles were not allowed inside the venue, and had to put them away for temporary storage.
  <br>
  <br>
  A player from Hang Seng University said he's happy with the experience both on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good because this is a standard-sized pitch with real grass. We always play on artificial grass, which hurts more when you fall," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The facilities are also much better at Kai Tak. Say at Kings Park Sports Ground, the changing rooms aren't as big. Here, every team has its own changing room. There's ice for cold therapy, and there's an area for each team member."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator, who works in public relations, said he's glad to make his first visit to the state-of-the-art venue along with many other members of the public, even though the atmosphere at the test event may not be as good as that at the Rugby Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a really nice venue, different from the Hong Kong Stadium. When you come inside Kai Tak Stadium, you feel that Hong Kong has a world-class stadium. I've been to similar stadiums in other major cities, and now we have our very own," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang and Sports Commissioner George Choi were among the officials on hand to inspect the operations, and they found the arrangements generally smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Tang said the authorities will host three more tests involving at least 65,000 people for the main stadium and other venues at the Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said various scenarios will be simulated to get officials ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby tournament involved 17 teams, with the games lasting for the whole day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kai Tak main stadium will host the Rugby Sevens in late March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Runners who took part in this year’s Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon said they were happy with the arrangements after issues were raised in the event’s inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 people took part in Sunday's race, which covered the local section of the 55-kilometre mega-bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race for the challenge group of runners started at 7.15am, and the remaining three non-challenge groups began in batches about half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A runner from Yunnan, surnamed Jian, said she previously ran in the plateau and wanted to experience something different.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Running here is totally different. You're on the bridge and over the sea, while elsewhere it's just road running. I think the arrangement is pretty good. The volunteers are really enthusiastic and there are clear signs,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some runners who participated in the November 2023 race complained about not being offered enough sports drinks or snacks, as well as the lack of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s race is designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many elite marathon runners took part, including Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, who won the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner. “I'm happy to see so many runners cheering for me,” he spoke through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha came first in the challenge group in just over an hour, while Grace Nawowuna from Kenya took the women’s title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong See-yeung and Virginia Lo were the first SAR man and woman to finish the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong, who also ran in 2023, said the facilities, including the toilets, were much better compared with the previous race.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he was thrilled and honoured to be able to run alongside Kawauchi.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel very inspired because he is a role model for me. As an Asian athlete with a larger build similar to mine, he resonates with me. He started as a recreational runner and has achieved results comparable to, or even better than, professional athletes. This serves as a great motivation for us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, meanwhile, was about 40 seconds off her personal best. She said the overall experience was great, though the uphill tunnel section was the toughest part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law called the start of the challenge group race.
  <br>
  <br>
  She and other officials, including justice chief Paul Lam and security minister Chris Tang, took part in a special 2-kilometre race.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Midway through the race I noticed the sunrise is magnificent. So, it’s really half sports, half tourism,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates also told me that for future large-scale events, they plan to invite not just elite runners from abroad but also those who are overseas travellers. When they come, there’s no reason to just run the marathon – they'll likely stay a night and spend money. I totally support this idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, 19 runners said they felt unwell and suffered injuries and three were sent to hospital for treatment as of 11am.

<img alt="Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens finishes the regular season with 4,172 yards passing and 915 yards rushing, the best combined record for an NFL quarterback. File photo: Tommy Gilligan-Imagn Images via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786202_1_20250105140836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamar Jackson threw two touchdown passes and the Baltimore Ravens won the AFC North for the second straight season, clinching the division with a 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the other NFL game on Saturday, the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens (12-5) will open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before winning its final four to finish on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pittsburgh, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow passed for 277 yards and a touchdown and Cade York kicked four field goals in Cincinnati's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burrow also threw an interception and his NFL record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns came to an end. But he did enough to propel the Bengals (9-8) to their fifth straight win and keep them in the mix until the season's final day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cincinnati will earn the seventh seed in the AFC if Denver loses to Kansas City and Miami either loses to or ties the New York Jets on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh is assured of playing next week despite a four-game losing streak. The Steelers will be the fifth seed if the Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, Pittsburgh will be the sixth seed and travel to rival Baltimore in the first round. (AP)

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong needs to maintain its low and simple tax regime to stay competitive. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786199_1_20250105134449.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will focus on cutting expenditure to tackle a fiscal deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the deficit for the current fiscal year is expected to reach just under HK$100 billion, Chan wrote in his weekly blog that public works projects will be prioritised, with the Northern Metropolis as well as housing and economic development projects getting resources first.
  <br>
  <br>
  For other infrastructure projects, the government will raise capital by issuing bonds and through public-private partnership, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from further controlling the spending of various departments, Chan said the government will review certain funding schemes that could affect the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It is inevitable for us to look into some funding schemes as their expenditure growth will bring significant long-term impact to the public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said various departments will be asked to further control their spending, including reallocating resources and prioritising works to better meet the needs of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is the key to improve public finance,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy will focus on cost-cutting, in which we will control the increase in recurrent expenditures, under the premise of maintaining and improving public service.”
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, Chan stressed the need for the government to stick to a low and simple tax system to order to maintain Hong Kong's competitive edge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said officials will follow the user pays principle, so as to minimise the impact to the average people.

    User pays principle can help boost revenue: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, said on Sunday that the user pays principle is among the factors at play when officials consider ways to widen the tax base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Amid a multi-year budget deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Saturday that officials were considering having high-income earners pay more tax, in line with the principle of having people pay more if they can afford to.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui stressed after attending a Commercial Radio programme that officials are considering ways to find new sources of revenue and cut expenses at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we'll consider how these measures affect the people. And we'll also look at adopting the principle of user pays, such that we can achieve a stable fiscal management in a sustainable manner," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the show, Hui noted that Hong Kong is capable of embracing the world as shown in the government's drive to expand into new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, he said Indonesia and other countries have said they plan to issue bonds in the SAR, while some firms had expressed interest in setting up family offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said Hong Kong's status as the country's international financial centre will become more prominent going forward, thanks to an increase in cross-border trading of financial products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that as mainland firms become more competitive globally, the SAR can help them expand overseas by providing them with professional services and serving as a fund-raising platform.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they smashed a syndicate that allegedly made use of deepfake technology to conduct investment scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers raided two locations in neighbouring industrial buildings in Kowloon Bay last week and arrested 31 people, aged between 20 and 34.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the total amount of losses exceeded HK$34 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the syndicate had been operating for more than a year, and the victims were mainly from outside of Hong Kong, such as Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung Pui-kei, superintendent with the Commercial Crime Bureau, said the syndicate made use of deepfake technology to build relationships online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also make use of the new technology, like AI face-swapping technology, to [pretend] to be some good-looking ladies and gentlemen to induce potential victims, gain their trust and develop into romance relationships in order to commence the romance scams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once gaining their trust, the syndicate persuaded people to send money to a fake investment platform, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the raids, officers seized HK$10 million worth of suspected criminal gains, including cash, handbags and luxury watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of those arrested said they were unemployed, while some were university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five of those held, among them core syndicate members, have been charged with conspiracy to defraud. They'll appear at Eastern Court on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other suspects were released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last October, the force took down a syndicate operating in a similar way, and police are trying to determine if the two cases were connected.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton received a standing ovation as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former president Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation’s highest civilian honour in a White House ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the final time as president I have the honour bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation’s highest civilian honour, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,” Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done to help this country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defence; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy is father to Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, “Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Romney is the father of former Utah Republican senator Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has days left in the Presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to military veterans, law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made “exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavours.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognised food relief organisations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: “As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honour."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports and entertainment stars recognised include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin “Magic” Johnson; actor Michael J Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson’s disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as “Bill Nye the Science Guy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue Magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, US House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa. (AP)

    World bids farewell to Jimmy Carter

<img alt="An honour guard watches over the casket of former President Jimmy Carter at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786178_1_20250105094240.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter's extended public farewell began on Saturday in Georgia, with the 39th US president’s casket tracing his long arc from the Depression-era South and family farming business to the pinnacle of American political power and decades as a global humanitarian.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those chapters shone throughout the opening stanza of a six-day state funeral intended to blend personalised memorials with the ceremonial pomp afforded to former presidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter died on December 29, aged 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He was an amazing man. He was held up and propped up and soothed by an amazing woman,” son James Earl “Chip” Carter III, told mourners at The Carter Center, referring to his father and former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who died in 2023 . “The two of them together changed the world. And it was an amazing thing to watch so close.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Grandson Jason Carter, who now chairs the center's governing board, said, “It's amazing what you can cram into a hundred years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren accompanied their patriarch as his hearse rode first through his hometown of Plains. The procession stopped at the farm where the future president toiled alongside the Black sharecroppers who worked for his father. The motorcade continued to Atlanta, stopping in front of the Georgia Capitol where Carter served as a state senator and reformist governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finally, he arrived for his last visit to the Carter Presidential Center, which houses his presidential library and The Carter Center where he based his post-White House advocacy for public health, democracy and human rights, setting a new standard for what former presidents can accomplish after they yield power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His spirit fills this place,” Jason Carter told the assembly that included some of the center's 3,000 employees worldwide. “You continue the vibrant living legacy of what is my grandfather’s life work,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pallbearers on Saturday came from the Secret Service that protected the Carters for almost a half-century and a military honour guard that included Navy service members for the only US Naval Academy graduate to reach the Oval Office. A military band played “Hail to the Chief” and the hymn “Be Thou My Vision” for the commander in chief who also was a devout Baptist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter will remain at the Carter Presidential Center from 7pm on Saturday through 6am on Tuesday, so the public can pay their respects around the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  National rites will continue in Washington and conclude on Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral, followed by a return to Plains. There, the former president will be buried next to his wife of 77 years near the home they built before his first state Senate campaign in 1962. (AP)

    City crush West Ham; Arsenal, Chelsea settle for draws

<img alt="Manchester City's Erling Haaland scores City's second goal past West Ham United's Alphonse Areola. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786172_1_20250105083027.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland and Manchester City might just be turning the corner after the team's worst run of results under Pep Guardiola.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haaland scored twice in a 4-1 win over West Ham on Saturday as City secured back-to-back victories in the Premier League for the first time since late October, when a shocking and unthinkable six-week meltdown began.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that time, the defending champions played nine league games and won just once, dropping them out of the Champions League qualification spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, City can hope for better times ahead - making up ground on second-placed Arsenal and fourth-placed Chelsea after they both dropped points in draws at Brighton and Crystal Palace, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Guardiola wasn't getting carried away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased for the result," he said, “but you cannot ask me if the old City is back. If you saw the game, we are not.”
  <br>
  <br>
  However, while the 2-0 win at Leicester last weekend was unconvincing, there were better signs against West Ham - at least in attack with Haaland looking sharp. The Norway striker headed in Savinho's cross to make it 2-0 in the 42nd minute and chipped the goalkeeper for 3-0 in the 55th after running onto another pass from Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Either side, there was an own-goal and a strike from Phil Foden before Niclas Fullkrug pulled one back for West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are still not like we were, for different reasons,” Guardiola said. "The result will help. We struggle but it is a release.”
  <br>
  <br>
  City stayed in sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, it was a good day for Liverpool - and the league leader didn't even play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were held to 1-1 at Brighton, which equalised from the penalty spot through Joao Pedro, and missed the chance to trim the gap to Liverpool to three points. Ethan Nwaneri put Arsenal ahead and, at age 17, became only the sixth player under 18 to score multiple Premier League goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's penalty was awarded after Arsenal defender William Saliba was adjudged to have clashed heads with Pedro as they challenged for a bouncing ball. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was disappointed with the call, saying: “I have never seen a decision like this in my career. I asked the boys if they have and nobody has seen it before.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's winless run in the league extended to four matches after drawing at Palace 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta equalised in the 82nd for Palace, cancelling out Cole Palmer's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have drawn twice and lost twice since December 22, damaging a title bid that had been picking up some steam, even if manager Enzo Maresca never accepted his team was a realistic challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still created so many chances in front of goal but it's about getting the end product," Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho said. “We're still playing the same football, we are still giving 100 percent. This is what happens in football.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead Arsenal by five points and Chelsea by nine, and have two games in hand over both rivals. The first comes at home to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak scored in a seventh straight Premier League game to earn Newcastle a 2-1 win at injury-hit Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker grabbed the 38th-minute winner and there was a hint of fortune about it, with Tottenham defender Radu Drăgușin getting the slightest of touches on a cross and deflecting the ball onto the foot of Isak. The ball dribbled into the net for Isak's 13th goal of the season, and ninth in his past seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Tuchel was in the stands in his first scouting mission in his role as the recently hired England coach. Two players likely to be in his first squad, to be announced in March for World Cup qualifiers, got on the score sheet in the opening six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham ahead in the fourth minute, and Anthony Gordon equalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a fifth straight win for fifth-placed Newcastle, while Tottenham stayed in the bottom half of the standings with just one point from their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were beaten by Brentford 5-0 at home for a third straight defeat under Ivan Juric, who was hired last month to replace the fired Russell Martin. Southampton have one point from four games under Juric and just six points overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo scored two of Brentford's goals and has 13 for the season in the league. It was Brentford's biggest ever win in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat Leicester 2-1, while Bournemouth won at home to Everton 1-0 and was eight games unbeaten - a club record in their time in the Premier League. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  The security service, along with military troops, on Friday prevented prosecutors from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol in a six-hour standoff inside Yoon's compound. The investigators secured the warrant to arrest Yoon over his brief declaration of martial law last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is investigating the case, said on Saturday it had again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the nation's finance minister, to order the presidential security service to cooperate with the warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police asked the chief of the presidential security service, Park Chong-jun, to appear for questioning on Tuesday, Yonhap News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 martial law declaration stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said on Saturday. She was 116.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on December 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavoured Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, “Thank you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-metre (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is survived by one son, one daughter, and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Gerontology Research Group, the world's oldest person is now 116-year-old Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka. (AP)

 The Miami Heat suspended Jimmy Butler for seven games on Friday and said they will seek to trade him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NBA team said the suspension was for “conduct detrimental to the team over the course of the season and particularly the last several weeks.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through his actions and statements, he has shown he no longer wants to be part of this team,” the Heat said in a statement, one day after Butler said in a post-game press conference that he does not believe he can be happy playing in Miami going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will lose about US$336,543 per game during the suspension, or about US$2,355,798 in all. He has the right to an appeal, which could lessen the financial hit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will not be with the team for its home game on Saturday against Utah and then the totality of a six-game road trip to Sacramento, Golden State, Utah, Portland, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In theory, the earliest that Butler could play again for the Heat is January 17 at home against Denver. But he has likely played for Miami for the final time. (AP)

    'Only buy concert tickets through official channels'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are advising people to refrain from buying concert tickets through unofficial channels, following the arrest of five men for allegedly selling counterfeit tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai Kwong-fai, an inspector with the Kowloon City District Crime Squad, said on Saturday that officers have received more than 20 reports of suspected scams in the past few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said victims claimed they purchased concert tickets from various online platforms and social media at inflated prices through unofficial sources, only to find out at the venue that their tickets were fake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The counterfeit concert tickets we seized look authentic, whether it was the font or paper quality, so it is challenging for the average person to tell the difference," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The scammers also arranged for in-person meetings with the victims and provided ticket verification methods in order to convince them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tai said the five men, aged between 18 and 45, have been arrested on suspicion of obtaining property by deception.

    Myanmar frees thousands of prisoners, but not Suu Kyi

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar’s military government has released more than 6,000 prisoners and has reduced other inmates’ sentences as part of a mass amnesty marking the 77th anniversary of independence from Britain on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  They included just a small proportion of hundreds of political detainees jailed for opposing army rule since the military seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. That takeover was met with massive nonviolent resistance, which has since become a widespread armed struggle.
  <br>
  <br>
  State-run MRTV television reported that Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the military government, granted amnesties covering 5,864 prisoners from Myanmar, as well as 180 foreigners who will be deported. Mass prisoner releases are common on holidays and other significant occasions in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate report, it said Min Aung Hlaing had commuted the life sentences of 144 prisoners to 15 years' imprisonment. The report provided no details about them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. In the country’s largest city, Yangon, buses took prisoners out of Insein Prison, where friends and families of detainees had waited since morning for the announced releases, at around 11:30 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since it seized power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old Suu Kyi is serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted in a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters and independent analysts say the cases against her are an attempt to discredit her and legitimise the military’s seizure of power while keeping her from taking part in the military’s promised election, for which no date has yet been set. (AP)

    Teen darts sensation Littler wins PDC world title

<img alt="17-year-old Luke 'The Nuke' Littler celebrates becoming the youngest-ever world champion. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786125_1_20250104152712.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seventeen-year-old sensation Luke 'The Nuke' Littler thrashed Michael van Gerwen 7-3 on Friday to become the youngest ever PDC darts world champion and bank a 500,000 pound (US$621,600) winner's cheque.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duel for the biggest prize in darts, in front of 3,200 rowdy fans in fancy dress, ended in a crushing defeat for three times winner Van Gerwen, 35, in his seventh final at North London's 'Ally Pally' Alexandra Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe it. Honestly, I can't believe it," gasped the teenager, tears in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon, whose meteoric rise started by throwing magnetic darts as a toddler, had finally achieved the dream after losing 7-4 last year in a final that made him a household name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We both played so well. I said in my interviews, I needed to get off to a quick start tonight and that's what I did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone dreams of lifting this trophy but you've got to get through a tough field."
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler took a cagey opening set and then found his rhythm with two quick 180s to go 2-0 up, winning six of the first seven legs, as Van Gerwen's finishing touch failed him and he grimaced in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen, who will walk away 200,000 pounds richer as runner-up, won the opening leg of the third set but it proved a false dawn as an implacable Littler raced 4-0 clear with a bullseye finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch 'Green Machine', who set the previous record for youngest world champion as a 24-year-old in 2014, showed he was still in the fight by taking the fifth set but the comeback faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler, hand steady and gaze unwavering, fired in quick back-to-back 180s to take the opening leg of the sixth and then banged in two more maximum scores to secure the set and forge 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen raised his game to pull back to 5-2 but Littler, who ended the tournament with the most 180s, whitewashed the next set to restore his advantage to 6-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another set to the Dutchman only postponed the inevitable as Littler, who turns 18 on January 21, romped through the final set to get his hands on the mighty Sid Waddell Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pent-up emotion was finally released by two bullseyes and a double 16 to check out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learnt a lot last year," he said as the celebrations died down. "Earlier today I watched all of the (2024 final) game back against Luke (Humphries) and I had the visions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could end 2025 winning absolutely nothing (more) but I've picked up one of the best."
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen said he had not done himself justice, and it hurt, "but that's the way it is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fair play to him. Every chance he got, every moment he had to hurt me, he did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sometimes say every 17 years a star gets born and he's one of them." (Reuters)

    'Make visitors fall back in love with HK a main goal'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has vowed to make visitors "fall back in love" with Hong Kong, stressing that she would not dwell on tourist numbers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong saw 45 million tourist arrivals in total last year, falling slightly short of the previous estimate of 46 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't necessarily have to strive for very high numbers," Law said in a television interview on Saturday when asked if she hoped tourist numbers this year would return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there was a time before Covid when some suggested Hong Kong might be welcoming too many tourists and there could be room for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that now we should gradually make people fall in love with Hong Kong, or love Hong Kong again, and feel that they will always want to come back to visit. This is my biggest goal for the coming year," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of the city's cruise terminal set out in a recent tourism blueprint, Law said authorities could require future operators to make a pledge to bring in vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials earlier said they would put the managing rights of the terminal up for tender in 2025, three years before the existing contract expires, while reviewing the terms and conditions to make the port more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said authorities could make firms hoping to join the tender exercise commit to having cruise ships dock at the terminal for a certain number of days.

    Legco was fast but diligent, says Andrew Leung

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Saturday brushed off suggestions that the legislature had sacrificed diligence for speed, after passing 34 bills over the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Leung said every bill is comprehensively reviewed from start to finish, with lawmakers working with officials in a pragmatic and collaborative manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted the enactment of homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law as a pivotal accomplishment in 2024, stressing that councillors had been anything but sloppy in the legislative process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We held meetings for seven days, from nine in the morning to seven at night, and asked about 2,000 questions,” Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are 182 sections [in the bill], and we revised 91 of them – which is an unprecedented number. So, were we careless and simply raising our hands in support because that's what the authorities wanted? No, we put a lot of effort into this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to concerns about the cost of a Legco duty visit to Japan at the end of last year, Leung said that discussions during the visit were productive and covered many practical issues, including Hong Kong's considerations regarding food imports from Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the expenses were in accordance with guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We followed the guidelines and did not spend more than necessary. In fact, we were very frugal. We were there for an official visit, not to indulge," he said.

    Economic boost amid deficit 'main challenge': FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday warned that promoting economic development amid a fiscal deficit would be Hong Kong's "main challenge", saying the government is studying how to boost income and cut costs to achieve a balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's "Voices from the Hall", where he gathered public feedback ahead of the upcoming budget, Chan said Hong Kong's economy grew steadily in the first three quarters of 2024 but not as strongly as expected due to high interest rates and geopolitical factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government is focusing on cost-cutting to tackle a deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although we need to move forward with public works projects and develop the Northern Metropolis, we have to prioritise developments according to their urgency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we need to study how to increase revenue, based on the principle that people who can afford to pay more do pay more, to minimise the impact on Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong's property slump would drop in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our property market has been experiencing an adjustment period, due to external factors and the high interest rate environment, among other reasons," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] property prices in Hong Kong have stabilised and transaction volume has increased."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the government will not restore a land-sale mechanism, which was scrapped more than a decade ago, in response to an attendee's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abolished in 2013, the application-based mechanism had allowed developers to apply for, and then offer a price for sites listed by the government, before authorities put the plot up for sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the government takes the lead with every quarterly land sale. We can assess the situation to see how many plots of land we're putting up for sale, what type of land is being sold, and how we're going to put those parcels out to market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After some attendees wanted to discuss the government's HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, the financial chief said labour and welfare officials are studying different views on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary is set to deliver his next budget speech on February 26.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 in the criminal case in which he was convicted on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star, but is unlikely to face jail time or other penalties, a judge said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Justice Juan Merchan's ruling means Trump will be required to appear at a court hearing just 10 days before his Jan. 20 inauguration - an unprecedented scenario in US history. Before Trump, no US president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote that he was not inclined to sentence Trump to jail, and that a sentence of "unconditional discharge" - meaning no custody, monetary fine, or probation - would be "the most viable solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The imposition of the sentence would pave the way for Trump to appeal. Merchan acknowledged in his ruling that Trump has made clear he intends to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said there should be no sentencing in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan announced his plan for the sentencing in denying Trump's motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory. Trump's defense lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan rejected that argument, writing that setting aside the jury's verdict would "undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant's status as President-elect does not require the drastic and 'rare' application of (the court's) authority to grant the (dismissal) motion," Merchan wrote in the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan also rejected Trump's argument in a December 3 court filing that dismissal was warranted because his "civic and financial contributions to this city and the Nation are too numerous to count."
  <br>
  <br>
  While acknowledging Trump's service as president, the judge said Trump's public statements excoriating the justice system were also a factor for him in determining how Trump's character would factor into the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan criticized what he called Trump's "unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks" against the integrity of the criminal proceeding, and noted that he had found him guilty of 10 counts of contempt during the trial for repeatedly violating an order restricting out-of-court statements about witnesses and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole," Merchan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defendant's character and history vis-a-vis the Rule of Law and the Third Branch of government must be analyzed," the judge said, referring to the judiciary. "In that vein, it does not weigh in his favor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case stemmed from a US$130,000 payment that Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The payment was for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Manhattan jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment. He had pleaded not guilty and called the case an attempt by Manhattan District Attorney Bragg, the Democratic prosecutor who brought the charges, to harm his 2024 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sentencing was initially scheduled for July 11, 2024, but has been pushed back several times. On Thursday, Merchan said Trump's request in August that the sentencing be pushed back until after the election implied that he consented to being sentenced during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendant's victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous," Merchan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bragg did not oppose delaying the sentencing until after the election. Merchan in September pushed it back to November 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, the judge delayed the sentencing indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bragg's office had argued there were measures short of the "extreme remedy" of overturning the jury's verdict that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president, such as delaying the sentence until after Trump leaves the White House in 2029.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merchan wrote on Thursday he found that alternative "less desirable" than sentencing Trump before the inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on December 16 lost a separate bid to toss the hush money conviction in light of the US Supreme Court's July 1 decision that presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted over their official actions, and that evidence of their official actions cannot be presented in criminal cases over personal conduct.
  <br>
  <br>
  In denying Trump's motion to dismiss, Merchan said the prosecution over "decidedly personal acts of falsifying business records poses no danger of intrusion on the authority and function of the executive branch."
  <br>
  <br>
  Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison, but incarceration is not required. Before his election victory, legal experts said it was unlikely Trump would be locked up due to his lack of a criminal history and advanced age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was charged in three other state and federal criminal cases in 2023: one involving classified documents he kept after leaving office and two others involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pleaded not guilty in all three cases. The Justice Department moved to dismiss the two federal cases after Trump's election victory.

    Expert calls for children to get flu jabs early

<div class="itemFullText">
 Infectious diseases expert Ivan Hung said on Saturday that children should get their influenza vaccinations ahead of the Lunar New Year to anticipate an expected flu spike in kindergartens and primary schools.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the University of Hong Kong professor said children as young as six months old can get the flu jab.
  <br>
  <br>
  While getting vaccinated is highly recommended, he also reminded the public of the need for personal hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children at school should wash their hands frequently and, of course, if they have symptoms of influenza or flu, then they should not be going to school, they should be staying at home. Of course, if they have minor symptoms, then they could wear a mask and still go to school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are the important measures, but most important of all is still getting the influenza vaccine for children. There's still enough time to get the vaccine before the Chinese New Year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung also said a significant number of people returning to Hong Kong from Japan have exhibited flu symptoms, possibly due to the colder winter temperatures in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those who are just coming back from overseas, then of course, if they have symptoms of influenza or flu, then they should be seeing doctors. They should do a rapid test and they could see a doctor and get treatment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's usually quite minor for children, so they could get a Panadol, paracetamol, some nasal decongestants, some medication for that. I would recommend staying at home until they fully recover before going to school."

<img alt="Wall Street closed higher on Friday, but still lost ground over the week. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786083_1_20250104053256.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rebounded on Friday as investors neared the end of a holiday-shortened week that also rang in a new year, which brought with it expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts and looser regulatory policies from the incoming administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  A broad rally sent all three major US stock indexes to a higher close, with megacap growth companies, such as Tesla and Nvidia, providing much of the muscle to the upside and putting the Nasdaq out front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even so, all three indexes posted modest declines for the week, with the S&P 500 logging its third weekly loss in four.
  <br>
  <br>
  A multi-session selloff put a dour finish on what was a banner year for the equities market, as continued momentum of artificial intelligence technology and the U.S. Federal Reserve's first policy rate cuts in three-and-a-half years helped fuel double-digit gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the late-in-the-year weakness, and a very oversold market, we finally saw some buyers step in," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. "Obviously the past week-and-a-half has been disappointing for the bulls, but volume has been light and there hasn't been a lot of news."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's just remember, starting next week, on Monday, that's when a lot of the big money managers come back to the desk," Detrick added. "We'll see if this bullish trend can continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers' index (PMI) surprised to the upside by gaining 0.9 point to 49.3, its highest reading since March, nudging ever closer to expansion territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of fairly robust economic data has called into question the need for additional interest rate cuts from the Fed in the near term due to the possibility of re-igniting inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the US 2025 economic outlook was positive, despite uncertainty about the impact of trade and other policies that may be pursued by the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly elected Congress convened for its first session on Friday, and US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take the oath of office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump's proposals - which include cutting corporate taxes, easing regulations and imposing tariffs - could boost corporate profits and energize the economy, they also risk placing upward pressure on inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 339.86 points, or 0.80 percent, to 42,732.13, the S&P 500 gained 73.92 points, or 1.26 percent, to 5,942.47 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 340.89 points, or 1.77 percent to 19,621.68.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Biden blocked the proposed sale of US Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel for US$14.9 billion, citing national security concerns. US Steel's shares dropped 6.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft shares gained 1.1 percent after the company said it would invest US$80 billion on AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol producers lost some ground after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said that alcoholic drinks should carry a label warning of cancer risks. Molson Coors and Brown Forman slid by 3.4 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. (Reuters)

    Dental clinics to amend booking system over no-shows

<img alt="The Department of Health says some people simply forgot to show up for their dental appointments or have other commitments. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786058_1_20250103214911.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities on Friday said an oversubscription arrangement for online public dental bookings and a waiting-list mechanism will be introduced next week in a bid to prevent no-shows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health earlier launched its online registration for public dental services in a bid to avoid residents queuing overnight, but some people failed to show up for the appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Upon initial enquiry, they said that they were unable to attend due to other commitments or had forgotten their appointment, while others said that they were unaware that the scope of the service was limited to emergency dental services," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 6, public dental clinics will "suitably increase the number of successful applicants to a level exceeding the actual service quotas", and introduce a waiting list to fill possible vacancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who register successfully will be asked to confirm their attendance. If they are not able to do this, the slot will be assigned to someone on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those aged 65 or above who have registered but failed to secure a spot will be given priority on the waiting list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also said people allocated a spot must arrive at designated dental clinics by 8.30am on the day of the appointment. Staff members will begin reaching out to people on the waiting list to fill vacancies from 9.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the absence rate at each clinic, the [Department of Health] will suitably increase the quota of successful applicants and set up a waiting list to fill vacancies without compromising the overall quality of service, which remains the top priority," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Department of Health] will continue to monitor the operation of the new system and keep in view the utilisation and attendance rates. If the situation warrants, a mechanism to deter absenteeism and abuse may be introduced."

    US blocks Nippon Steel's bid to purchase US Steel

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for US Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly US$3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also represents the final chapter in a high profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up US Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they launched an investigation into a suspected murder case, after a man was found slashed in the back in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers received a report at about 10pm on Thursday saying a man was found lying unconscious outside the entrance of block seven at Po Tin Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, 33, was then rushed to Tuen Mun Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  After initial investigations, the force said they suspect the deceased was attacked by a man with a sharp object, and that he fled afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post-mortem examination will be conducted later to determine the cause of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said that a 44-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of misleading police officers during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Tuen Mun district crime squad are investigating the case, the force added.

 A fire and thick smoke engulfed an eight-story building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, sending 12 people to hospital with smoke inhalation, and about 30 people who had been trapped were safely rescued, the fire department said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department deployed 82 vehicles and equipment south of Seoul to bring the blaze under control after the fire started in a restaurant on the ground floor of the busy commercial building, which also housed a swimming pool where children take lessons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, YTN television reported multiple people were trapped inside, with footage showing black smoke engulfing a large part of the building. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos has removed Vice President Sara Duterte from the National Security Council, according to an executive order released on Friday, a month after she allegedly plotted to kill him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, signed on Monday by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, removed the vice president and all former presidents from the council which advises the president on policies affecting national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bersamin said the move was "to reorganise and streamline" its membership, which now comprises key legislative, defence, foreign and cabinet officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment, the VP is not considered relevant to the responsibilities of membership in the NSC," Bersamin told reporters, adding that the president was free to add other members or advisers as needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as Duterte is facing an investigation over her alleged threat to kill Marcos and his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In late November, Sara -- the 46-year-old daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte -- delivered an expletive-laden online news conference in which she claimed to have told someone to kill Marcos if she was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said the comments were misinterpreted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president swept to power in 2022 in an alliance with Marcos that has unravelled spectacularly in recent months, with both sides trading allegations of drug addiction and extreme rhetoric ahead of this year's mid-term elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte is also subject of multiple impeachment complaints over her alleged misuse of millions of dollars in government funds. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon have vowed to address issues raised by runners in the inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  The race, which has been designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics, will see 8,000 runners traversing the 55-kilometre bridge's Hong Kong stretch on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some participants of the event's first edition, which took place in November 2023, were left frustrated by a lack of sports drinks and snacks, as well as a shortage of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have increased the number of portable toilets. We have prepared 70 of them at the start and finish line, and we have 130 in total along the entire course... We believe this should be able to address the needs of runners," said Simon Yeung, who chairs the organising committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have responded to the issues raised by some runners. We heard them and have followed up, and we hope to do better this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said some of the six water stations would provide sports drinks and bananas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be divided into the "challenge" and "non-challenge" groups, with the first batch of runners expected to start at 7.15am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among participants in the "challenge" group will be 16 runners specially invited from abroad, including Ethiopian track and field athlete Milkesa Mengesha, who won the latest Berlin Marathon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of the bridge will be gradually closed to traffic from Saturday until after all races are completed.

 A rugby competition on Sunday will serve as the first test event at Kai Tak Stadium, paving the way for the Hong Kong Sevens in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong China Rugby will be hosting the concluding day of the University Sports Federation of Hong Kong, China’s rugby sevens tournament, which features 17 men's and women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first match is scheduled to kick off at 11.15am, with the final expected to conclude at 6.30pm. Ticket holders can enter the venue as early as 10am, but there will be no on-site ticket sales on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said the event will test various things needed for the Hong Kong Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our event operations team is obviously very experienced in running the main events, but here in particular, having the first opportunity to test, for instance, the full event control room in terms of the stadium operations, the media centre being open, broadcast teams, getting a look around the stadium," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of some of our entertainment, some of our sport experiences and entertainments that we're looking at for the main event. We'll have the opportunity to test and plan some of these event presentations. Equally we'll bring in some of our DJ and match announcers for the event which allows  us to test some of the sound systems that are used."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi anticipates around 10,000 spectators for the test event, saying it will be the first of many at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure has by and large been completed and every little part of the operations has been tested. What's more important is that... we put together every element into practice, into one single event so that we can have a certainty or we can have a more realistic test on the performance when all these elements are put together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be progressively increasing the complications, the scale, as well as the number of spectators of all of our test events."

    Mission to arrest President Yoon stalled: officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday called off their attempt to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol over his failed martial law bid because of a standoff at his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the execution of the arrest warrant today, it was determined that the execution was effectively impossible due to the ongoing standoff. Concern for the safety of personnel on-site led to the decision to halt the execution," the Corruption Investigation Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he is known to have left the residence was on December 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on December 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on December 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence. (Agencies)

    Officials mull mass transit station in Lam Tin North

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials are considering adding a ninth station to a planned elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, to serve people living in the northern part of Lam Tin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, which is expected to be completed in 2033, will run from Choi Hung East to Yau Tong East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Secretary Mable Chan told the Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers in an interview published on Friday that the route could be changed to enable the creation of a "Lam Tin North Station".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lam Tin to Yau Tong route would require extensive excavation through mountains and rocks to build a very long tunnel, which would be both complex and costly. Many Lam Tin residents would be unable to benefit from the system," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we found that shifting the route slightly leftward would bring it closer to the Lam Tin North area, where three housing estates with over 30,000 residents are located. We have identified potential locations in this area to build a station."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the first of the city's new taxi fleets could start running from March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five fleet licences have been granted as part of efforts to improve the sector's service quality.

    'Dental patients arriving earlier can tackle no-shows'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Friday suggested that public dental clinics should require patients to arrive at least an hour in advance to deal with no-shows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health launched its online registration for public dental services on Monday in a bid to avoid residents queuing overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 151 slots available, it recorded an overall absentee rate of 26.5 percent during the first two working days since the service was launched.
  <br>
  <br>
  A majority of them were residents aged 65 or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it would keep monitoring the operation and effectiveness of the new system and carry out suitable remedial measures, such as setting up a waiting list mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Hoi-yan said patients might not show up due to various reasons, including illness or they simply forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that - for instance - we can ask them to come in for registration an hour or so before the appointment. I think the public understands that the government has tried its best to avoid long queues," she told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coming in earlier to make sure you'll show up enables medical workers, or the Department of Health, to contact people on the waiting list and ask them to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said absentees should not be penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Tsuen Wan District Councillor Ng Chun-yu suggested that officials should also phone elderly patients to notify them they have been allocated a spot at a public dental clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The no-show rate at the Tsuen Wan clinic was 33.3 percent - the highest among all surveyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng suspected this was because some older people living outside the area were reluctant to travel a long distance for dental appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from notifying elderly by SMS, the government could also use pre-recorded phone calls and can call the elderly twice," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they don't pick up both calls, then it's likely that they won't show up, right? If half of the 40 people who've been allocated a slot aren't picking up the phone, maybe there's a high number of people not showing up? At least [health workers] can be prepared."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to media enquiries, the health department said some patients did not show up due to other engagements, or they forgot about the appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that some residents were not aware that the clinics only provide emergency dental services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian Authority (PA) has ordered the suspension of broadcasts by Al Jazeera in a move the Qatar-based television network condemned on Thursday as reminiscent of Israeli practices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera is already banned from broadcasting from Israel amid a long-running feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, masked Israeli troops raided the Al Jazeera office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority, to issue an initial 45-day closure order, in a move the PA foreign ministry slammed as "a flagrant violation" of press freedom at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the PA insisted its own suspension order was "temporary", adding its decision followed a complaint from the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate about the network's coverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These measures shall be applied until Al Jazeera chooses to act in accordance with basic media ethics, including its duty to prevent deliberate disinformation, ban the glorification of violence and end the incitement to armed mutiny," the PA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The syndicate, which represents about 3,000 Palestinian journalists, said several had filed complaints against Al Jazeera for "biased media coverage on its platforms, including incitement, misleading reports and content that stirs internal discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspension order involves "temporarily freezing the work of all journalists, employees, crews and affiliated channels until their legal status is rectified", the official news agency Wafa reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera aired images of what appeared to be Palestinian security officers entering the network's office in Ramallah and handing over the suspension order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The network condemned the decision, saying it "aligns with Israeli occupation practices targeting its media teams".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban on Al-Jazeera drew condemnation from press freedom organisations and the UN human rights office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militant group Hamas, rivals of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement which dominates the PA, said the ban went against Palestinian interests. (AFP)

    Israeli air strike hits a Gaza humanitarian zone

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people, including several children, across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, hitting Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the daily bombardment continued, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he had authorised a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar toward a ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli media said the delegation would depart on Friday. There was no immediate Hamas comment. The US-led talks have repeatedly stalled during 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike in the seaside humanitarian zone known as Muwasi occurred as hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians had been huddling there in damp winter weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s military said it targeted a senior police officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Israeli strike killed at least eight people in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The men were members of local committees that help secure aid convoys, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  In southern Gaza, the military killed five policemen in eastern Khan Younis. Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said the strike targeted the head of the Hamas internal security force in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war was sparked by Hamas-led militants’ October 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel’s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally. (AP)

    Biggest trackway of dinosaur footprints found in UK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers have uncovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints dating back to the middle Jurassic era in a quarry in Oxfordshire, southern England, showing that reptiles - such as the nine-metre predator Megalosaurus - moved along enormous tracks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dig at Dewars Farm Quarry found five extensive trackways, one of which measured more than 150 metres in length, researchers from the Universities of Oxford and Birmingham said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four of the tracks were made by gigantic, long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs called sauropods, most likely to be Cetiosaurus, an up to 18-metre-long cousin of the well-known Diplodocus, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth trackway was made by the carnivorous theropod dinosaur Megalosaurus, which had distinctive three-toed feet with claws.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carnivore and herbivore tracks, which are about 166 million-years-old, cross over at one point, raising questions about whether and how the two types of dinosaur were interacting, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named and described in 1824, kick-starting the last 200 years of dinosaur science and public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Nicholls, vertebrate palaeontologist ay the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, said: "Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found."
  <br>
  <br>
  The buried prints came to light when quarry worker Gary Johnson felt "unusual bumps" as he was stripping the clay back with his vehicle in order to expose the quarry floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 researchers then excavated in the site in June, where they found around 200 footprints, the universities said in a statement. (Reuters)

    FBI says driver in New Orleans rampage acted alone

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Army veteran who drove a truck into a crowd of New Year’s revellers in New Orleans acted alone, the FBI said on Thursday, reversing its position from a day earlier that he likely worked with others in the deadly attack that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State group.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FBI also revealed that the driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in the hours before the attack in which he proclaimed his support for the militant group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,” said Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, calling Jabbar “100 per cent inspired” by the Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack along Bourbon Street killed 14 revellers, along with Jabbar, 42, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and ploughing into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raia stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion on Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck filled with explosives outside Trump’s Las Vegas hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person inside that truck, a decorated US Army Green Beret, shot himself in the head just before detonation, authorities said. (AP)

    South Korean authorities move to arrest President Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators on Friday were attempting to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law decree last month, as hundreds of his supporters gathered near his residence in Seoul, vowing to protect him.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 20 investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police officers were seen entering the gate of Yoon’s residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  It wasn’t clear whether the president would cooperate with authorities trying to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon in a defiant New Year’s message to conservative supporters rallying outside his residence said he would “fight to the end” against “anti-state forces.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have described the warrant to detain him as “invalid” and “illegal.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon’s detention on Tuesday after he evaded multiple requests to appear for questioning and blocked searches of his office in Seoul, hindering an investigation into whether his ill-conceived power grab on December 3 amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant is valid for one week, and investigators may make another attempt to detain Yoon if they are unable to do so on Friday. (AP)

    Antetokounmpo, Jokić lead early NBA All-Star voting

<img alt="Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo leads early NBA All-Star fan voting with 1.7 million votes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785956_2_20250103074152.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is the early leader in fan balloting for the NBA All-Star Game, and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers seems well on his way toward extending his record and getting picked for a 21st time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first update on All-Star voting for this season's revised game was released saw Antetokounmpo as the overall leader with about 1.7 million votes. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokić of the Denver Nuggets is second overall with about 1.4 million votes, which tops all Western Conference players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball led East guards with 947,444 votes, with Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell second on 718,084 and Milwaukee's Damian Lillard third on 704,914.
  <br>
  <br>
  There won't be ten starters this year for the All-Star Game, which is set to take place on Febuary 16 in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  2025 marks the first year of a new All-Star format, one where there will be three games. The 24 All-Stars will be drafted into three teams of eight players apiece by TNT personalities and former NBA greats Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams will be entered into a four-team tournament, with the remaining squad being the team of NBA rookies and second-year players that wins the Rising Stars event on All-Star Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are two semifinal games, followed by the winners meeting in a championship game – with the first team to reach 40 points the winner of all three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be wildly different than last year, when the All-Star Game final score was 211-186 – the highest-scoring one in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voting continues through January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan voting makes up 50 percent of the All-Star starter selection formula, with media voting accounting for another 25 percent and voting by current NBA players counting for the remaining 25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ten players designated as starters – even though there technically will be at least 15 starters in the All-Star “games” – will be announced on January 23, and the reserves that will be selected by NBA head coaches will be announced on January 30. (AP/AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street closed lower as investors weighed up their best strategy to deal with a strong US dollar and labour market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785945_1_20250103052420.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street see-sawed to a lower close on Thursday amid choppy trading, as investors tackled the new year having to contend with a strong labour market, a rising dollar and tumbling Tesla shares.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US stocks ended the session in negative territory, a reversal of an earlier rally but off session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some macro news but somewhat mixed and you know we have a very strong dollar today," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "There are a few hurdles over the next couple of weeks and those are next Friday’s employment data and the beginning of fourth quarter earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, we’re looking at choppiness and a struggle for direction until we get those hurdles out of the way," Cardillo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla sank after reporting its first annual drop in deliveries, as incentives failed to stem a decline in demand for its ageing line-up of electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report from the Labor Department showed initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits both fell last week, supporting the narrative of a solid jobs market and adding weight to the possibility that the US central bank could let its key interest rate stand at this month's policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking past uncertainties regarding the pace of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, policies to be enacted by the incoming Donald Trump administration and various hot spots of geopolitical unrest, market participants chose to focus on the strength of the United States economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes notched double-digit gains in 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 recording its best two-year run since 1997-1998. Those gains were driven by the US Federal Reserve's first rate cuts in three-and-a-half years, the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and expectations of pro-business policies from the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally lost steam in the closing weeks of 2024, with the S&P 500 and the Dow marking declines for December, as markets priced in the likelihood of fewer rate cuts from the Fed this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 13.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,868.56 points, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 30.00 points, or 0.16 percent, to 19,280.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 42,392.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P and the Nasdaq have now posted five consecutive sessions in the red, their longest losing streak since mid-April.

 Andrey Rublev's Australian Open preparations took an unexpected hit as the top seed was dumped out of the Hong Kong Open in the second round by Fabian Marozsan on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the first Grand Slam of the year just over a week away, the Hungarian ranked 58th in the world won 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old faces China's Shang Juncheng, 19, in the last eight at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian Rublev, ranked eighth, was the defending Hong Kong champion and had been pursuing a 76th tour-level quarter-final.
  <br>

  There was no such trouble for second seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, who defeated Canadian qualifier Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-3.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan (US$68.5) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-day promotion, running from January 4 to 7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3 percent during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42 percent, according to research firm IDC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has apologised over the suspected theft of files that contained the personal data of about 100 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the incident involved two internal document files stored at the Kowloon City District Environmental Hygiene Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEHD said the files contained records of public complaints against environmental nuisances in the district, including the names and contact information of about 100 complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has reported the case to the police and notified the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data as well as affected complainants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the case is believed to be an isolated incident, the department will take stringent action should the investigation reveal any negligence or mishandling by any officer," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FEHD will also review the current personal data security measures to ensure effective protection of the personal data it collects."

 China has added 28 US entities to its export control list to "safeguard national security and interests", the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The companies on the list include General Dynamics, Boeing Defence, Space & Security, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles & Defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is also banning the export of dual-use items to these companies starting on Thursday, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the ministry said on Thursday it had added 10 US companies to its "Unreliable Entity List" for their involvement in arms sales to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective from Thursday, the blacklisted companies, which include various units of Lockheed and General Dynamics, will be banned from exporting to and importing from China or making new investments in the country, according to the ministry. (Reuters)

<img alt="Retail sales have declined for nine months in a row. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785893_2_20250102183155.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A gunman who fatally shot at least 12 people, including two children, in Montenegro has killed himself while surrounded by police, officials said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinović, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, Interior Minister Danilo Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacker, who was fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometres northwest of the capital, Podgorica.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the roads in and out of the city were blocked as police swarmed the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Šaranović said that Martinović had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the “severity of his injuries.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, with Prime Minister Milojko Spajić describing the shooting as a “terrible tragedy.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The level of rage and brutality shows that sometimes such people ... are even more dangerous than members of organized criminal gangs,” Šaranović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinović was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted, Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović said. He said that Martinović then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He killed four people” at the bar before heading out, and then continued shooting at three more locations, Šćepanović said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the suspect received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behaviour and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behaviour. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Toys and Games Fair, together with two other fairs, will kick off on Monday, featuring more eco-friendly products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Toys and Games Fair, the Baby Products Fair and the International Stationery and School Supplies Fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from January 6 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which is the main organiser, said the three fairs, themed “New Play for All”, attracted more than 2,500 exhibitors from different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKTDC’s deputy executive director Sophia Chong said the Green Toys Zone will return for a second year, featuring toys made with eco-friendly or recycled materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the fair will also present the first ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Pavilion, as going green is a global trend.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The materials, the production process and also the standard of entering these import markets outside of Hong Kong, are placing more and more importance on environmentally friendly requirements and standards,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not only applying in the toys and games and baby product sectors, but also across sectors in the fashion, lifestyle, as well as the electronics industry, so we think this will be a definite worldwide trend which cannot be missed.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said green toys include plush dog toys made using eco-friendly materials, and 3D paper puzzles made with pure wood pulp kraft paper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s economy this year, saying the HKTDC planned to organise about 40 large-scale fairs and conventions in 2025.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department has announced that authorities are now handling up to 500 applications each working day from car owners who want to drive to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, up from 400 previously.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said the move will allow it to better cope with the number of applications being received under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eligibility, procedures and balloting of applications of the scheme remain unchanged," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the operation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and maintain close liaison with relevant departments to review and enhance the arrangements of the scheme in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme began in June 2023 and more than 60,000 applications had been submitted by the middle of last year.

 The chief executive of South Korean airline Jeju Air has been banned from leaving the country, police said on Thursday, after one of the company's Boeing 737-800 planes crashed last week killing 179.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The investigation team imposed a travel ban on two individuals, including Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae," said police in South Jeolla Province, where the crash in Muan city happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, police on Thursday raided the offices of Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of the probe into the fatal crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before slamming into a barrier, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities carried out search and seizure operations at the Muan airport where flight 2216 crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing the crash site since the disaster to establish a cause, with both black boxes found and decoding work ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In relation to the plane accident... a search and seizure operation is being conducted…at three locations," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police plan to swiftly and rigorously determine the cause and responsibility for this accident in accordance with the law and principles."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported a search warrant was approved on charges of professional negligence resulting in death, citing officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has also announced it will inspect all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by its carriers, focusing on the landing gear, which appears to have malfunctioned during the Sunday crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said on Thursday that "immediate action" must be taken if that probe uncovered any issues with the aircraft model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have previously said 101 aircraft of the same model were in operation by six different airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant agencies must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If any issues are found during the inspection, please take immediate corrective action," he added. (AFP)

    Cage homes won't be under new regulations: Winnie Ho

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials would implement new regulations over future basic housing units with care. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785862_1_20250102132347.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Thursday said the government was not including cage homes and cubicle units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, because those are already subject to an existing licensing system.
 <br>
  <br>
  There have been calls for the government to put these so-called bed space units under the future basic housing unit regime, which would subject flats to requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the housing chief said there's a public misconception about this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Bed space' units in various forms – including 'cage homes', 'coffin homes' and 'space capsule' units – are already regulated by the licensing regime under the Bedspace Apartments Ordinance," Ho wrote in an SCMP opinion piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulation under the regime for basic housing units would only duplicate regulations and is therefore unnecessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the government estimates that around 80,000 basic housing units would still be available in the market after the new laws are introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coupled with the fact that more public housing will be available in the coming years, she said there shouldn't be much room for rents to rise significantly for subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that as tackling subdivided flats is her bureau's top priority, the government is striving to pass legal changes by the end of the year and would then implement new regulations in a gradual and careful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords would be given up to a year and a half to register the flats, followed by a grace period of up to two years for working things out with tenants before flat conversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said after the completion of registration, officials would decide on the time frame for law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said enforcement would be carried out in an orderly manner, to avoid displacing affected households.

    HK breast milk bank to commence operations on Jan 6

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's first breast milk bank – located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay – will start services on January 6, the Hospital Authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, the director of the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank, Rosanna Wong, said the facility aims to collect 50 to 100 litres of breast milk in its first stage of service, so it can start supplying the milk to premature or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals in March when the second stage begins.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will ensure the quality of the breast milk. We will conduct checks including screening, microbiological testing, pasteurisation, and nutritional analysis, all under precise temperature control. The processed breast milk will then be eligible to supply to the newborns,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said breast milk is easier for premature newborns to digest, and can reduce the chance of them developing complications due to their early birth.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the bank could collect around 1,000 litres of breast milk a year in future, benefiting 450 to 600 newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  To donate breast milk, Wong said the donor must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and is currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donor will also have to take a blood test once every three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the facility will provide milk bottles and pouches to the donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donors can store their breast milk in a refrigerator at home before a courier arranged by the facility collects the milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Breastfeeding Mothers’ Association welcomed the launch of the facility, with chairwoman Jacy Chan calling it "a good start".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very helpful for premature or critically-ill newborns because often mothers cannot breastfeed them because of the separation, so having donated breast milk to help these babies would be very good to help with their recovery," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said many women are interested in donating breast milk, so it's important to make things easier for prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For mothers who are giving birth or have given birth at private hospitals, they have to go to the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, so it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes for these mothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, the questionnaire and the blood test used to be done from Monday to Thursday during working hours, which means I think for mothers on maternity leave it may not be as difficult, but for mothers who have returned to work it would mean they have to take a day off to go to the place specifically for this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they can have a bit more different points for which the mothers can do the blood test, that would be helpful."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who has been charged with murder and attempted robbery, in connection with an incident in Sham Shui Po more than three decades ago, appeared in Eastern Court on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wen Wenye, 59, was arrested last November when he entered Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is alleged to be one of three people who robbed a second-hand watch store on Pei Ho Street before fleeing in a car in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 56-year-old male shopkeeper died after being shot in the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Magistrates’ Court has adjourned the case pending transfer to the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was again remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for the two other suspects.

<img alt="Professor Vivian Lou (right) says Hong Kong has to review some of its policies to better cater for the needs of those living alone. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785831_1_20250102095045.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts have called for more support measures to cope with the rising trend of single-person households in Hong Kong, with reviews on existing policies to better cater for their needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of one-person households in the SAR rose from around 13 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Lou, professor of social work and social administration at the University of Hong Kong, said society had generally become more accepting towards those living alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our policies, programmes, and economic activities are not biased towards multi-persons families. If you are single, you can still enjoy, participate and contribute," she said on the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For part of the policies or care systems, we do need to critically review and identify the blocks; what blocks the one-person households from enjoying, asserting their choices, and participating wholly in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Srinivas Tata, the social development division director of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said single-person households mostly consisted of two groups of people – young people and elderly individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said support was needed to prevent singletons, in particular those from the older generation, suffering from emotional distress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes the prescriptions are social prescriptions. It means more interactions, it means more emotional support, it means having the opportunity to interact with people," Tata said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Promoting intergenerational interactions and government policies for children to support parents are key to strengthening support for those living alone, Tata added.

    Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine ends

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785829_1_20250102094332.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)
