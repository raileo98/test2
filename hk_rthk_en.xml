<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen's hopes of clinching a fourth consecutive drivers' world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend took a dent on Friday when Red Bull revealed they had brought the wrong rear wing.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Auto Motor und Sport, the team's senior advisor Helmut Marko said Red Bull were losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight, the Las Vegas Boulevard leading to Caesars Palace, after a packing blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have another rear wing, a smaller rear wing, as we see on our competitors," said Marko. "It would be more helpful, for sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it was too late for the team to arrange for a more appropriate trimmed rear wing to be flown out to Las Vegas before the race on Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen leads McLaren's Lando Norris by 62 points with three races remaining and simply needs to finish ahead of him in Las Vegas to become the sixth man to win four world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, however, struggled in second practice on Thursday night, finishing 17th in slippery conditions on the cold, dry and dusty circuit around the streets of 'Sin City' where the three-time champion won last year's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen tried to make light of the team's error, in packing the wrong rear wing, and blamed his struggle on the slippery conditions and difficulty with tyre temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The issue for us is definitely tyre-related as we have no grip and it feels like driving on ice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We struggled to make the tyres work, especially over one lap and we were quite far off with the pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team-mate Sergio Perez was 19th in the session topped by Mercedes' seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of Norris of McLaren, who said on Wednesday it is "probably too late" to stop Verstappen from taking the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were flashes of speed," said Marko. "We just have to get consistency into it. On the single lap we can improve but on the long run, the tyre wear is a problem at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that conditions may change in favour of Red Bull before the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow is a different day," he said. "You see it a lot of times. People will be fastest on Friday, or Thursday, but it doesn't mean that they are fast in the race. We will, for sure, make a reasonable step." (AFP)

    COP29 draft proposes rich nations pay US$250bn a year

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell on Friday shot a five-under 65 to surge to the top of the leaderboard at the Hong Kong Open, putting the defending champion one shot ahead of Thailand's Nitithorn Thippong as the competition entered the halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a dominant display for Campbell, 33, who took advantage of his familiarity with the course in Fanling to outperform his group comprising South Korean phenom Tom Kim and American Peter Uihlein under sunny and bright conditions, a far-cry from Thursday's wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell had a two-day total of 12-under 128, overtaking opening round leader Nitithorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – Australian Kevin Yuan, Kazuki Higa of Japan and Yongjun Bae of South Korea, who had the day's best score of 62 – were tied for third at 9-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho moved up the leaderboard in his bid to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China star had another solid outing with a round of five-under 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho and four others were tied for sixth at eight under at the end of round two, four shots behind Campbell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim and Uihlein, meanwhile, were among those missing the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today gave me a lot of confidence and proved what I was doing was working," Campbell told reporters after his strong performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think being out on LIV as a reserve this year really helped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being around some of the best players in the world, seeing what they do, allowed me to back up the things I've learned from the team around me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell also spoke about what it meant to be competing in the SAR again, as he looks to defend his title and add a second Asian Tour title to his resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've found a swing that my body seems to like a lot more," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning here last year was massive. It's always nice to come back to a golf course you really like and feel comfortable on, so it's definitely great to be back here again."

    Improving governance and accountability a priority: HA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's hospital bosses have vowed to clarify the responsibility of staff of all ranks and strengthen accountability of senior management when it comes to medical incidents, after a review committee found the roles of workers are not clearly established.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instructed by the administration following a string of medial blunders, the Hospital Authority (HA) set up a review committee a few months ago to look into the operations and management of public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among 31 recommendations put forward to the authority, the review committee suggested public hospitals enhance top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as define the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it would look into introducing a reward-and-penalty system when assessing staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important to more clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each of the staff at different levels," said HA chief executive Tony Ko on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee also recommend that in terms of the performance assessment of individual staff, we have to put into elements of quality and safety. So we'll be more explicit in terms of the performance assessment of the individual staff to see how they can reflect in part of the performance and obviously subsequently will be related to the accountability issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  The review committee noted that junior hospital staff often have a strong sense of hierarchy, stopping them from speaking up even when they spotted problems before incidents eventually happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Younger and less experienced staff members lacked enough training and were not too familiar with safety culture, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A high-level reform committee, to be led by HA chairman Henry Fan, will be formed. The permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the group will focus solely on improving governance and accountability, while other issues would be worked on as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, having said that, there are some issues, for example the recommendation that we should change the culture of HA, which would probably take some time," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Culture, by definition, is deep-rooted, and we can't expect to change that overnight. So we will do our best. But what we want is to try to make changes as quickly as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include strengthening clinical mentorship and supervision, and encouraging staff to report incidents.

    Bus fare increase requests opposed by lawmakers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some lawmakers attending a Legco transport panel meeting on Friday voiced their opposition to fare increase applications made by franchised bus operators.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New Lantao Bus want to put fares up by 6.5 percent, while Citybus is seeking 9.5 percent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB told lawmakers it needs to charge more because the expansion of the MTR network is having an "irreversible" impact on its finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's finance director, Joseph Leung, said average daily passenger numbers are down nine percent compared to 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is due to changes in economic cycle, ageing population, as well as a change in people's commuting patterns, and people are going out less during weekends and at night," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing an expansion of the railway system, including the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line. We see a loss of 130,000 passengers every day. The further expansion of the railway system will hit the bus operators and these conditions are irreversible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang was among those criticising the fare increase applications. But he backed a Citybus plan to roll out a loyalty programme for customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes it will cover journeys between Tin Shui Wai and Hong Kong Island as bus fares are more expensive than the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for journeys from Tin Shui Wai North to Hong Kong Island, actually Citybus has the advantage. Because compared to the railway, Citybus routes are faster and more convenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the problem is that these routes are too expensive even when passengers interchange to trains. Therefore, if there are such loyalty programmes, I believe it will encourage commuters to choose to take buses."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said China is ready to engage in dialogue and manage differences with the United States to promote steady and sustained development of bilateral economic ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's also the China International Trade Representative, told a press conference on Friday that the world's two-largest economies are highly complementary as he emphasised the importance of their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to a reporter's question about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose 60 percent tariffs on imports from China, he said that would "not solve the country’s own trade deficit problem”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it leads to higher prices for imported products and inflation, with the burden ultimately falling on consumers," Wang added.

  He noted that China's total foreign trade including imports and exports reached 36 trillion yuan in January-October, up about 5 percent from the same period of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Friday's press conference, Wang and other officials outlined ways that China is promoting expanding trade and support for coping with climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such measures include streamlining customs and visa requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  China allows visa-free travel for citizens of 29 countries, including France and Germany, and the number of foreign visitors, which plunged during the pandemic, has jumped this year. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country's biggest internet forum concluded its four-day session in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Friday, with more than 1,800 guests from over 130 countries taking part.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech representatives and government ministers meet annually in the town for the World Internet Conference, which focused this year on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the conference, the World Internet Development report 2024 was issued, reviewing China’s internet development over the past three decades and projecting future directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the evolution of global cyberspace governance and stressed the need for international consensus on AI and data issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some attendees about what they hoped the summit will achieve.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the participants, City University’s deputy president Ray Cheung, said he wants more teaching collaboration within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “City University already established our Dongguan campus and 80 percent of the faculty that are teaching courses in Dongguan is actually coming from Hong Kong. So what we are seeing is a lot of synergies actually developing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we see Hong Kong as the global international education hub is taking a very important role for the GBA as well as the global education development.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Stanford neuroscientist and researcher Walter Greenleaf, said he hope to see some agreements to address looming healthcare crises after the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned from the pandemic that what happens in one spot can impact another spot. So I think as healthcare providers, as developers of healthcare technology, we need to transcend borders and just make sure that we realise that as people, as part of the world, we are in a great position to help each other."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said global investors have confidence in Hong Kong, dismissing reports of capital moving out of the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum on wealth management, Chan highlighted Hong Kong's status as a well-established international financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fundamentals as an international financial centre have remained as strong as ever. Recently, Hong Kong returned to the top three global financial centres, along with New York and London," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet from time to time, we come across reports about Hong Kong, such as those on the outflow of funds. A few important facts will illustrate that international investors remain highly confident in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said Hong Kong's stock market has continued to grow, raising about HK$70 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that asset and wealth management companies have been expanding their businesses in Hong Kong, increasing office space rentals and relocating senior executives to the city.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is to set up a committee to reform its governance and structure after the government ordered a review of its management following a spate of medical blunders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said on Friday that the committee, to be formed under the HA's board, will be chaired by the authority's chairman, Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had been vetting a review report submitted over "systemic management issues" at the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health chief Lo Chung-mau said his bureau agreed with the directions set out in 31 recommendations for enhancing the HA's governance and structure to provide better and safer healthcare services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Henry Fan, being the reform committee chairman, is to steer the implementation of recommendations made in the review report regarding governance, accountability and distribution of responsibilities, and relevant reform work," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that the HA will have to submit regular progress reports to the government to ensure that enhancement measures are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

 Residents and tourists gathered at China Merchant Wharf  in Western on Friday to get a view of the People's Liberation Army Navy's assault ship the Hainan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vessel, along with the Changsha destroyer which was docked at Stonecutters Island, arrived in the city on Thursday morning for a five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the spectators told RTHK he was stunned by the Hainan's size.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve got time, and the ships are here, so I just came to see the country’s strengths. I think the country being strong can help balance the world,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangdong said she decided to visit the city after hearing news about the two vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These ships are great. They don’t come here often, and this time it is staying for five days, so I came to Hong Kong just to see the ship. Just looking at the ship is enough,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of activities will be held during the ships’ stay, including tours, cultural exchanges and talks on national defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier that people will be able to understand the nation’s achievements in defence and military modernisation if they join the activities.

    Cyberport ready for low-altitude flying tests: CEO

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyberport CEO Rocky Cheng said on Thursday that the park was well-positioned for low-altitude flying trials with its ample space and a pier, adding that there were plans to set up a landing port for test flights.
 <br>
  <br>
  As a venue partner for sandbox pilot projects for developing low-altitude economy, Cyberport will provide suitable locations and supporting facilities for drones and other aerial technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheng said the park had what it takes for low-altitude flight tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Cyberport's geographical environment is very suitable for conducting low-altitude economy trials. The new Phase 5 building, set to open in the third quarter of next year, offers a stunning sea view. There is also a 150-metre-long pier adjacent to the ocean, and ample space within Cyberport,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng outlined plans to set up a landing port at the pier and organise exhibitions on drones to educate the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the AI supercomputing centre due to start operation at the end of this year, Cheng said it was progressing well with some computing power already available for use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the centre hoped to start off by providing 1,300 petaflops of computing power, before bringing it up to 1,700 by next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government wants to develop and promote AI to help various industries in Hong Kong surpass other advanced economies, so this computing power serves as crucial infrastructure. We should see gradual increases in computing capacity in the future. I believe it will quickly exceed 10,000 petaflops,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrick Sin, who chairs the committee on a HK$3 billion subsidy scheme to help AI researchers and companies make the best use of Cyberport's computing power, said the project marked the start of a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I personally believe this is the opening of the AI era… So I think if more investment and more initiatives are provided by the government, I think that will give Hong Kong a further push to give more experts, professionals, to have more chance to exercise what they want to show to innovate and to benefit Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin added that the scheme, which opened for application in October, will favour firms that have expertise in research and development, and present innovative ideas that benefit the SAR.

 The MTR Corporation said on Friday that normal services are resuming on the East Rail line after an equipment fault on a train near University Station caused delays.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the train had been moved and services were returning to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The problem caused delays of up to fifteen minutes on the East Rail line between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honour on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, 30, was a unanimous MVP for the third time, receiving all 30 first-place votes and 420 points in voting by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points, and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVP's here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me – which I think he’ll do.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani was unanimously voted the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting. He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record US$700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first player to twice become an unanimous MVP. He combined with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023 for the first year both MVP's were unanimous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He helped the Dodgers to the World Series title, playing the final three games with a torn labrum in his left shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter to win an MVP. He joined Frank Robinson for Cincinnati in 1961 and Baltimore in 1966 as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds with seven and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout with three each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Balloting was conducted before the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. (AP)

 Red Bull Italy SailGP Team was on Thursday unveiled as the 12th and final entry for the 2025 SailGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Jimmy Spithill, who serves as the team's CEO and founder, the team will make its debut this weekend at the Emirates Dubai Sail Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian lineup includes double Olympic gold medallist Ruggero Tita as driver and twice world bronze medallist Giulia Fava as strategist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the team are three-time SailGP champion Kyle Langford, who made a surprise move from Australia, and grinders Matteo Celon and Enrico Voltolini, both veterans of America’s Cup racing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s debut comes after Spithill announced plans to form an Italian team following his departure from the US SailGP Team last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is one of two new entries in the global league this season, alongside the Mubadala Brazil SailGP Team.
  <br>
  <br>
  SailGP is an international sailing competition featuring high-speed races in identical F50 foiling catamarans, capable of reaching speeds exceeding 100 km/h.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league pits national teams against each other in a series of regattas held across iconic locations worldwide. (Reuters)

<img alt="Italy's Jannik Sinner and Matteo Berrettini after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780327_1_20241122080813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Jannik Sinner triumphed in singles and doubles to help Davis Cup holders Italy beat Argentina 2-1 on Thursday to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italy will face Australia after they earlier defeated record 32-time winners the United States with a tense 2-1 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first two Grand Slams this season, as well as triumphing at the ATP Finals last week without dropping a set, and blew Sebastian Baez away 6-2, 6-1 after Francisco Cerundolo comfortably beat Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 in the opening rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decisive doubles battle, Sinner and Matteo Berrettini shaded Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez 6-4, 7-5 to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they put me on the court in doubles I try my best," said Sinner. "Matteo played unbelievable today, he carried me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy booked a third consecutive return to the semi-finals and are favourites to win the Davis Cup for a second year running, in no small part because of Sinner's presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old is still waiting for the outcome of the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner beat Novak Djokovic in singles and doubles in last year's semi-finals on the way to helping Italy end a 47-year wait to lift the trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't have time to adapt to this court after the ATP Finals, so I'm very happy with how I handled the situation today," Sinner told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very good doubles pairing, he played unbelievable," he added. "I tried to stay there with Berrettini, he also gave me a lot of confidence to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  The doubles teams were tied until the ninth game of the first set when Sinner won three points and then Molteni clipped his passing shot which was heading wide to hand Italy the decisive solitary break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set was even tighter with Italy breaking for a 6-5 lead and sealing their victory with a Sinner smash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini more than held his own alongside Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're playing with Jannik the pressure is off a little bit, he's going to play great," said the world number 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's captain Guillermo Coria said he was pleased with his team taking Italy to the wire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It speaks of the respect Italy have for us, and my doubles pairing, that they put the world number one out there," he said. "We were close to taking out a powerful team like Italy." (AFP)

    Australian teen dies from suspected methanol poisoning

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian teenager died on Thursday after drinking alcohol contaminated with methanol in Laos, Thai police and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, the fourth foreign national now suspected to have died in the incident.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bianca Jones, 19, fell ill last week in Vang Vieng, a town in the Southeast Asian nation popular with foreign backpackers that is about two hours north of the capital Vientiane by road.
  <br>
  <br>
  She died on Thursday after being taken to a hospital in neighbouring Thailand on November 13, police in the city of Udon Thani said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The physician who examined her said the cause of death was a methanol poisoning, from fake liquor," Phattanawong Chanphon, a police official in the Thai city, told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of methanol in her body was high, leading to swelling of the brain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian media said Jones was the fourth foreign tourist to die after consuming the contaminated alcohol, following two Danes and an American.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure," Albanese told parliament on Thursday. "All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones' friend Holly Bowles, also 19, is in critical condition and on life support, her father Shaun Bowles told reporters outside Bangkok Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurious liquor is a problem in Laos, with the governments of Australia and Britain warning citizens to be cautious when taking drinks there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Methanol is a toxic alcohol that is used industrially as a solvent, pesticide, and alternative fuel source, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowles and Jones stayed at the Nana Backpackers Hostel in Vang Vieng last week and drank at the hostel’s bar before they went out for the evening, Australian media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  They failed to check out on November 13, when hostel staff rushed the pair to the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vietnamese manager of the hostel has been detained for questioning, the Laos tourist police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No charges have been made, however, as police are still "investigating," an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. (Agencies)

    Duct-taped banana sells for US$6.2m at auction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for US$6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Comedian," by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on art collectors. At one point, performance artist David Datuna took the banana off the wall and ate it, saying he felt "hungry" while inspecting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between US$120,000 and US$150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece attracted  attention at the auction at Sotheby's, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana, which was bought from a Bangladeshi fruit seller on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to The New York Times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bidding started at US$800,000 and within minutes shot up to US$2 million, then US$3 million, then $4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked "Don't let it slip away."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Don’t miss this opportunity," Barker said. "These are words I've never thought I'd say: Five million dollars for a banana."
  <br>
  <br>
  The final hammer price announced in the room was US$5.2 million, which did not include the about US$1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sun said the piece "represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community". But he said the latest version of "Comedian" will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sotheby’s calls Cattelan "among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways," the auction house said in a description of "Comedian".
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for other works such as a golden toilet called "America", Cattelan has explained the banana work as a critical commentary on the art market, which he has criticised in the past for being speculative and failing to help artists. (AP/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The major US  indexes closed higher after choppy trading on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 hitting one-week high.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dow Jones Industrial Average gains were aided by cloud company Salesforce's advances after three brokerages lifted their price targets on the stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Wall Street's biggest company, Nvidia, were up after initially choppy trading following its earnings release on Wednesday. The chip company surpassed expectations for quarterly results, and projected fourth-quarter revenue above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Nvidia's] earnings report was really, really good. Some of the whisper numbers were higher and they disappointed there, but the fundamentals of AI and Nvidia continue to fire on all cylinders and the outlook for next year is positive," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 percent to 43,870.35, the S&P 500 gained 0.53 percent to 5,948.49 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up fractionally to end barely changed at 18,972.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alphabet slid to touch a four-week low after the Justice Department argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its monopoly on online search.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock's losses weighed on the communication services sector, which was a drag on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com fell after a report said it will likely face an EU investigation next year into whether it favours its own brand products on its online marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the data front, a weekly report on jobless claims showed they fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from Federal Reserve officials before the mid-December FOMC meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Money-market bets point to a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ve moved on from the election a bit, we got the Nvidia report, so the next thing markets will look for is the Fed meeting, and some policy speak from Fed officials this week have pointed to maybe a pause in the making for December," Saglimbene said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said the United States is more vulnerable to inflationary shocks than in the past, according to a media report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he supports further interest rate cuts and is open to doing them more slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders also monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia that sent crude prices higher and aided a gain in the energy sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of machinery manufacturer Deere gained after reporting an upbeat fourth-quarter profit, while AI company Snowflake jumped after raising its annual product revenue forecast. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has extended a warm welcome to two of the country’s navy vessels - a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship - that are making a port visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday, the arrival of The Changsha and The Hainan was greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, Lee said a slew of activities have been arranged during their five-day visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes Hongkongers can take the opportunity to experience the country’s achievements in national defence and military modernisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Crew members will take part in activities with local people and the SAR garrison. I believe this will raise awareness here of the nation's achievements in naval construction and development, while strengthening a sense of national identity and pride, especially among the younger generation,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of mainland officials were also present at the welcoming ceremony, including Vice Admiral Wei Wenhui, deputy commander of the Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as director of the liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong.

 The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim Al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court said on Thursday.

  In their decision to grant the warrants, the ICC judges said there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for starvation in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The warrant for Al-Masri lists charges of mass killings during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, including rape and the taking of hostages. The prosecution indicated it would continue to gather information with respect to his reported death.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced on May 20 that he was seeking arrest warrants for alleged crimes connected to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel and the Israeli military response in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Israel has said it killed Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, in an airstrike but Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied this.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett said the ICC's decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant were a "mark of shame" for the court. Israel's main opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the court's move, calling it "a reward for terrorism".
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Netanyahu or Gallant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court does not have its own police force to carry out arrests and relies on its member states for that. ICC members include all European Union countries, Britain, Japan, Brazil, Australia and Canada, and in the Middle East region the Palestinian territories and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC said Israel's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction was not required. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos under its global anti-corruption sanctions regime, the British government said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos, whose father Jose Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years until 2017, has faced corruption accusations in Angola and elsewhere for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Africa's first female billionaire denies the allegations and says she is the target of a long-running political vendetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said dos Santos misappropriated more than 50 million pounds (US$63.19 million) for her own financial benefit while she run Angolan state oil firm Sonangol.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said she misappropriated more than 300 million pounds while she was director of telecoms company Unitel .
  <br>
  <br>
  Dos Santos lost an appeal to overturn an order freezing up to 580 million pounds of her assets in September as part a lawsuit at London's High Court brought by Unitel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global police agency Interpol confirmed in 2022 it had issued a red notice for dos Santos, who says she lives in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British government has added seven other designations targeting other individuals under the same global anti-corruption case. (Reuters)

<img alt="Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780282_1_20241121191829.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Texas authorities have offered the incoming Trump administration land on the border with Mexico to build "deportation facilities" in support of the president-elect's plan for the mass removal of undocumented migrants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Incoming president Donald Trump said this week he planned to declare a national emergency on border security and use the US military to carry out the mass deportation of undocumented migrants after taking office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Texas General Land Office announced that commissioner Dawn Buckingham has offered him more than 1,400 acres (570 hectares) of public land on the US southern border "to aid his administration in carrying out their deportation plans".
  <br>
  <br>
  The plot of land is a ranch along the Rio Grande river -- serving as a border between the United States and Mexico -- in Starr county. It was acquired by the office in late October, the statement from the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter dated Tuesday, Buckingham said she had authorized a 1.5-mile easement on the ranch to allow "the Texas Border Wall to be built" after the land was acquired.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her office was "fully prepared" to work with US federal agencies to "allow a facility to be built for the processing, detention, and coordination of the largest deportation of violent criminals in the nation's history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump has repeatedly railed against undocumented migrants during the election campaign, blaming them for "poisoning the blood" of the country and highlighting violent crimes perpetrated by members of the migrant community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before his first term as president, he had pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, but the project was never completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said he would "marshal every lever of power to secure the border", according to US broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities estimate that about 11 million people are living in the United States illegally -- many fleeing violence or economic troubles in their countries and looking for a better life in America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's deportation plan is expected to impact around 20 million families. (AFP)

    Taichi Kho 'solid' as Thai star leads HK Open

<img alt="Taichi Kho says he got off to a slow start before playing better on day one of the Hong Kong Open. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780280_1_20241121190146.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local golfing sensation Taichi Kho said he had a "solid day" at the office as he shot a three-under 67 in the opening round of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  That put the Hong Kong, China star tied for 20th place, five shots off the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand led the pack at the end of day one with a sizzling round of eight-under 62.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appearing in his second Hong Kong Open, the 24-year-old Kho braved the rainy and windy conditions and teed off in a group comprising 2015 champion Justin Rose and American Patrick Reed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was a solid day overall," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Got off to a bit of a slow start, but I feel like Patrick [Reed] and Justin [Rose] were very encouraging of me to play well out there today, which allowed me to feed off of their energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learned a lot from how they played, which helped me get my momentum going midway through the round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the putts didn't quite drop, I still felt like I played well towards the end and did a lot of good things out there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho is bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open after his historic victory at the World City Championship last year made him the first Hong Kong player to win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand, along with Australian Kevin Yuan and Kazuki Higa of Japan, were a shot behind Nitithorn at seven under 63, tied for second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the other top finishers from the SAR, Jason Hak had a round of 66 and Michael Wong, like Kho, shot a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kho, the Hong Kong Open serves as a test match for the 2025 National Games, where he is set to compete in the event co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely want to represent Hong Kong, China," Kho said, as he weighed in on the opportunity to compete for the SAR on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This course has stood the test of time. It's one of the best ones we play out on tour, making it a great venue for the upcoming Games."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said its has finished installing platform screen doors at nine stations along the East Rail Line.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator said it expects to finish putting doors in at three more stations, Lo Wu, Mong Kok East and University Station, next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief engineering manager for system integration Maggie Chan said the gap between trains and the platform is relatively wide at these three stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the rail operator will reduce the gap when the automatic platform gates (APG) are installed, to ensure passenger safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the platform edge, there are the platform gap fillers. We will also widen the platform gap fillers to reduce the platform gap," Chan told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also have extra, additional broadcasting, so as to remind the passengers they have to pay attention to the platform gap after the APG opens."

    Enterprises improving defences against cyber attacks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An index measuring local enterprises' ability to respond to cybersecurity attacks has recorded the biggest jump to date, up by 5.8 points from last year to 52.8.
 <br>
  <br>
  442 companies were measured under the "Hong Kong Enterprise Cyber Security Readiness Index" compiled by the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the four areas covered in the index, "Human Awareness Building" has the most urgent need for improvement, the bodies said. The category refers to how aware and cautious employees are regarding potential cyber attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said this awareness has remained relatively low over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage enterprises to conduct training regularly, and this will include for example cyber security drill exercises as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said many hackers have been using AI to carry out their attacks, and deepfake videos used to fake identities can be made in under 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Chan, General Manager of Digital Transformation at the HKPC, said enterprises are encouraged to adopt AI for defence, such as detecting the voice prints of videos to check if they show a real person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will always say that AI is a double-edged sword. So that means attackers or bad actors are using AI to do attack, at the same time we should also use AI to uplift our defence," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To help enterprises better equip themselves against cyber attacks, the PCPD and the HKPC will be introducing a series of training packages, including a "data security training series for Small-and-Medium Enterprises" in 2025 and one on "Phishing Defence Services".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

    Rental bikes blocking paths 'common': Ombudsman

<img alt='The Ombudsman says the LCSD should take "decisive enforcement action" against any violations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation by the city's Ombudsman has found it is common for rental bike service operators to leave their bicycles where they block paths, saying the situation "invites doubts" as to whether the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) has taken action against offenders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday said business permits issued by the department to the operators explicitly forbid them from allowing rental bicycles to take up space outside designated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Operators placing their bicycles outside the permit area in violation of regulations not only causes an obstruction to passageways and affects members of the public to access and use recreational facilities, but may also pose safety hazards," said Ombudsman Jack Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our multiple site inspections found that it seems to be a common practice for operators to leave bicycles lying around in contravention of the regulations, and this has invited doubts as to whether the LCSD had reminded the operators of the irregularities or has taken enforcement action against them in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that LCSD staff issue reminders or warning letters depending on the severity of a situation, and can consider suspending an operator's business or terminating the contract if there's no evident improvement after a third warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  But guidelines do not clearly stipulate the number of verbal and written reminders to warrant a warning, the office said, or whether the notices have any validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said the department should take "decisive enforcement action" if any operator violates the contract terms, and look into enhancing the current enforcement regime and guidelines, among other suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ombudsman added that the LCSD has accepted all of its recommendations.

    Former UK deputy PM John Prescott dies aged 86

<div class="itemFullText">
 John Prescott, deputy prime minister to Britain's Tony Blair during his 10 years in government, has died aged 86 after a battle with Alzheimer's, his family said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prescott, who served under Blair from 1997 to 2007, was known as a plain-speaking politician who bridged the divide between the traditional left-wing and the modernisers in the Labour Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dubbed an old-school political "bruiser", he famously punched a member of the public during an election campaign in 2001, after he had been hit by an egg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, it would have all been better if it hadn't happened," Blair said at the time. But added: "John is John".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott was born on May 31, 1938, in a seaside house in Wales. His father was a railway signalman, his mother a maid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 17, he went to sea as a steward on a luxury cruise ship where boxing bouts were organised among the crew to entertain the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into politics after coming ashore and he attended Oxford's Ruskin College, which offered courses for mature students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prescott entered parliament in 1970 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming a key player in the Labour Party's historic three election victories from 1997 to 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acted as a peace broker in the often fraught relationship between Blair and his future successor, Gordon Brown, and was later called "Two Jags" after he used his ministerial car for a 200 yard journey, which he said was needed to prevent his wife's hair from being blown about in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blair said he was devastated by the news.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual," he said. "There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two of the nation's navy battleships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault ship,  arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday for a five-day visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the public can board the vessels for a look around.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Changsha and the Hainan were greeted by boats from the Fire Services Department, with the Hainan moored at China Merchants Wharf in Western.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers on board raised the national flag and waved to people on shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Defence said the visit was approved by the Central Military Commission and is part of an annual plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the visit is aimed at demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's determination and ability to defend the country's sovereignty and safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The visit also] further enhances the national identity and pride for compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, and for them to learn more about national defence and the achievements of the army's modernisation," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the vessels will be open to the public and soldiers based in the two SARs, and there will be seminars on national defence as well as cultural exchange activities.

    SAR has larger role in Belt and Road: Beijing official

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official has stressed that Hong Kong is playing a larger part in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the city's dispute resolution mechanism and an abundance of legal professionals provide services under the country's infrastructure development plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guangyuan, a deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, on Thursday said the SAR is "standing at the forefront" of the nation's opening up as an important functional platform for the initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Belt and Road conference in Hong Kong, the official said the One Country, Two Systems principle makes the territory a bridge connecting the mainland with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the only jurisdiction in the world with a bilingual common law system, and has a bigger role to play in facilitating Belt and Road cooperation," Liu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a complete dispute resolution mechanism, and serves as a preferred seat for resolving disputes among countries along the Belt and Road... The abundant legal talent reservoir in the city may be further tapped into to provide legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability is a "prerequisite" for prosperity in Hong Kong and a safeguard for the city's role in the development initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam, for his part, said at the same conference that Hong Kong has a special role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is renowned for having a sound and mature legal system, supported by the independent exercise of judicial power by our courts and a strong rule of law tradition. Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps between different jurisdictions along the Belt and Road," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a super-connector and a super value-adder, Hong Kong provides world-class legal services that facilitate business between China and the rest of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has a lot of legal professionals "with a strong Chinese legal and business background" as well as expertise in international law and practice, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will proactively integrate into the nation's development, maintain a free and open business environment, and serve as a springboard to attract and support enterprises.

<img alt="Duncan Chiu (left), chairman of the Squash Association of Hong Kong, China, has welcomed the establishment of a code of practice. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780200_1_20241121112245.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's squash association on Thursday urged the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China to provide flexibility for the sector over the introduction of a code of practice.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC on Wednesday held a briefing for its member associations about the new code, which provides guidelines on corporate governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that the term of office for directors of the associations should have a maximum length and recommends they stay for 16 years at most, along with an age limit of 75.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duncan Chiu, chairman of the Squash Association of Hong Kong, China, welcomed the introduction of the code but said he hopes compromises can be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not too many people participating in squash activities, and our committee consists of about 20 people. It's not easy to find people who can constantly help us... We hope they can provide some flexibility on this," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code also states that sports associations should establish a fair and transparent mechanism for the selection of athletes, to ensure equal opportunities for all those qualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiu, who's also a lawmaker, said his association would follow all the procedures, but he hopes people understand that different sports have different selection criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For running or swimming, it's easier because the standard is based on the time for finishing the race. But it may be more subjective for team sports, like football and basketball, the team chemistry among players is important too. So there are more criteria when selecting athletes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same programme that at next year's National Games, people will be able to see whether sports associations are being fair and transparent when selecting players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC will review the implementation of the code after two years, and any sports associations that fail to follow it will face penalties including cuts to government subsidies.

    Indian tycoon Adani charged in US over fraud

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire Indian industrialist Gautam Adani has been charged with paying hundreds of millions of dollars of bribes and hiding the payments from investors, US prosecutors said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a business empire spanning coal, airports, cement and media, the chairman of Adani Group has been rocked in recent years by corporate fraud allegations and a stock crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The close ally of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a fellow Gujarat native, is alleged to have agreed to pay more than US$250 million in bribes to Indian officials for lucrative solar energy supply contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were projected to generate more than US$2 billion in profits after tax, over roughly 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  None of the multiple defendants in the case, including Adani, are in custody, the prosecutor's office told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say one of Adani's alleged accomplices meticulously tracked bribe payments, using his phone to log the bungs offered to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This indictment alleges schemes to pay over US$250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice," said US Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gautam Adani and seven other business executives allegedly bribed the Indian government to finance lucrative contracts designed to benefit their businesses... while still other defendants allegedly attempted to conceal the bribery conspiracy by obstructing the government's investigation," said the FBI's James Dennehy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A self-described introvert, Adani keeps a low profile and rarely speaks to the media, often sending lieutenants to front corporate events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat state, to a middle-class family but dropped out of school at 16 and moved to financial capital Mumbai to find work in the city's lucrative gem trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a short stint in his brother's plastics business, he launched the flagship family conglomerate that bears his name in 1988 by branching out into the export trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  His big break came seven years later with a contract to build and operate a commercial shipping port in Gujarat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adani Group's rapid expansion into capital-intensive businesses previously raised alarms, with Fitch subsidiary and market researcher CreditSights warning in 2022 it was "deeply over-leveraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023 a bombshell report from US investment firm Hindenburg Research claimed the conglomerate had engaged in a "brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindenburg said a pattern of "government leniency towards the group" stretching back decades had left investors, journalists, citizens and politicians unwilling to challenge its conduct "for fear of reprisal." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin's march toward US$100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier US regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin prices topped US$95,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above US$95,040.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40 percent in the two weeks since Trump was voted in and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the US$100k level," said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$4 billion has streamed into US listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crypto-related stocks have been soaring along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 14 percent overnight, while MicroStrategy, a loss-making software company that has been buying bitcoin, rose 10 percent to take its market capitalisation beyond US$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many are wondering if this administration will bring the regulatory clarity the crypto community has been waiting for. It's likely too soon to say," said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund issuer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see all of this excitement as bullish not only for bitcoin or crypto broadly, but the entire blockchain-enabled ecosystem that is growing today." (Reuters)

    US defends decision to supply landmines to Ukraine

<img alt="The US-supplied mines can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780181_1_20241121091910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine – in a major policy shift – was triggered by a change in Russian battlefield tactics favouring infantry over mechanised units, US Defence Secretary Loyd Austin said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They don't lead with their mechanised forces any more," Austin told reporters while on a visit to Laos. "They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanised forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainians "have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Joe Biden's reversal of his previous curbs on US landmines comes just days after Washington gave Ukraine the green light to use US-made long-range missiles on targets within Russia, as the outgoing administration aims to give Kyiv the upper hand before President-elect Donald Trump enters office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden in 2022 said the United States would mostly ban its use of landmines, at the time specifically drawing a contrast with Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reversal comes amid concerns about the incoming Trump administration's lack of support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is entering office having repeatedly criticised US assistance for Ukraine, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Russia and the United States – neither of which are signatories to the UN Mine Ban Treaty – have been criticised for their past use of anti-personnel mines in the past. Ukraine is a signatory of the treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austin said the US-supplied mines would be so-called "nonpersistent" mines that can self-destruct or render themselves inactive after losing battery charge – in theory limiting the risk to civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv are jockeying to secure battlefield advantage before Trump assumes office next January.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, Kyiv fired US-supplied ATACMS missiles at Russian territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree lowering the threshold for when Russia could use nuclear weapons. (AFP)

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

    US martial arts master harnesses AI to teach kung fu

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 From a small town in America to China's Wudang Mountains, Tai Chi master Jake Pinnick says he finds artificial intelligence increasingly useful for teaching kung fu and translating traditional Chinese texts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The martial arts practitioner from Illinois, who has lived in China since 2010, is the 16th-generation disciple of the Wudang San Feng lineage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK during the ongoing World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Pinnick said he wanted to share his experience of using the internet to connect with students worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have classes with people in different countries, different time zones, and so really I just came here to share my experience with that hoping that there's more opportunity for connection," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit is themed around the use of AI and building a digital future for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kung fu coach said technological breakthroughs were a great help when it came to teaching martial arts on the mountains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, training martial arts, there's only so much that it can really help with as far as the martial arts side, like maybe with organising videos or adding subtitles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pinnick added that AI-powered tools can identify language, such as traditional Chinese text which can be difficult to translate, helping him to organise ideas faster and broadcast them to more people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the tech rivalry between China and the US, Pinnick said he believed it was a healthy competition that would lead to better communication tools and more connections between countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid eased into the Uefa Women's Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday with a 3-2 win over Dutch side FC Twente, while Chelsea also booked their places in the knockout phase with a win over Celtic en route to their third consecutive victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch hosts led through Jaimy Ravensbergen's opener, but Linda Caicedo levelled on the stroke of half-time before Madrid took control with goals from Signe Bruun and substitute Alba Redondo, who scored in added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twente pulled a goal back right at the end courtesy of Sophie te Brake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid are second on nine points but cannot be overtaken by Twente after winning both meetings between the teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can see Real Madrid going really far in this Women's Champions League campaign," said Danish forward Bruun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has always been my dream to win trophies," she added. "This one might be the biggest, so again, we're one step closer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, joining Real in the quarter-finals from the same section will be Chelsea – after they came away with a convincing 3-0 victory over Scottish club Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  England international Lucy Bronze struck with a volley in the second minute at Stamford Bridge, and Dutch midfielder Wieke Kaptein's header doubled Chelsea's lead midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eve Perisset added a third from the penalty spot in second-half stoppage time, as Women's Super League leaders Chelsea made it four wins from four in Group B to guarantee their passage to the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A great result. Really happy with the win, the three points, we are top of the table. It was really important to score the first goal especially really early in the game," Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We scored three goals, clean sheet, so a perfect night again," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have won all 11 games under Bompastor, who moved to London in May after three years in charge of Lyon. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis on Wednesday said he will canonise Carlo Acutis next April, setting the eagerly awaited date for the late teenager to become the Catholic Church’s first millennial and digital-era saint.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis made the announcement at the end of his weekly general audience on Wednesday, saying he would proclaim the church's youngest contemporary saint during the Jubilee of Adolescents at the Vatican on April 25-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials later confirmed the canonisation Mass would occur on April 27 at the Vatican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acutis, who was born to Italian parents in London, was a web designer who died of leukaemia in Italy in 2006 at the age of 15. Francis beatified him in 2020 in Assisi, where his tomb draws a steady stream of pilgrims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touted as the “patron saint of the internet,” Acutis used his natural tech talent to create a website to catalog miracles and took care of websites for some local Catholic organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis announced in May that he had approved a second miracle attributed to Acutis’ intercession, paving the way for Wednesday’s announcement. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday called on its Western allies not to fuel tensions inside the country, after a string of embassies in Kyiv announced they would close, citing the threat of a "massive air attack" on the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warnings of fresh strikes come as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has already ramped up a wave of deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine's energy grid. Air alerts blare out across the country daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States led the wave of closures, saying it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received "specific information of a potential significant air attack" on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit, announcing the closures of their diplomatic premises in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv said the "information" the US was referring to looked to be a "psychological operation" launched by Moscow in a bid to destabilise the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days," Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.

  Both Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for the upper hand on the battlefield before he re-enters the White House in January. (AFP)

 LPGA golfers will compete for a record US$131 million in prize money over a 33-event season in 2025, the tour's 75th anniversary campaign, LPGA officials announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the season-ending Tour Championship at Naples, Florida, next year's schedule was unveiled, including two new tournaments and two unofficial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total prize money will have jumped US$62 million in four years, next season's payout jumping 90 percent from the pandemic-hit 2021 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 season was another year of historic growth for the LPGA Tour, and with this 2025 schedule we will continue to improve on that growth," LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA's global schedule will begin two weeks later than this year and see competition in the United States and 11 other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The season-opening LPGA Tournament of Champions in Orlando on January 30-February 2 will be followed the next week by the Founders Cup at Bradenton before the tour heads for Asia in February and March for events in Thailand, Singapore and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA Match Play will be contested April 2 to 6 in Las Vegas ahead of the year's first women's major, the Chevron Championship at The Woodlands, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  May will feature two new LPGA events, the Black Desert Championship in Ivins, Utah on May 1 to 4 and the first LPGA event in Mexico since 2017, the Riviera Maya Open in Cancun on May 22 to 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second major, the US Women's Open, will be contested May 29 to June 1 at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, followed by the Women's PGA Championship on June 19 to 22 at PGA Frisco in Frisco, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year's final majors will be the Evian Championship in France on July 10-13 and the Women's British Open on July 31 to August 3 at Royal Porthcawl in Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA returns to North America until a late-season Asia swing with events in October at Shanghai, South Korea and Malaysia and a November stop in Japan before two final events, the Annika on November 13 to 16 and the 2025 season-ending Tour Championship in Naples on November 20 to 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean tournaments will include the biennial International Crown team event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FM Championship in Boston on August 28 to 31 will have a US$4.1 million purse, the first event to crack US$4 million in prize money outside of the majors and Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, nine tournaments will have elevated purses from 2024. (AFP)

<img alt="Italy celebrating after winning the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780161_1_20241121055027.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup for the fifth time as Jasmine Paolini beat Rebecca Sramkova to secure a dominant 2-0 win over Slovakia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number four Paolini triumphed 6-2, 6-1 in the second singles rubber to follow up Lucia Bronzetti's 6-2, 6-4 victory against Viktoria Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy were runners-up to Canada in last year's final but went one better in Malaga to become world champions for the first time since 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory capped a stunning year for Paolini who finished as runner-up at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable year, unbelievable, to finish like this with the Billie Jean King cup, it's amazing, I don't have words to describe it," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trying just to enjoy it, it's important to understand where you are, I feel lucky to be in this position – I feel lucky to be part of this team," she added. "I'm really happy that this year we could bring the trophy home again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, who won the competition in 2002, had never lost a BJK Cup tie in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underdogs defeated USA, Australia and Great Britain on a stunning run to this year's final, but Bronzetti breezed past Hruncakova in under 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Sramkova, ranked 43rd, survived two break points to hold for 2-2 in the first set but the superior Paolini broke for a 4-2 lead, which she consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian double faulted to hand Paolini two set points and the Italian took the first of them when Sramkova slapped a shot into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini broke in the second game of the second set and it looked like she might power to victory without a fight, but Sramkova immediately hit back to get back on serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova defeated Danielle Collins, Ajla Tomljanovic and Katie Boulter on Slovakia's charge to the final but Paolini was a bridge too far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Italian restored her advantage with a fizzing forehand to move 3-1 ahead and then consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having spent most of her career outside the top 50, 2024 has been a huge leap forward for Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  She broke again when Sramkova went long and served it out to seal an emphatic victory in one hour and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel so sad now, disappointed, but all respect to Italy, for what they did," a deflated Sramkova told reporters. "Maybe in a few days we will enjoy that we are second, and take something for the future from those matches." (AFP)

<img alt="Shares on Wall Street finished mixed after disappointing results from Target. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780160_1_20241121054617.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed at the end of a choppy session on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia earnings and sold off Target after weak results.
 <br>
  <br>
  One day after Walmart impressed investors with a bullish report ahead of the holiday shopping season, Target lost more than one-fifth of its market value as the retailer projected flat comparable sales in the coming quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Target "encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures," acknowledged CEO Brian Cornell, adding that he remained "confident in the underlying strength and fundamentals of our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 43,408.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,917, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 18,966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have been monitoring the brittle state of the Russia-Ukraine conflict after Moscow loosened its rules on using nuclear arms following Ukraine firing long-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  US investors have also been fixated on earnings from artificial intelligence star Nvidia due late on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 0.8 percent during the session and another 2.9 percent after the company reported US$19 billion in profits, easily topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Comcast rose 1.6 percent after announcing plans to pool together cable network channels including CNBC and MSNBC in a spin-off, further denting the conventional cable news business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford fell 2.9 percent as it announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe, mostly in Germany and Britain. Executives also signalled they expect the incoming Trump administration to shift course on energy and climate policy, likely slowing the ramp-up of electric vehicle production. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Wednesday said it strongly condemns and opposes some Western governments, anti-China groups and politicians, as well as foreign media for smearing and maliciously attacking the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s statement was in response to foreign criticism of court sentences handed down to 45 people on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman stressed the court made the decision following 118 days of open trial, and after going through an extensive amount of evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that all of the legal considerations were laid out in an 82-page judgement, which can be downloaded by members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the case had nothing to do with advocating democracy or freedoms, saying the offenders had engaged in acts that endanger national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government stressed it will continue to do all it takes to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' on HKSAR officials by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate People's Republic of China and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR despises such threats and will not be intimidated by such despicable behaviour. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely continue to discharge the duty of safeguarding national security."

<img alt='US Director Joel Souza - author of the "Rust" movie, talks during an AFP interview at Camerimage film festival in Torun, Poland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Western "Rust" will get its world premiere on Wednesday at a Polish film festival, three years after its cinematographer was killed in a tragic on-set shooting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hollywood star Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules in the 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins, but his involuntary manslaughter trial collapsed earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins's mother refused to attend the premiere "when there is still no justice for my daughter".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and take responsibility for her death," Olga Solovey said Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, will introduce the movie at the Camerimage film festival -- known for celebrating cinematography -- in Torun, northern Poland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the "massive devastation" of the shooting left him an emotional wreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rust' just became this sort of insane hurricane," he told AFP. "You're just left to sort of pick up the pieces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The filmmaker admitted that he agonised over whether to complete the movie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely on the fence... There was a time when I thought I just didn't want to make movies anymore," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said what convinced him to finish it was learning that Hutchins's husband wanted her final work to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camerimage said it was also Hutchins's "dream" to have her work shown at the festival, but that "Baldwin will not be there".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy-winning actor was holding a revolver during a rehearsal on set in New Mexico when a live round was fired, fatally wounding 42-year-old Hutchins.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tragic irony, the film centres on an accidental killing -- a parallel that Souza called "unsettling".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a strange one to unpack. When people hear about it, they generally fall silent for a few moments because they can't believe" it, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza and Baldwin developed the script from research Souza was doing on the youngest person ever to be hanged in the Old West.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rust" tells the story of an outlaw who rides to rescue his 13-year-old grandson from execution for an accident being treated as murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for accidentally loading Baldwin's prop gun with a live round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baldwin's own trial spectacularly collapsed in July when it emerged that prosecutors had not turned over a batch of bullets that detectives had found during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming was halted by the fatal incident, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins, a former journalist who grew up in Ukraine, had been named as one of the industry's rising stars in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the tragedy prompted some calls for banning firearms from sets altogether, new Hollywood guidelines now specify that only an armourer can hand a weapon to an actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Baldwin was handed the gun on set by the film's first assistant director, who later pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza said "the safety bulletin doesn't go quite far enough. I think they should mandate that no real weapons be used."
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Rust" premiere is not the only controversy at the festival, whosejury is presided over this year by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett.
  <br>
  <br>
  French director Coralie Fargeat pulled her movie starring Demi Moore, "The Substance" -- which won best screenplay at Cannes -- "after discovering the highly misogynistic and offensive words" of festival founder Marek Zydowicz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zydowicz was forced to apologise after appearing to suggest that including more women cinematographers might lead to "mediocre film production" in the line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks, for which Zydowicz later apologised, also led Oscar-winning director British director Steve McQueen, a double Oscar winner for "12 Years A Slave", to also stay away in protest at what he called the "deeply offensive words". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai woman was sentenced to death on Wednesday for poisoning a friend with cyanide, in the first of her 14 murder trials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, an online gambling addict, is accused of swindling thousands of dollars from her victims before killing them with the chemical.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court in Bangkok convicted her on Wednesday for fatally poisoning her friend Siriporn Kanwong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two met up near Bangkok in April last year to release fish into the Mae Klong river as part of a Buddhist ritual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siriporn collapsed and died shortly afterwards and investigators found traces of cyanide in her body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were then able to link Sararat to previously unsolved cyanide poisonings going back as far as 2015, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision is just," Siriporn's mother, Tongpin Kiatchanasiri, told reporters following the verdict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to tell my daughter that I miss her deeply, and justice has been done for her today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Sararat funded her gambling addiction by borrowing money from her victims -- in one case as much as 300,000 baht (nearly US$9,000) -- before killing them and stealing their jewellery and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  She lured 15 people -- one of whom survived -- to take poisoned "herb capsules", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sararat faces 13 more separate murder trials, and has been charged with around 80 offences in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ex-husband -- a police lieutenant-colonel -- was given 16 months in prison and her former lawyer two years for complicity in Siriporn's killing, the lawyer for the victim's family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand has been the scene of several sordid and high-profile criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, six foreigners were found dead in a luxury Bangkok hotel after a cyanide poisoning believed to be connected to debts worth millions of baht. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean super producer behind the chart-topping girl band NewJeans resigned from her label Wednesday, following a protracted legal battle with BTS's agency HYBE that has rocked the country's K-pop industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE" and vowed legal action against the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The saga began in April, when HYBE launched an audit of subsidiary ADOR -- NewJeans' label -- and attempted to push Min out, accusing her of breach of trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle, with Min accusing HYBE of copying her star-making formula for a competing girl band, which has seen the boardroom workings of K-pop hashed out in South Korean courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min slammed HYBE's action against her as a "witch hunt" in a statement Wednesday, saying she would take "necessary legal actions" against the company and individuals over the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she would embark on "new K-pop journey" in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br>
  <br>
  The members of NewJeans have publicly shown full support for Min and demanded that she be reinstated as ADOR's CEO at a livestream in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The girl group also sent a formal legal notice to HYBE last week, demanding six specific actions, including reinstating Min, and warning that failure to meet them could lead to the termination of their exclusive contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR said in a statement Wednesday that it was "regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further," it said. (AFP)

    Death-row drug convict to be sent back to Philippines

<img alt="Family members of drug trafficking inmate Mary Jane Veloso hold placards pleading for help. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780123_2_20241120193418.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that a deal has been reached for Indonesia to send home a Filipino death-row drug convict who was nearly executed by firing squad but got a reprieve due to years of pleadings from Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcos thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for granting a longstanding Philippine request for Mary Jane Veloso to be brought back home to serve her sentence in her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,” Marcos said in a statement. “Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when Veloso would be flown back to the Philippines, but Marcos said he looked forward to welcoming her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights and Immigration, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, confirmed that Subianto has given his approval for Veloso's return to the Philippines. That may happen in December, as long as conditions were met, including her continued detention in her country as part of the Indonesian court's sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines should also shoulder the costs of her repatriation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said at a news conference in Manila that Filipino authorities would discuss the legal terms of Veloso's transfer with their Indonesian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian government has asked the Department of Justice in Manila to formally request Veloso's transfer back to the Philippines, Justice Department spokesperson Mico Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision, Marcos said, “is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia — united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's transfer would remove the possibility of her facing an execution because the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has long abolished the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, Indonesian authorities moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from the convicts' home countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia executed the eight other convicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso’s case has caused a public outcry in the Philippines, where her family and supporters contend she is innocent and was unaware that 2.6 kilograms of heroin was concealed in her suitcase. The drugs were discovered when she entered Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso travelled to Indonesia in 2010 where her godsister reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Her godsister also allegedly provided the suitcase where the prohibited drugs were found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine authorities had filed criminal complaints, including for human trafficking, against illegal Filipino recruiters who arranged for Veloso to work in Indonesia, Clavano said. She added that she would serve as a crucial witness in the trial of the suspects when she returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  That Philippine case helped convince Indonesian authorities to delay Veloso's execution and eventually consider her transfer back to her country, Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos said Veloso’s story resonated with many in the Philippines, as “a mother trapped by the grip of poverty, who made one desperate choice that altered the course of her life."
  <br>
  <br>
  “While she was held accountable under Indonesian law, she remains a victim of her circumstances," Marcos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines has been a global source of manual labour, including many impoverished women who abandon their families for higher-paying jobs and better opportunities abroad. Alarming abuse, especially of Filipina house helpers, has prompted Philippine authorities to impose restrictions and safeguards but many continue to be exploited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 59 Filipinos around the world face the death penalty mostly for drug and murder convictions, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Wednesday began testifying in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he had made donations to local and overseas groups, including think-tanks and religious organisations in the United States amounting to up to US$50,000 a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple Daily founder added that he donated £20,000 to the UK-based group Hong Kong Watch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also said he asked former top US officials to “voice out” for Hong Kong five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told the High Court that he met then vice-president Mike Pence and then secretary of state Mike Pompeo during his trip to Washington in July 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he asked Pence to voice support for Hong Kong, adding that it would be “beyond” him to ask Pence to take any concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also acknowledged that he had directed Apple Daily to use news of a meeting between former chief secretary Anson Chan and Pence in 2019 to its “maximum effect”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former media tycoon has pleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The questioning is estimated to take 15 days, according to the defence.

    Sports bodies that don't improve face subsidy cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong must remain agile and innovative amid evolving global dynamics, adding that countries and businesses are still adapting and transforming to thrive in a changing environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving a speech at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, Chan said there is no reason for pessimism, despite the market bracing for potential headwinds from a changing geopolitical landscape and a new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China, for example, has been undergoing remarkable economic transformation, marked by a shift towards high-quality economic growth, supported by domestic consumption, technological innovation, green investment, advanced manufacturing and many more. Chinese enterprises are also expanding their global industry and supply chain footprint in response to shifting geopolitics,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For Hong Kong, our strategy is to continue to engage with traditional markets like the US and Europe, focusing on co-operation in areas of common interests and mutual benefits.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there is still potential and ample room for cooperation across various sectors, including urban planning, infrastructure, ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards and efforts to combat climate change, despite the influence of geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Belt and Road countries, along with the Global South as a whole, offer vast and untapped business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Global South now contributes to about 60 percent of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity, and accounts for over 40 percent of global imports and exports. If we just look at Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), it is collectively on track to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What characterise these markets are rapid economic growth, young populations and an expanding middle class. And above all, they all share a strong aspiration for progress by pursuing investments in infrastructure, green transformation and technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Amid challenging global landscape, they are also seeking to diversify their investments and asset allocation. We are making significant strides to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the growth of these emerging markets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong continues to be an attractive partner for investors and businesses globally, given the city’s international outlook and commitment to innovation.

    Phase 1 of Shenzhen-HK tech zone plan expanded

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday unveiled the development outline for the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, with the gross floor area in phase one doubling from what was initially planned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone stretches across the Shenzhen River, covering 302 hectares in Shenzhen and 87 hectares in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR section will be developed in two five-year phases, with phase one covering 1 million square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing the future development, in particular the high demand from the market for the Hetao Hong Kong Park, we decided to greatly increase the floor area. And after the hard work and also discussions with the other bureaus and departments, eventually we are able to offer about 1 million square metres for the phase one development," Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone will feature three main areas, focusing on life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, and advanced manufacturing and new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the space in phase one is planned for laboratories and research areas, while there will be land set aside for accommodation, visitor lodges and commercial spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, a contact-less clearance process will be implemented to link the parks in Shenzhen and Hong Kong to facilitate personnel flow, and to allow people crossing the border to travel to other parts of the SAR as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Carrie Chang said the government will discuss details with mainland authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this point in time, our thinking is that those people would have to be pre-registered. In terms of who they are, they should be the employees of the tenants of the two parks (because) they do have the need to commute between the two parks frequently," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the list should be accepted by both authorities because after all, it's cross-boundary travel. When we have further details, after further discussions with the mainland authorities, we will inform the members of the public suitably."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government added that there are plans to build footbridges over the Shenzhen River to link the Shenzhen and Hong Kong parks as well, but details are still being discussed.
