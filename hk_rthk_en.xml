<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Hong Kong rallied more than three percent in the morning session, in line with an advance across Asian markets after Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached deals to delay US tariffs for a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rallied 3.11 percent in the morning session, or 629 points, to 20,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were sent tumbling on Monday after the US president at the weekend signed off 25 percent duties against Mexico and Canada, fanning concerns for the stuttering global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors were given a much-needed shot in the arm after the Trump administration said it had struck deals with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on immigration and fentanyl, and would postpone the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added he would hold talks with Beijing "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese markets remain closed due to the Lunar New Year holiday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 People wrapped up warm on Tuesday as local temperatures fell to 12 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said districts like Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin saw temperatures lower than that.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said an intense northeast monsoon is bringing cold weather to the coast of Guangdong, which is why temperatures dipped on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man told RTHK he wasn't too bothered by the colder weather, but made sure he wrapped up warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very cold. It's much colder than I expected, but it's still pleasant right now. I've got to make sure I'm wearing two to three layers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another person hoped it would get warmer again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't like this. I feel more comfortable with warmer weather," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection reminded the public, especially the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, to protect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Elderly people have less insulating fat beneath their skin to keep them warm, and their body temperature control mechanisms may be weaker. Their body may not be able to appropriately respond to the cold weather," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said temperatures would rise slightly in the coming few days, but would drop again over the weekend.

    El Salvador offers to jail Americans: Marco Rubio

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele as the pair discussed the transfer of prisoners from America to El Salvador. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790192_1_20250204114042.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 El Salvador's leader has made the offer to jail Americans sent by their own country, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There is virtually no precedent in contemporary times for a democratic country to send its own citizens to foreign jails, and any attempt to do so is sure to be challenged in US courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rubio welcomed an offer to do just that by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose sweeping crackdown on crime has won him soaring popularity at home and hero status for many in US President Donald Trump's orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those with US citizenship and legal residency," Rubio told reporters in San Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's ever made an offer of friendship such as this," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are profoundly grateful. I spoke to President Trump about this earlier today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as nationals of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio appeared to suggest that the prison transfer would focus on members of Latin American gangs, such as El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, who have acquired US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal -- MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be -- he has offered his jails," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his return to the White House last month, Trump has put a top priority on speeding up the deportation of millions of people in the United States without legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sought to crack down on the right to birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also unveiled plans to detain 30,000 migrants at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a prison which previous Democratic presidents hoped to close. (AFP)

    Wang, Rubio could meet in two weeks in New York

<div class="itemFullText">
 A United Nations Security Council meeting in two weeks could be a "very good opportunity" for Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to meet, China's UN envoy said on Monday, stressing the need for cooperation because "so much is at stake," while blasting Washington on tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is president of the Security Council for February, and China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong said Wang would chair a ministerial meeting of the 15-member body on February 18 that would focus on multilateralism and improving global governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Rubio would attend the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and Rubio have spoken on the phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do hope that despite all the rhetoric that we have heard from the American politicians, we can take a constructive and – I will emphasise – a professional approach to our work here in the United Nations," Fu told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So much is at stake."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he did not hold back on US President Donald Trump's decision to impose 10 percent tariffs on China from Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly opposed to this unwarranted increase and we do believe that this is in violation of the WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. So that's why China is filing a complaint at this WTO," Fu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may be forced to take counter measures... there is no winner in a trade war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suspended his threat of steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the two neighbouring countries. No such deal has emerged for China, and a White House spokesperson said Trump would not be speaking with President Xi Jinping until later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fu also said China and the US could cooperate on combating climate change, drugs and terrorism and work together on technology like AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said fragmentation on AI would enhance risk and reduce benefits. (Reuters)

    Lawmakers urge govt departments to cut spending

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Tuesday said government departments should study ways to reduce spending to tackle a fiscal deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang told a radio programme that the government should review the size and work of the civil service to save public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, among more than 2,000 civil servants in the Labour Department, around 600 of them are working on employment services, which are not related to law enforcement. For employment services, shouldn't we consider outsourcing them to the third sector?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Labour Department spends around HK$600 to HK$800 million annually on employment services, but some work could be delegated to non-profit organisations instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said the administration should look for ways to cut spending on education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our birth rate is very low. We now have around half as many children as we did a decade ago. But we don't see primary education fees being reduced by half. Instead, it keeps going up every year. We need to look into this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether HK$2 subsidised transport fares for the over 60s should be adjusted, Tang said he thinks distance-based fares should be implemented instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Shiu said officials could consider setting usage limits or excluding some people still in work from getting the subsidised fares, depending on which sector they are employed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan will deliver his budget speech on February 26.

    'China's approach to tariffs contrasts with the US'

<img alt="Analysts believe any potential Chinese countermeasures against US tariffs would be related to the military and tech sectors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790179_1_20250204102142.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political commentator said China’s move to file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the Trump administration's tariff threats aims to create a contrast to the US's practice of dealing with things.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had announced a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties, a measure which was supposed to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held out the prospect of a deal with an announcement on Monday that talks between Beijing and Washington on tariffs would happen within "the next 24 hours".
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that Beijing is "colouring within the lines of the international order" by turning to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the US has not allowed any appellate judges to be appointed since the Obama administration. That means that they can't render a final decision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I think China is trying to create a stark contrast between what it's willing to do and Donald Trump who seems to... he likes colouring outside the lines. He likes to be brash, bold. He likes to threaten people. And though he generally will pivot on a dime if things aren’t going well, it's still a very marked contrast between two different responses."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Beijing has yet to impose any countermeasures, Tangen believes they could be related to military and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, China has a very large position in the rare earths area, it's indicated before, and has imposed some restrictions on that. You have to register to get some of the... rare earths and things like that. And they said they're not going to export them for military use. And I see that probably is where they're going to concentrate," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Regina Ip said Hong Kong has to be more flexible in dealing with incoming challenges, saying the fact that Mexico and Canada were able to delay the imposition of tariffs on their goods underlines the importance of engaging with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, you need to engage. On the other hand, you need to strengthen yourself and have an arsenal of tools to respond if necessary," Ip told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has much less leverage being only an SAR. But we have full backing from our country. I think we need to be more nuanced and be more flexible in our approach when we deal with these sort of great power threats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who chairs the New People's Party, said people doing business in the Hong Kong are more concerned about interest rates than tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want interest rates to come down to lessen the debt burden on many of our investors, including property tycoons. The continued trend of lowering interest rates would spur our economic growth. We hope the [US Federal Reserve] would resume the downward trend of interest rates if a trade war could be avoided," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City signed Nico González from Porto in the biggest move from Premier League clubs on transfer deadline day, while Bayern Munich's Mathys Tel headed to Tottenham on loan.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's midfield frailties without Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who is out for the season due to a serious knee injury, were exposed in a 5-1 thrashing at Arsenal on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men find themselves in a battle just to qualify for next season's Champions League, with the defending champions sitting fourth in the Premier League, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  City were also in need of reinforcements for a blockbuster Champions League play-off round tie against holders Real Madrid later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Barcelona midfielder González, 23, arrives for a reported fee of US$62 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the perfect opportunity for me at this stage of my career," said González. "I know the reputation Pep has and I cannot wait to work with him. In fact, I am honoured he wants me to play in his team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham were busy in the final hours of the window as they bolstered Ange Postecoglou's injury-ravaged squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tel reportedly turned down the opportunity to join Spurs earlier in the window after a deal was agreed with the German giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the French under-21 international has now moved to north London until the end of the season with an option to make the move permanent in the summer. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich has announced they had extended the contract of their long-standing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to the end of the 2025 to 2026 season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement puts an end to speculation about Neuer's future at the Bundesliga club, where his contract was set to expire at the end of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who has made over 500 appearances for the Bavarian giants, was "the best goalkeeper of his generation and a Bayern icon", sporting chief Max Eberl said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club were "delighted" that Neuer would stay on for what will be his 15th season with Bayern, after joining from domestic rivals Schalke in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer said in the statement he wanted to keep playing football and "remain a Bayern player" for the upcoming season.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 11 Bundesliga titles and two Champions League trophies with the club, Neuer said he was "still hungry" for more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who retired from international football last year after Germany hosted the Euros, has recently returned from injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's stalwart broke a rib in a collision in December during a match against Bayer Leverkusen, which sidelined him through the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old had previously expressed his desire to keep playing beyond the end of the year, despite growing competition for his spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Nuebel, who has a contract with Bayern until 2029 but is currently on loan at Stuttgart until 2026, is widely believed to be in line to replace Neuer in Munich. (AFP)

    Trump says he's pausing tariffs on Canada after talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump delayed the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month on Monday after America's neighbours struck last-minute deals to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and the drug fentanyl.
 <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets had slumped as Trump's threat of sweeping 25 percent levies on exports from Canada and Mexico to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after calls with Trump just hours before the US tariffs were due to take effect, both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum struck deals for a postponement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that after "very friendly" talks with Sheinbaum he'd "immediately pause" the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions appeared higher between the US and Canada, but after two separate calls Trump later said he was "very pleased" and was announcing a 30-day halt in the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks on final deals would continue with both countries, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said after the "good call" that Canada deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a "Fentanyl Czar" and crack down on money laundering.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that just this December authorities there said they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  China remains in the firing line for Trump tariffs. It faces a further 10 percent duty on top of existing levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said last-minute talks between Washington and Beijing will likely be held "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, China and Mexico are the United States's three biggest trading partners, and Trump's threatened tariffs have sent shock waves through the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's three main indices fell sharply in early deals, but clawed back ground after Trump's announcement on the Mexico deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a trade war, this is a drug war," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that "the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its most populous province Ontario on Monday had banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk's Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada's existence into question -- once again calling on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.
  <br>
  <br>
  A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump's tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing earlier this month that he would quit too. Canadians now face elections as early as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president -- who has said that tariff is the "most beautiful word in the dictionary" -- is going even further in his second term on the levies than he did in his first.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has insisted that the impact would be borne by foreign exporters without being passed on to American consumers, despite most experts saying the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the billionaire 78-year-old did acknowledge as he returned from a weekend at his Florida resort Sunday that Americans might feel economic "pain".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also wielded tariffs as a threat to achieve his wider policy goals, most recently when he said he would slap them on Colombia when it turned back US military planes carrying deported migrants. (AFP)

    Resilient Chelsea impress in comeback against West Ham

<div class="itemFullText">
 Enzo Maresca hailed Chelsea's mental strength as they came from behind to beat West Ham 2-1 and move into fourth place in the Premier League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maresca's side trailed to Jarrod Bowen's strike late in the first half at Stamford Bridge, sparking jeers from frustrated fans after a lethargic start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca's decision to send on Pedro Neto in the second half proved decisive as the Portugal forward bagged Chelsea's equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has been so often over the last two seasons, Cole Palmer was the catalyst for the Blues' 74th-minute winner when his cross deflected in off West Ham defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a disappointing run of one win in seven league games, Maresca was relieved to see Chelsea get back on track in spirited fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is huge. Today was a tough game, especially mentally. When West Ham come here and sit back with 10 players behind the ball, it's not easy. You have to be mentally strong and you need to be patient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had more than 10 shots in the first half," he added. "We had clear chances in the first half but unfortunately, we missed the target. With some changes the game changed. Overall we completely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca has been concerned that his players were distracted by speculation over potential transfers in and out of Stamford Bridge leading up to Monday's deadline day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relieved that the window would be closed, the Italian can focus on leading Chelsea's fight to qualify for next season's Champions League via a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good weekend for us in terms of results and we knew today was even better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are there and hopefully we can be there until the end," he added. "Playing this kind of game in February, where we are still there, is an important statement." (AFP)

    US stocks join global markets' retreat on tariff news

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended lower on Monday, following falls in overseas markets after US President Trump announced tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump later modified his weekend tariff announcement, suspending the levies on Mexico for 30 days following talks with his Mexican counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  But all three major US indices still ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.3 percent to 44,421.91.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.8 percent to 5,994.57, and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.2 percent to 19,391.96.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs are "considered a cost that will likely push prices higher and growth lower," said Jack Ablin of Cresset capital, who noted Trump has threatened tariffs on other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is adapting not just to more tariffs, but more headline risk," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's session underscored the greater exposure of some sectors to tariffs compared with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those falling were automakers like General Motors, down 3.2 percent, homebuilders such as Lennar, down 3.9 percent, and agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co., down two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reaction in other sectors was muted. Companies in finance, insurance and telecommunications, either advanced or experienced small declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from trade talks, key events this week include quarterly earnings from Google parent Alphabet and Ford, and US jobs data. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk, the world's richest person and US President Donald Trump's controversial close advisor, said on Monday the giant USAID humanitarian agency will be "shutting down" as part of his drive to shrink the US government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated it was not disappearing but would come under his control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the acting director of USAID," Rubio told reporters on a visit to El Salvador, accusing the agency of "insubordination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid confusion over the future of the US Agency for International Development, employees were instructed by email not to go to their offices Monday. Some 600 staffers found themselves locked out of their computer systems, ABC News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID is the aid arm of US foreign policy, funding health and emergency programs in around 120 countries, including the world's poorest regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also seen as a source of soft power for US foreign policy, which Musk accused of being "corrupt" and involved in an array of political activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who has massive contracts with the US government and was the biggest financial backer of Trump's campaign, said he had personally cleared the unprecedented move with the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went over with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down," Musk said in a discussion on his X online platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Musk's aides have taken control of the US Treasury Department's payments system - which manages trillions of dollars of transactions each year -- sparking alarm among critics. (AFP)

    Trump confirms one-month 'pause' in Mexico tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for one month after last-minute talks on Monday, but there was no breakthrough yet in negotiations with Canada on an issue that has sparked fears of a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  As world markets slumped, Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum both announced the halt in the levies after she agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border following talks on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on his Truth Social network that after the "very friendly conversation" he had "agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period."
  <br>
  <br>
  During that time there would be further talks "as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries," the Republican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leftist Sheinbaum had announced the tariff pause a few minutes earlier, saying she had a "good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump agreed to increase measures to prevent trafficking of US weapons into Mexico, she said, a point that did not appear in Trump's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development came hours before the 25 percent levies that Trump has ordered on imports from the US neighbors and chief trading partners, plus an extra 10 percent on China, were due to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had also spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and was due to speak again, but the White House said negotiations with Ottawa were not going as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump repeated his frequent claims that the United States is being unfairly treated by trade while pushing his argument that the tariffs were about a "drug war" from opioids "pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada. (AFP)

    Greece's Santorini on alert after seismic activity

<img alt="Dust rises following a landslide during high seismic activity on Santorini. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790129_1_20250203220204.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands – all popular summer vacation destinations – after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rock slides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,” Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late on Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. “We urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimise risk.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini’s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.
  <br>
  <br>
  The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency – an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried," said Michalis Gerontakis, who is also the director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,” Gerontakis said. "When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can knows what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog," said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different," said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I need to get away for a few days until things calm down,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I wasn’t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer," Fragiadakis said. "I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said while US "protectionist policies" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025," he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam.

    Retail sales drop for 10th consecutive month

<img alt="A government spokesman says retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790100_1_20250203170154.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales dropped 9.7 percent in December year-on-year, marking the 10th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from the Census and Statistics Department released on Monday, the value of total retail sales in December was estimated at HK$32.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decrease followed a revised 7.3 percent fall in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw a sharp decline of 36.3 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 22 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said retail sales declined further in December, partly due to more Hong Kong residents travelling abroad during the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the provisional data showed retail sales for the whole of 2024 decreased by 7.3 percent when compared with the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said the retail sector would benefit due to various measures introduced by the central government and proactive efforts by the SAR authorities to promote tourism, boost market sentiment and increase employment earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, said while the sector is expecting a continuous decline in business for January and February, there is some cause for optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is hope for the increased business from mainland tourists, especially with the resumption of the multiple-entry individual visit scheme for Shenzhen residents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Members are observing changes in tourist foot traffic, spending patterns and basket sizes. While foot traffic may increase, purchasing power remains weak and we need time to see the foot effects."

    Trial of Spain's ex-soccer boss for forced kiss begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The highly anticipated trial of Spain's disgraced former football chief Luis Rubiales over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso began on Monday with the player scheduled to take the stand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales and Hermoso did not greet each other as they arrived at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid for the trial scheduled to run until February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kiss was given "unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player", prosecutors wrote in their indictment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on February 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. (AFP)

    'Prosecutions not the aim of housing abuse offence'

<img alt="Winnie Ho says the plan to criminalise serious public housing abuse is to ensure the proper use of public resources. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790108_1_20250203172634.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Monday that a plan to criminalise serious abuse of public housing  isn't about prosecuting people or getting them out of their homes, but ensuring the proper use of public resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed legal changes, people deemed to have seriously abused their tenancy, such as subletting their flat or using it for commercial purposes, would risk a prison term of up to 12 months and a fine as high as HK$500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said if all goes smoothly, officials plan to table the relevant bill to the legislature in the next quarter, with a view to the law coming into effect in the second quarter of next year at the earliest.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco housing panel meeting, she told lawmakers that tenants would be allowed to work from home, as long as business activities don't take place inside the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many people nowadays work from home. Also, many people are interested in making some handicrafts and they sell them somewhere else, instead of using the flat for commercial purposes. All these will be allowed," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said tenants won't be allowed to "run the flat like a tuition centre or a gym room" with many people going in and out or price lists available, even if they also live in the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on tenants to exercise caution if they use the address for business registration purposes, because it might raise suspicions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that the authorities will use common sense when they handle breaches of the rules.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the annual Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon say they have attracted a vibrant crowd of international runners this year, with many elite athletes expected to be in attendance.
 <br>
  <br>
  74,000 runners are set to participate this Sunday, including over 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will also be 14 male and 10 female elite runners joining, primarily from Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said there is much to look forward to at this year's event, including pre-marathon activities at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day expo kicks off on Wednesday, featuring more than 40 booths filled with games and photo opportunities, with the aim of attracting over 120,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The basic function of the marathon expo would be for the runners to collect their runner's packs. Apart from that, we would like the runners as well as the public to experience the marathon atmosphere at the marathon expo," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can enjoy the booths from the sponsors, from the Hong Kong AAA or even from our beneficiaries in the marathon charity programme to learn more about the marathon history and what our beneficiaries are doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathons will start on Nathan Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, while the 10-kilometre race will begin at the Island Eastern Corridor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the 10-kilometre wheelchair race, wheelchair trial, and Leaders Cup will commence at Wan Chai Sports Ground, with all events finishing at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Road closures will begin in phases starting from 11.30pm on Saturday and all the roads closed are expected to reopen by 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full and half marathon race routes will lead to extensive temporary road closures in the Yau Tsim Mong area, including sections of Nathan Road and Argyle Street. The roads affected are expected to be open again by around 10.30am, depending on race progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the full marathon will utilise the Kowloon-bound carriageways of the Cheung Tsing Highway and related tunnels, resulting in vehicle diversions that may cause traffic congestion near North Lantau Highway and the Tsing Ma Bridge, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Public transport services will also face significant adjustments and the public are advised to travel by MTR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Actress Barbie Hsu, who was hugely popular across Asia for her leading role in the 2001 television drama "Meteor Garden", died from a respiratory illness, media reported Monday. She was 48.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsu passed away after developing pneumonia during a family trip to Japan over the Lunar New Year holiday, the younger of her two sisters was quoted as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My dearest and kindest sister Barbie Hsu sadly left us due to influenza complications that led to pneumonia," the younger Hsu said in a statement shared by her agent and reported by the Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful to have been her sister in this lifetime, to take care of each other, accompany each other, I will forever be thankful to her and miss her."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taiwan star's death was the top trending topic on Weibo on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans around Asia and elsewhere also paid tribute to her on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Actor Huang Xiaoming, who starred with Hsu in another drama, said he was "in shock and deep grief" over her death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've heard that truly brilliant souls are never dimmed by time -- they remain vibrant, like bubbles shining in the sun," Huang said on Weibo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stacy Hsu, a Taiwan celebrity, posted on Facebook that Hsu's "beauty and intelligence will forever remain in our hearts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsu and her younger sister Dee rose to fame in the 1990s as a pop duo before switching to hosting TV shows and acting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the elder Hsu's role as Dong Shan Cai in the popular 2001 television series "Meteor Garden" that made her a star across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show about an ordinary girl attending an elite university was originally based on a Japanese manga series.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was later remade in China and now screens on Netflix. (AFP)

    Markets grapple with fallout from Trump's trade war

<img alt="Investors around the world and in Asia are coming to terms with the sobering implications of the Trump administration's tariff salvo against Canada, Mexico and China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790078_1_20250203135559.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors bought dollars, sold stocks and fretted about inflation on Monday in a scramble to assess the risk of a trade war after Donald Trump put tariffs on top US trading partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's orders for additional levies of 25 percent on imports from Mexico and most goods from Canada, as well as 10 percent on goods from China are light on detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they kick in on Tuesday and have jolted markets that had assumed Trump was mostly bluff and bluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  The selloff extended beyond just Canadian and Mexican markets and stocks directly in the line of fire, to cryptocurrencies, stocks and even the safe-haven Japanese yen, as investors tried to second-guess the volatile president's next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Worries about the hit to growth from the inflationary impact of the wide-ranging tariffs and the uncertainty that creates for the Federal Reserve played a part, causing everything but the dollar and long-term US Treasuries to be sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's trade war has started," said Alvin Tan, head of Asia currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore, noting it was hard to see the US dollar retreating any time soon.

  <br>
  The dollar has been the main mover, gaining as Trump headed for and then won office because investors figured tariff-hit countries would weaken their currencies to offset the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the euro fell 1.3 percent on fears Europe may be next on the tariff list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada's dollar skidded to a 20-year low on the greenback, China's yuan slid in offshore trade, oil jumped, metals slumped and US equity futures dropped about two percent on risks to US companies' bottom lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the tariffs may cause "short term" pain for Americans, and while he would speak on Monday with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, which have announced retaliatory tariffs of their own, he downplayed expectations that they would change his mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said equity bulls are re-evaluating their Trump trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity bulls seduced by 'Trump is good for equities' narrative are subject to a rude wake-up call from the potentially jarring impact on growth/earnings amid retaliatory tariff spirals," Mizuho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Taipei made losses around two percent in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock futures slid 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has linked the tariffs to the flow of migrants and drugs - particularly fentanyl - into the US and demanded crackdowns in Canada, China and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Mexico have said fentanyl is America's problem, so prospects of a breakthrough are unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it would challenge Trump's tariffs at the World Trade Organisation and take unspecified countermeasures. (Reuters)

    Regulator calls for review after tour guide's death

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Authority (TIA) said on Monday it was high time for the sector to consider whether it is necessary for tour guides to stand and talk on a moving coach.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after a guide was thrown out of a vehicle and died in a crash in Shanghai last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's executive director, Annie Fonda, said authorities there were still investigating, and the TIA would keep in contact with them to see what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said agencies should study whether tour guides should be wearing their seat belts at all times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this incident, I think the trade can share their views about whether it's really necessary for tour guides to stand on a [moving] coach and speak to tour members," Fonda said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety belts are important. Say, on airplanes, flight attendants can put on their seat belts while seated as they face passengers. These are things we can study."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the guide was a freelancer and his company, Miramar Travel, had bought work insurance for his trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, unionist Lam Chi-ting agreed the sector could study fitting standing-room seat belts for tour guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the director of the Tourism Industry Employees' General Union said on RTHK that it's unavoidable that guides have to move around the vehicle, such as collecting travel documents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said he is cautiously optimistic about the city's stock market performance in the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  At an opening ceremony as the bourse began its first trading session of the new year, Chan noted that stocks saw their best performance in seven years during the Year of the Dragon, with the benchmark index rising more than 28 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said he has consulted several popular artificial intelligence large language models on the SAR's outlook for the coming 12 months and all suggested the markets will be "flexible, smooth and prosperous", despite external challenges including from geopolitics and trade tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the market outlook for the Year of the Snake, I am cautiously optimistic and happy to see a better performance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support from the country, along with the cooperation between the SAR government, regulators, and the industry, we can actively and flexibly respond to challenges, seize opportunities and explore new ideas and measures to further enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of the city's listing platform, while pushing the city's finance industry to new heights," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Chan, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) Carlson Tong said officials will continue to roll out new financial products, and will carry out reforms to woo investors and global enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite ongoing challenges, I'm optimistic about the coming year with the planned new product launches, multi-year platforms development, market reforms, and expansion of our international networks," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year also marks the 25th anniversary of the HKEX, underscoring our commitment to innovation and growth," he added.

    Reusable cup service needed at Kai Tak: Greenpeace

<img alt="Over 12,000 disposable items were distributed at the Lunar New Year Cup. Photo courtesy of Greenpeace" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790072_1_20250203172056.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A green group on Monday called on the government to build a reusable cup system at Kai Tak Sports Arena to reduce waste created at mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after Greenpeace conducted a study during the Lunar New Year Cup that attracted some 20,000 people at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They reviewed how many items of disposable cutlery and containers were given out among the five food vendors operating at the 16 shops which were open 45 minutes before the match started and during the intermission period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 12,000 disposable items were distributed during these time periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We used this data to amplify and estimate the number of disposable items that would be distributed by the Kai Tak sports centre in the coming year. We found that if there is a 100 percent occupancy rate [of 50,000 people] at 40 sports events yearly, there would be [more than] one million disposable items distributed to the audience,” said campaign officer Leanne Tam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said the predictions did not include disposable paper cups provided at the 20 water fountains during previous trial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group urged the administration to allocate HK$10 million to develop a reusable cup service in which spectators can return the cup after events for washing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam said such services are not new to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the 2019 Rugby Sevens, Hong Kong tried to implement the reusable cup service. Greenpeace has also implemented a community programme to provide reusable cups to cafes two years ago, and we have successfully saved over 10,000 cups with 50 cafes,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the government should take the lead in waste reduction and provide reusable cups for stores at the venue, so spectators can choose more environmentally friendly options.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beyoncé won Album of the Year for “Cowboy Carter” at the 2025 Grammys, delivering her — at last — the show’s elusive top award.
 <br>
  <br>
  The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been nominated in the category four times before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been many, many years,” Beyoncé said in her speech. “I want to dedicate this to Ms Martell,” she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The singer also emerged with the award for best country album for “Cowboy Carter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kendrick Lamar's culture-shifting diss track "Not Like Us" on Sunday took home the Grammy for Record of the Year, beating popular tracks from a crew of pop heavyweights to claim the prestigious prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chappell Roan won the 2025 best new artist Grammy award on Sunday, beating out fellow nominees including popular "Espresso" singer Sabrina Carpenter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among her hits, "Hot to Go!", helped cement her status as one of 2024 up and coming artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told myself that if I ever got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists offer a liveable wage," Roan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expressed her own experience as a minor that was signed by a record label and eventually dropped from that contract, leaving her unable to afford health insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We (music artists) got you, but do you got us?" she added
  <br>
  <br>
  Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, known professionally as Chappell Roan, was nominated in six Grammy categories this year, including song of the year for "Good Luck, Babe!" (Reuters)

    Ex-lawmaker Chim Pui-chung jailed for fraud

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung was on Monday sentenced to two years and 10 months in prison for conspiracy to defraud, over HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court earlier convicted Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky, who was the chairman, of conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement. Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger Chim was jailed for three years and one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Poe-lai, a businesswoman and an associate of Ma, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case and was jailed for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passing sentence, judge Ernest Lin said Chim Pui-chung and his son not only harmed the interests of individual investors, but also hurt the SAR’s reputation as an international finance centre and shook investor confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the starting point for the the former legislator's prison term was set at four years, and in reducing this to 34 months he had taken into account the defendant's old age and previous contributions to society, but also the damage he had caused.

    Hospital unveils 3D printed models to aid surgeons

<img alt="Researchers like Dr Victor Chan, right, are looking at creating more models to help surgeons practise different procedures. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790058_1_20250203120239.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital has introduced its latest 3D printed model of newborn babies' lungs to help doctors practise surgical intervention to treat pneumothorax, a condition when air accumulates in the pleural cavity which can collapse the lung and cause problems with heartbeat and breathing, in some cases becoming fatal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital says it has been working on these models using artificial intelligence along with the data of real patients including those from Computed Tomography (CT) scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make the models' texture more similar to real human skin and tissue, the research team also used data from pigs and chickens to help build the models.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital hopes the new 3D models will help doctors treat pneumothorax cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surgical intervention needs to be done promptly and swiftly especially for newborn babies whose conditions may deteriorate quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consultant for Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Dr Victor Chan explained that since the condition requires swift intervention, doctors need to be familiar with the procedure and have ample practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very complicated procedure, we need to follow the steps very meticulously, we can't risk the patient because of some inexperience or wrong steps. Therefore we need very good training on the doctors before we allow them to perform the procedure on a real patient," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the condition is not common, it can be hard for doctors to get hands-on experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that's why a simulation training, particularly on a nicely and beautifully made model, would be important," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger held prisoner and forced to work at a scam farm in Myanmar has been rescued and is back across the border in Thailand, SAR officials have confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's The Nation newspaper reported that the woman, 31, was freed on Sunday after the Thai police and army reached out to commanders of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army which controls an area south of Myawaddy in Myanmar where the woman was being detained by a "Chinese call-centre gang".
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent weeks, ransoms have been paid to secure the release of other Hongkongers being held captive in the region, but sources told RTHK that this was not the case this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Hong Kong's Security Bureau said a task force it set up in response to the detentions will "arrange for the individual's return to Hong Kong as soon as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the task force will "continue to actively assist and follow up on all relevant request-for-assistance cases of Hong Kong residents who have yet to return".
  <br>
  <br>
  Several SAR residents are still believed to be being held prisoner by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia.

 Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison has defended the jaw-dropping trade that sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, as a shell-shocked NBA struggled to comprehend the deal.

  In a seismic development that sent shockwaves rippling throughout the basketball world, news broke late on Saturday that the Mavs are trading away Doncic – a 25-year-old five-time All-Star – in exchange for Lakers big man Davis as part of a three-team deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extraordinary trade gives Dallas badly needed defensive heft with the acquisition of Davis, while the Lakers have at a stroke solved the riddle of how to prepare for life after LeBron James, the 40-year-old superstar who is the current face of the franchise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Davis, Doncic nor James were given advance warning that the deal was in the works, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that James first learned of the deal while out for dinner in New York with his family following the Lakers' victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first reaction to the move, Doncic took to social media to thank Dallas fans and looked forward to the next phase of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship," Doncic wrote in a letter to Mavs fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile saluted Davis's contribution to the Lakers in a caption over a photo of him embracing Davis on court. "Love you, my dog. Go crazy over there," James wrote, with a weeping emoji completing the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas executive Harrison defended the decision to offload Doncic amid an outcry from the franchise's fans on social media, insisting Davis's arrival could turn the Mavs into title contenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think defence wins championships and we're bringing in one of the best two-way players in the league," Harrison said. "We're excited to feel like we're built to win now as well as in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if he could understand the frustration of fans at seeing a generational talent being traded away, Harrison said he believes such a move would help "make the organisation better".
  <br>
  <br>
  In an inauspicious start to the post-Doncic era, the Mavs were blown out 144-101 by the NBA-leading Cleveland Cavaliers to fall to 26-24 on the season. (AFP)

<img alt="Researchers from Chinese University's medical school have found that pandemic babies had a higher risk of developing atopic diseases such as eczema.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have found that children born during the pandemic are more likely to have atopic diseases like eczema, and over-sanitisation was one of the reasons for this.
 <br>
  <br>
  They analysed data from 1,152 children born in Hong Kong, including 155 children born before the pandemic and 997 pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  They observed that there was a 46 percent increase in the incidence of allergy for pandemic babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The research team said excessive cleaning could hinder babies in their ability to develop healthy gut bacteria, which is crucial for children in building a strong immune system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gut dysbiosis would increase the chance of children of getting skin diseases like eczama.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the researchers, Professor Siew Ng, said lacking resistance genes, children may not have the immunity to combat different types of bacteria or bugs in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is becoming more and more common after the Covid-19 pandemic. We found there’s a 46 percent increase. I think part of the reason is because we are basically disinfecting too much. The hygiene measures are basically too stringent,” Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the tips we would give parents is to reduce or maybe to alleviate some of these atopic diseases is -- I think number one, is that it's important to be hygienic, but I think we shouldn't be over aggressive in our behaviour,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK says it has also developed two new oral probiotics, named SIM03 and SIM05, for children and adults with eczema respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their pilot studies found that after taking these probiotics for three months, their eczema symptoms were relieved and their sleep quality improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when the probiotics would be available for sale, Ng said the university would like to do a larger study on the use of the two probiotics in different population groups first.

    Aston Villa sign Rashford on loan from Man Utd

<img alt="Marcus Rashford is now on loan to Aston Villa. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790022_1_20250203070843.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United for the rest of the season to end the England international's exile under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Once a hero for the United fans, Rashford has not featured for his boyhood club since December 12 and admitted earlier this season he was ready for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old had been linked with a move to AC Milan and Barcelona, but the European giants were put off by his reported US$372,000 a week wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Sky Sports, Villa will pick up at least 75 percent of that pay packet for the coming months, rising to 90 percent depending on performance-related bonuses and have an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions," said Rashford in a Villa statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to play football and am excited to get started," he added. "I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa moved to bolster their attacking options after selling Colombia striker Jhon Duran to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unai Emery's men have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League and still have aspirations to qualify for that tournament again next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit eighth in the Premier League, eight points above 13th-placed United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford scored 138 goals in 426 appearances since coming through the ranks at Old Trafford and has lifted the Europa League, two FA Cups and two League Cups as a United player.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, his attitude and work ethic in training has been questioned by Amorim, since he took charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  After last weekend's 1-0 win at Fulham, the Portuguese coach sensationally claimed he would rather put the club's 63-year-old goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in the squad than Rashford.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our team should be so much better with Rashford, but he has to change," Amorim said last week. "If he does change, we are more than welcome to put a talent like Rashford in, and we need it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in this moment I think it's really clear that we have to set some standards. That's all."
  <br>
  <br>
  A temporary switch to Villa allows Rashford a fresh start to rehabilitate his tarnished reputation after his astonishing fall from grace.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was part of England's World Cup squad just over two years ago and scored a career-best 30 goals in the 2022 to 2023 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he netted just eight times last season and has seven in 24 appearances so far this campaign. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal beat Manchester City 5-1 to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, while Manchester United slumped to another meek 2-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the battle between the top two for the past two seasons, the Gunners prevailed to move within six points of leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a great day for us, especially with the necessity that we had to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were gifted the perfect start inside two minutes as Manuel Akanji lost possession and Kai Havertz squared for Martin Odegaard to open the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland headed in his 250th career club goal early in the second half to bring City level.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defending champions are a pale shadow of their former selves this season and conceded within 105 seconds of the restart when Thomas Partey's shot deflected in off John Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's happened all season, we are giving away too many things," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "You cannot lose the control, it's 95 minutes. You cannot finish in the way we played."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly would have been suspended if his controversial red card in a 1-0 win at Wolves last weekend had not been overturned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old made the most of that reprieve by curling in Arsenal's third for his first goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz fired low and hard into the far corner with City cut open at will by the Arsenal counter-attack on 76 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  And another Arsenal teenager rounded off the rout when Ethan Nwaneri curled home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves City still in fourth but now 15 points off the top and realistically dethroned after four consecutive seasons as champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean Philippe-Mateta was Palace's hero with both goals in the second half as United suffered a fifth defeat in their last six home league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory takes the Eagles above the Red Devils in the table as Oliver Glasner's side climb to 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three consecutive wins for United had lifted the mood around Old Trafford but it was back to square one for Ruben Amorim after another home display lacking in creativity and riddled with defensive lapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace showed no mercy to secure the three points when Daniel Muñoz charged through the middle of the home side's defence and unselfishly squared for Mateta to knock in his sixth goal in five games. (AFP)

    Rubio meets Panama leader on Trump demands for canal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio entered talks on Sunday with Panama's leader to press President Donald Trump's demand that the United States take back control of the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has refused to back down on threats to seize the vital waterway and it remains unclear what Rubio can achieve diplomatically that would please him, with Panama firmly rejecting any claims against its sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, in his first meeting abroad as the top US diplomat, walked past an honor guard outside the whitewashed walls of President Jose Raul Mulino's official residence in the tropical capital's old quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio shook hands with Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha and flashed a thumbs-up sign before heading into talks with Mulino. They made no immediate comments to the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio later in the day will tour the Panama Canal, the crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through which some 40 percent of US container traffic passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Rubio claim that China has gained too much power around the canal and could shut it down in a potential conflict, with catastrophic consequences for the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said that Panama has "totally violated" the understanding when the United States handed back the canal in late 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've already offered to do many things," Trump said Friday of Panama, "but we think it's appropriate that we take it back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scattered protests broke out in Panama ahead of Rubio's visit, with an effigy of him in a red, white and blue suit set on fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diojenes Sanchez, a professor who took part in the protests, vowed to defend Panama's sovereignty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We firmly reject the claims of the United States to turn Panama into a protectorate and colony," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which Trump has dubbed as a modern "wonder of the world", was built by the United States at the cost of thousands of lives of laborers, mostly people of African descent from Barbados, Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States maintained control of the canal when it opened in 1914 but began to negotiate following deadly riots in 1964 by Panamanians angered over foreign control. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia captain Sam Kerr is slated to face trial in London starting on Monday (February 3) on charges of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea forward Kerr, one of the world's most recognisable women's soccer players and a sporting idol in her home nation, was charged in January 2024, almost a year after the incident was alleged to have occurred in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charge relates to an incident involving a police officer on 30 January 2023 in Twickenham, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr, 31, has pleaded not guilty and the trial at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court is expected to last four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr is Australia's all-time top scorer. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge saw a surge in travellers over Lunar New Year, officials say, with the number passing through the Zhuhai port hitting a record high on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border inspection authorities said 156,000 inbound and outbound passenger trips were made through that port on the third day of the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since the facility opened in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday to Friday, more than 454,000 passenger trips were recorded through the port, marking a 22 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department warned that it expected a large number of vehicles to use the bridge between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Zhuhai said people were having to wait more than 40 minutes for inspections on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said he expects Hong Kong interest rates will remain high for some time because of the tariffs the US has imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  An executive order from US President Donald Trump on Saturday introduced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports, with a rate of 25 percent for the other two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the tariffs will hurt Americans more than anyone else because the extra costs incurred will be passed on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the resulting inflationary pressures in the US will also affect Hong Kong, he warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their inflation stays high, that should also affect us. Because after all, with the dollar peg, when US interest rates are high, rates in Hong Kong should also be high," Chan said on Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adds to the burden of business and affects the business environment and to a degree adds constraints to asset markets. These are things that we have to fully consider."

  Chan said the SAR government has made plans to deal with potential Trump policies, describing the president's governance style as "rather extreme at times".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lakers and Mavericks on Sunday sent the NBA world into a frenzy, with multiple US media reporting that the teams had completed a trade that will send Luka Doncic to Los Angeles and Anthony Davis to Dallas.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN, which first reported the news, said while the two stars are at the center of the deal, the Lakers will also get Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris, and the Mavericks will receive Max Christie and a 2029 first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media outlet reported that the Jazz are also involved in the trade and will get Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round draft pick via the Los Angeles Clippers from the Lakers. Dallas is also sending a 2025 second-round selection to Utah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that defense wins championships," Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN. "I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We're built to win now and in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas came to the Lakers offering Doncic, and Los Angeles reportedly believed that the five-time All-Star has what it takes to someday be the face of the franchise, per ESPN. For now, he will be playing alongside LeBron James, who is in his 22nd NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was not informed that such a deal was coming, and Doncic, Davis, and players and a number of coaches on both sides were also left in the dark, according to ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Doncic and Davis are currently sidelined due to injuries, as are Kleber and Hood-Schifino. Doncic hasn't played since Christmas Day due to a strained left calf, while Davis just went down on Tuesday with an abdominal muscle strain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no set date for Doncic's return, but when the 25-year-old first hit the shelf, the Mavericks said he would be re-evaluated in about one month. Davis will be re-evaluated sometime next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists in 22 games (all starts) this season. He has played only for Dallas in his seven-year NBA career after being selected third overall by the Hawks in the 2018 draft. Atlanta sent his draft rights to the Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old Davis has put up averages of 25.7 points, 11.9 boards, 3.4 assists and 2.1 blocks across 42 games (all starts) during the 2024-25 campaign. He is a 10-time All-Star (including this season), five-time All-NBA selection and five-time All-Defensive Team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before reports of the trade emerged, the Lakers were fifth in the Western Conference at 28-19, while the Mavericks were three spots below them in eighth at 26-23. (Reuters)

    'Subsidies for the elderly must be retained'
   </title>

<img alt="The Society for Community Organisation says subsidies for the elderly should be protected. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789976_1_20250202154040.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Community activists are urging Financial Secretary Paul Chan to ring-fence spending on support for elderly people and look elsewhere as he seeks to balance the books.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) invited lawmakers Andrew Lam, Lam Chun-sing, David Lam and Tik Chi-yuen to a sharing session on Sunday to hear public concerns about living expenses, including worries about possible changes to a scheme that allows the over 60s to use public transport for just HK$2 per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Hau, aged 64, said he hopes the government won't bump the minimum age for the subsidised fares back up to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I work as a security guard. Sometimes I have to go all the way to Tuen Mun from Sham Shui Po for work. Scrapping the HK$2 subsidy would add to my burden,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m working hard, but I would be getting less assistance from the government. Is the government trying to encourage people not to work?”
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Tik said the travel subsidy has boosted elderly people's social mobility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more elderly people going out to work, they are volunteering in the community. This can improve their health in general, which is creating value for society. With better health, the elderly will not need to rely on the public medical system, or other social assistance that much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo said while it understands the government needs to cut back on spending to address a budget deficit, it is important that a range of subsidies are protected, including the carer allowance and community healthcare schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other elderly people invited to the sharing session spoke of the financial difficulties they face, even with the subsidies provided by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I skip my meals to save up money. I haven’t eaten once in the past two days," said a woman surnamed Chin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile a woman in her seventies told the lawmakers that she struggled to look after her health while also caring for her husband who is bedbound.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been suffering from body aches [from taking care of my husband]. It's also hard for us to get to the doctor as taxis often do not want to take customers in a wheelchair. My doctor told me to get an MRI scan, but I don’t have money for that,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman said she is not eligible for a carer allowance of up to HK$3,000 because she gets Comprehensive Social Security Assistance and the Old Age Living Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lam Chun-sing said the government should consider relaxing the eligibility requirements for the carer allowance so people in the woman's situation can receive a portion of the subsidy.

    Football fans to raise the roof in Kai Tak sound check

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 How noisy 50,000 excited football fans can get will be put to the test this week as the roof of the main stadium is retracted for the first time in a series of trial runs at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say the stadium will be packed on Tuesday for a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing on Sunday, sports commissioner George Tsoi said opening the roof will allow the Environmental Protection Department to check how much of a noise nuisance events at the stadium could potentially pose to residents of nearby areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials also want to see how opening the roof affects the experience of those inside the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time when we had a sports event in early January, we found that the overall ambience, when the retractable roof was closed, was very good. Because when the audience were cheering for their teams, the sound effects were very good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we are going to open the retractable roof to see how the ambience, as well as other production effects, would be going on in sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said they also want to see how easy it is for 50,000 people to leave the stadium after an event, with services on the MTR's Tuen Ma and Kwun Tong lines to be enhanced and 10 special bus services to be laid on for the test event.

    Public agree changes needed over HK$2 fares: Paul Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is broad public agreement that changes have to be made to Hong Kong's HK$2 transport fares for the over 60s, Paul Chan said on Sunday, as he suggested healthcare and education could also be in line for government spending cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a Commercial Radio programme, the financial secretary said the intentions behind the HK$2 scheme were very good, but the expenses involved have been mounting since the eligible age was lowered from the original 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there's a public consensus that the current scheme isn't financially sustainable over the long run, if no changes are made to it. So how should we change it?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are so many different views. We're collecting them and then officials will assess them and discuss them internally. We're all looking at different proposals in detail."
  <br>
  <br>
  With his budget speech coming up on February 26, Chan said there is room to save money in areas including education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said universities have relatively large amounts of reserves, adding that everyone can play their part in the next couple of years to tackle the government's budget deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said, however, that the government will minimise the effects of expenditure cuts on the public.

    'Canada will hit US with retaliatory tariffs Tuesday'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada will hit back at US tariffs with 25 percent levies of its own on select American goods, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25 percent tariffs against Can$155 billion (US$106 billion) worth of American goods," he said in a dramatic tone as he warned of a fracture in longstanding Canada-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first round of tariffs would target Can$30 billion worth of US goods on Tuesday followed by further tariffs on Can$125 billion worth of products in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're certainly not looking to escalate. But we will stand up for Canada, for Canadians, for Canadian jobs," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs will apply to "everyday items" such as American beer, wine and bourbon as well as fruits, vegetables, consumer appliances, lumber and plastics, he added -- "with much, much more."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, citing a threat from illegal immigration and drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian exports to the United States will face a 25 percent tariff starting Tuesday, although energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said the trade conflict will have "real consequences" for Canadians but also for Americans, including job losses, higher costs for food and gasoline, potential shutdowns of auto assembly plants, and impeded access to Canadian nickel, potash, uranium, steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  He offered a reminder that Canada has been at the US's side in its "darkest hours" from the Iran hostage crisis and war in Afghanistan, to deadly natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the recent California wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're always there, standing with you," Trudeau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If President Trump wants to usher in a new golden age for the United States, the better path is to partner with Canada, not to punish us."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trudeau consulted with provincial premiers, who each said afterward that they would take additional measures such as taking US booze off local store shelves and seeking to immediately diversify their trade relationships. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Sunday that it "firmly opposes" new tariffs imposed on Beijing by US President Donald Trump, vowing to take "corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  Unveiling sweeping measures against major trade partners on Saturday, Trump announced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce slammed Washington's "erroneous practices", saying Beijing was "strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said Beijing would file a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization, arguing that "the unilateral imposition of tariffs by the United States seriously violates WTO rules".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the duties were "not only unhelpful in solving the US' own problems, but also undermine normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China hopes that the United States will objectively and rationally view and deal with its own issues like fentanyl, rather than threatening other countries with tariffs at every turn," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Beijing "urges the US to correct its erroneous practices, meet China halfway, face up to its problems, have frank dialogues, strengthen cooperation and manage differences on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect". (AFP)

    Straka captures narrow lead at Pebble Beach

<img alt="Sepp Straka (left) fist-bumps Russell Henley during the third round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789953_1_20250202084218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Straka birdied four of the last five holes to grab a one-stroke lead over Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry after Saturday's third round of the PGA Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
 <br>
  <br>
  The famed oceanside layout was struck by gusting winds, heavy rains and cold conditions for much of the day but Straka rallied for a two-under 70 to stand on 16-under-par 200 while McIlroy and Lowry battled through to shoot seven-under-par 65s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's Straka, who stumbled out of the lead with three bogeys to start the back nine, closed his late run with a four-foot birdie putt at the par-5 18th to regain the top spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bit of a roller coaster out there," Straka said. "Things got pretty tough. Wind. Rain. I didn't handle them too well. Struggled all day with speed on the greens because of the wind. Didn't adjust really well until the last few holes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Straka, who won his third PGA Tour title just two weeks ago at the American Express event, opened with back-to-back birdies. But his second shot at the 10th faded right over a cliff and onto the beach to start a three-bogey run.
  <br>
  <br>
  He answered with birdie putts at 14 and 15, sank a 29-foot birdie putt at the par-3 17th, then blasted out of a bunker to four feet at 18 and sank the putt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really proud of the way I stuck it out and came back to get some birdies coming in. Hit some really big putts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time major winner McIlroy birdied three of the last four holes and 2019 British Open champion Lowry birdied three of the final five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got really squally around seven, eight nine 10 for us. For me to play those holes at even par was huge," McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then it started to settle and it's a little more sheltered on the back nine and it was nice to pick up a few birdies on the way in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry had seven birdies, two bogeys and an eagle but battled conditions much of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shot a good score but it was pretty miserable out there at times," said Lowry. "It was very important to birdie the easy holes because the hard holes were really hard."
  <br>
  <br>
  England's Justin Rose and South Korea's Tom Kim each shot 68 to share fourth on 202 with Australian Cam Davis, who shot 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern Ireland's McIlroy seeks his 27th career PGA Tour triumph while Irish pal Lowry seeks his fourth PGA victory and first since he and McIlroy combined for last April's pairs crown at New Orleans.

  <br>
  "Let's hope one of us does the business," Lowry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hopes for a rare California triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow would be big for a lot of reasons," McIlroy said. "It's exciting to try and get my first win of the season. Historically, the West Coast hasn't been that good for me. Haven't played great at this golf course."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-ranked McIlroy birdied four of the first eight holes to make his early charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He dropped his approach inside three feet at the 15th and tapped in for birdie, then sank a 26-foot birdie putt at 16 to grab the lead alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him with a birdie putt from just inside 17 feet at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hit the week's longest drive at the par-5 18th, 346 yards, then dropped his approach just inside 35 feet and two-putted to grab the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him at the top again with a birdie at 18, blasting out of a greenside bunker to just outside seven feet and sinking the putt for the last of four back-nine birdies. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah scored twice to take Liverpool nine points clear at the top of the Premier League by beating Bournemouth 2-0 on Saturday, while third-placed Nottingham Forest smashed Brighton 7-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah's double took him above Frank Lampard as the sixth highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 178 goals on another significant day in the Reds' charge towards a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth had not lost in 12 games in all competitions and beaten Arsenal and Manchester City at home earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cherries can count themselves unfortunate not to have extended that run as they hit the woodwork either side of half-time through Antoine Semenyo and Marcus Tavernier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth were also furious over the awarding of a penalty that opened the scoring on the half hour mark as Cody Gakpo appeared to clip his own heels as he entered the box rather than being tripped by Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  VAR did not intervene to overturn referee Darren England's original decision to point to the spot and Salah ruthlessly rifled home the resulting spot-kick for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth pressed in vain for an equaliser after the break as the in-form Justin Kluivert missed two big chances either side of Tavernier's strike off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one moment of magic from Salah sealed a massive three points in the title race when he cut inside onto his favoured left foot and curled into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels good to be scoring goals, to be winning, but my main target this season is to win the Premier League with the team so we must keep going," said Salah, whose future at Anfield beyond this season remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have a mountain to climb if they are to rein in Arne Slot's men and host defending champions Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest moved level on points with the Gunners thanks to a scintillating performance that blew Brighton away at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's men had been beaten 5-0 by Bournemouth last weekend but bounced back in style with Chris Wood netting a hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White, Neco Williams and Jota Silva were also on target for Forest after Lewis Dunk's own goal opened the floodgates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After what happened last week, the answer was good," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "You get punched, you get up - fantastic!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-time European champions are on course for a place in the Champions League as they opened up a six-point cushion on fifth-placed Newcastle, who blew the lead to lose 2-1 at home to Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Murphy put the Magpies in front at St. James' Park, but Fulham hit back thanks to goals from Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz to climb up to ninth and within four points of the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's relegation fears in their final season at Goodison Park now appear over after thrashing Leicester 4-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure opened the scoring after just 10 seconds as David Moyes enjoyed a third win in his first four games since returning as Everton boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beto then took advantage of some woeful Leicester defending to score twice before half-time and Iliman Ndiaye rounded off a resounding win in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three at Leicester's expense thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde's strike to beat Aston Villa 1-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, who reached the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, have now failed to win seven consecutive times after a European game to dent their chances of returning to the competition next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich look doomed after Southampton ended their wait for a league win since November with a 2-1 victory at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Onuachu scored the winner three minutes from time for Saints, who are still 10 points adrift of safety, but move to with seven of second-bottom Ipswich. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is in for an exciting year filled with major events.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on social media after attending the Lunar New Year Cup football match at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday night, Chan praised both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Hong Kong Legends and World Legends teams had delivered entertaining games, featuring impressive goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was drawn 3-3 at full time, but the World Legends won a penalty shoot-out 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He praised the lively atmosphere at the stadium, where around 20,000 fans turned up for the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the game - featuring top international players and local soccer stars - was the perfect way for local and visiting soccer fans to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen authorities are investigating an explosion near the Man Kam To control point on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they believe an oxygen tank on a lorry ruptured shortly past 7:30 in the evening, causing an explosion and a fire that was caught on a video and went viral on mainland social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was injured, and the fire was put out within around half an hour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Legends football team on Saturday evening did the SAR proud by holding the World Legends team to a 3-3 draw at full-time at the Hong Kong Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an entertaining encounter - littered with errors - the World Legends team had to claw their way back from 3-1 down to spare their own blushes. They went on to win the penalty shootout by 6 goals to 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Kanglian scored the first goal for the Hong Kong Legends in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven minutes later, Ryan Giggs, who had a stellar career with Manchester United in the English Premier League, tied the score at 1-1 for the World Legends.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in first-half stoppage time, Li scored again to give the Hong Kong Legends a 2-1 lead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 4 minutes after the break, Ju Yingzhi made it 3-1 to the Hong Kong Legends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Legends piled on the pressure, and in the 75th minute, Luis Garcia headed in to reduce the deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 88th minute, Garcia scored again from point-blank range, and the game went to penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams scored their first five spot-kicks and the shootout went to "sudden death." Kaka of the World Legends scored the next penalty, but Lu Junyi missed, and the World Legends took the trophy.

    Unjabbed 19-month-old boy in intensive care with flu

<img alt="The Centre for Health Protection is calling on parents to make sure their kids get vaccinated. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789926_1_20250201204812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection on Saturday said a 19-month-old boy is in critical condition after being infected with influenza A. He was clinically diagnosed with influenza A complicated by severe pneumonia and is still hospitalised.
 <br>
  <br>
  He has not received the seasonal influenza vaccine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the flu season began in Hong Kong last month, a total of nine cases of severe influenza virus infections in children have been reported. Seven of the children had not been vaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities say they expect influenza activity to increase further, and the activity of other respiratory infectious diseases may also increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said that in this latest case, the boy had been in good health before, but has had a fever and cough since Thursday. He was taken to the Baptist Hospital for treatment yesterday and subsequently transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is currently still in the paediatric intensive care unit. The boy did not travel abroad during the incubation period and his home contacts have no symptoms at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre said that as of January 26, the seasonal influenza vaccination rate for children aged six months to under two years old was still low, at about 20.9 percent. Although it has increased slightly compared to the same period last year, it is still lower than the vaccination rate of children in other age groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre again called on people who have not yet received the seasonal flu jab to take immediate action, to reduce the risk of severe illness and death. The CHP also reiterated its call for all parents to make sure their children have been vaccinated.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said it is inappropriate to simply look at projected unit completion as the total supply volume for private flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the government announced that some 107,000 private units may be available for sale in the coming three to four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her Facebook page, Ho said she is aware of online discussions about the number being overly optimistic and that there might not be that many flats available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho explained that the figure includes completed units that are still unsold, units currently being built, and those whose construction hasn't started yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing minister stressed that the administration has been consistent in how they release data, and such information can be traced back for more than a decade to avoid confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted that nearly 19,000 private flats had been completed each year over the past five years, saying this shows the government’s success in balancing demand and supply.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia thrashed Sri Lanka by an innings and 242 runs on day four of the opening test in Galle on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Electing to bat, Australia amassed 654-6 declared in their first innings to take charge of the series opener at the Galle International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They bundled out Sri Lanka for 165 in the first innings with Matthew Kuhnemann (5-63) leading the rout on a spin-friendly track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Made to follow on, Sri Lanka were all out for 247 to succumb to their heaviest-ever Test defeat. Jeffrey Vandersay (53) was the top scorer for Sri Lanka before being the last man out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Kuhnemann took four wickets apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second test begins on Thursday. (Reuters)

<img alt="The hole was initially around five metres in diameter but has combined with a larger cavity that opened during the rescue operation on Tuesday night. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789923_2_20250201191209.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese rescuers completed building a slope on Saturday to reach a truck driver stuck in a sinkhole, officials said, four days after his vehicle was swallowed by the cavity now 40 metres wide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers have been struggling with the operation as the hole – now the length of an Olympic swimming pool – expands since opening up on Tuesday in Yashio city, on the outskirts of Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just completed the work on the ramp," Saitama regional governor Motohiro Ono told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers will use the 30-metre slope to send heavy equipment into the hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to clear the debris and rescue the driver as soon as possible," Ono said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soil and debris covering the cabin of the 74-year-old driver have prevented any communication with him since midday on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Groundwater leaking into the sinkhole was mostly stopped on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the walls of the hole – around 15 metres deep, according to NHK – eroding, rescue workers are unable to stay inside it for long.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole was initially around five metres in diameter but combined with a larger cavity that opened during the rescue operation on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy chunks of asphalt have fallen inside, making it difficult for rescue workers and heavy machinery to go near the chasm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1.2 million people living in the area have been asked to cut back on showers and laundry to prevent leaking sewage from hindering the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,600 cases of road sinkholes in 2022 were caused by sewer pipes, according to local media. Most were small, at only 50 centimetres deep or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2016, a giant sinkhole around 30 metres wide and 15 metres deep appeared on a busy street in Fukuoka city, triggered by nearby subway construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt and the street reopened a week after workers toiled around the clock. (AFP)

<img alt="Thousands of homes were destroyed by the Eaton Fire in the Altadena neighbourhood of Los Angeles County. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789917_1_20250201181526.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two devastating wildfires in Los Angeles were declared fully contained by firefighters on Friday after burning for more than three weeks, killing about 30 people and displacing thousands more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Palisades and Eaton fires in Southern California's Los Angeles County were the most destructive in the history of the second-largest US city, burning more than 37,000 acres (150 square kilometres) and over 10,000 homes, causing damage estimated to cost hundreds of billions of US dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cal Fire, the state's firefighting agency, updated the figures on its website on Friday to show 100 percent containment of both fires, meaning their perimeters were completely under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders were lifted earlier, with the fires not posing a serious threat for days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both blazes started on January 7 and their exact cause remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But human-driven climate change set the stage for the infernos by reducing rainfall, parching vegetation, and extending the dangerous overlap between flammable drought conditions and powerful Santa Ana winds, according to an analysis published this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, conducted by dozens of researchers, concluded that the conditions fuelling the blazes were approximately 35 percent more likely due to global warming caused by burning fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two fires destroyed thousands of structures over more than three weeks in the affluent Pacific Palisades neighbourhood of Los Angeles and Malibu, and in the Altadena community in Los Angeles County, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our recovery effort is based around getting people back home to rebuild as quickly and safely as possible," Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement on Friday. "We are making sure that the Palisades will be safe as residents access their properties."
  <br>
  <br>
  City police chief Jim McDonnell said the presence of law enforcement officers in the area would be "more than 10 times" what it was before the start of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private meteorological firm AccuWeather has estimated the damage and economic loss at between US$250 billion and US$275 billion. (AFP)

    Sports dispute resolution scheme to start this year

<img alt="Horace Cheung says the pilot scheme will be rolled out in the latter half of 2025. File Photo courtesy of Horace Cheung's Facebook page" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789901_1_20250201164819.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung revealed on Saturday that the pilot scheme for sports dispute resolution will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was first unveiled in the Policy Address last year with the aim of promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung told a television programme that the scheme will run for two to three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is not mandatory for subvented sports associations to participate in the test run, he said they are highly encouraged to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes sports groups can improve their governance by joining the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can show the public that when they have internal issues that cannot be resolved, they are willing to solve them through a fair and open system which has good value for money," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not expensive and won't take much time. And it won't hinder the development of elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung noted that athletes participating in the Olympics have limited time and have to undergo intensive training.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the matter is dealt with in court, the athletes will lose the chance to participate in the competition due to ongoing legal procedures, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deputy justice chief pointed out that the arbitration rules will be set up by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will look for a suitable arbitration body in the coming months, which has to be experienced and have close contact with the sports industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will subsidise part of the cost of arbitration during the test run, he added.

    Small plane crashes in Philadelphia, sparking blaze

<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical jet with six Mexican nationals on board crashed into a busy Philadelphia neighbourhood on Friday, authorities said, marking another US aviation disaster after a passenger plane and a military helicopter collided mid-air in Washington earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Video footage appeared to show the twin-engine plane descending at a sharp angle towards a residential area, sparking a huge fireball upon impact and showering wreckage over homes and vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the aircraft was a Learjet 55 – an American-French business jet – that had taken off shortly before from Northeast Philadelphia Airport bound for Branson, Missouri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash happened just after 6:00 pm (2300 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  A young girl who had been in the United States for medical care, her mother, and members of the flight and medical crews accompanying her on board were killed in the crash, said the children's hospital that had treated her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The patient had received care from Shriners Children's Philadelphia and was being transported back to her home country in Mexico on a contracted air ambulance when the crash happened," said Mel Bower, a spokesman for Shriners Children's.
  <br>
  <br>
  All six of those on board were Mexican citizens, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airline company... confirmed to the consulate that six people of Mexican nationality were travelling on the aircraft," the ministry wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator, Jet Rescue Air Ambulance, confirmed in a statement to US media that there were two passengers and four crew, adding, "At this time, we cannot confirm any survivors."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of emergency workers were on the scene outside Roosevelt Mall, a strip mall in Northeast Philadelphia with retailers and food outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump posted on Friday on his Truth Social platform that he was "sad" to see "more souls lost" in the Philadelphia tragedy. He praised first responders, adding: "God Bless you all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told local TV crews that they saw body parts in or near the wreckage, as Philadelphia City Council member Mike Driscoll said he feared residents or others on the ground may have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good. And it's a sad situation here," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it was launching an investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board. (AFP)

<img alt="Victor Wembanyama nails a three-pointer during the second half. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789894_1_20250201152458.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victor Wembanyama scored 30 points as the San Antonio Spurs produced their highest-scoring game of the season in a 144-118 blowout against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  French prodigy Wembanyama was in superb form at both ends of the court, hauling down 14 rebounds and making six blocks while draining five-of-11 attempts from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama received plenty of scoring support from the Spurs lineup, with all of the starting five finishing with double-digit points tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephon Castle scored 20 points while Harrison Barnes added 16, with Keldon Johnson chipping in with 24 off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee's scoring with 35 points while Damian Lillard finished with 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the headlines belonged to Wembanyama, the former number 1 draft pick who once again displayed the sort of form that has earned him a call-up to next month's NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could feel like everybody was tired of losing," Wembanyama said afterwards. "So we didn't let go the whole game. The game was consistently hard, but there wasn't a moment where we let them go on huge runs. So I hope we can get inspired by that."
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio's caretaker head coach, Mitch Johnson, praised Wembanyama's influence in marshalling the Spurs defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought Victor was quarterbacking the defence tonight with his communication," Johnson said. "That's another level for him. He does so many tremendous plays with his talent and unique skill set. When he starts using his voice as a skill and connecting our defence as a team – it takes it to another level."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Friday, a late burst of scoring from Nikola Jokic helped the Denver Nuggets overcome a 42-point display from Tyrese Maxey to dig out a hard-earned 137-134 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbian star Jokic just missed out on adding to his season tally of 21 triple-doubles, finishing with 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, but helped Denver get over the line by reeling off eight points late in the fourth quarter to settle a pulsating duel that saw the lead change hands no fewer than 16 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuggets guard Jamal Murray was in scintillating form for Denver, finishing with 31 points, while Michael Porter Jr added 24 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maxey meanwhile was left empty-handed after another talismanic performance that included making six-of-11 from beyond the arc. Guerschon Yabusele backed Maxey with 28 points, with Kelly Oubre Jr scoring 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets improved to 29-19 with the win and remain fourth in the Western Conference, nine games behind leaders Oklahoma City. Philadelphia fell to 19-28 and are sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference table, just outside the postseason places.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New Orleans, meanwhile, Jayson Tatum's jump shot with 0.2 seconds remaining handed the Boston Celtics a thrilling 118-116 victory over the Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum finished with 27 points while Jaylen Brown led Boston's scoring with 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Cade Cunningham poured in 40 points to inspire the Detroit Pistons to a 117-102 defeat of the Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After rattling in 18 points in the first half, Cunningham erupted for 16 in the third quarter before adding six more in the fourth as Detroit closed out the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobias Harris added 17 points while Jalen Duren finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and five assists for Detroit, who improved to 24-24 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrie Irving with 28 points led the scoring for Dallas, who were once again without the injured Luka Doncic. The Mavs fell to 26-23 following the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers made it two wins out of two on their three-game road trip with a 112-104 defeat of the Hornets. (AFP)

    Hamas hands two more hostages over to Red Cross

<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militant group Hamas handed over two Israeli hostages to the Red Cross, live television images showed on Saturday, with a third expected to be transferred later in the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ofer Kalderon, a French-Israeli dual national and Yarden Bibas were seen being handed over to a Red Cross official in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, in the latest stage of a phased exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel is expected to be handed over in another location later on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bibas is the father of the two youngest hostages, baby Kfir, only 9 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen on October 7, 2023, and Ariel, who was 4 at the time of the cross-border attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that the boys and their mother Shiri, who was taken at the same time, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. There has been no word on them since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel is expected to transfer 182 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Hamas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday is also expected to see the first Palestinians travelling from Gaza to Egypt through the newly reopened Rafah crossing. It will be opened initially for 50 injured militants and 50 wounded civilians, along with the people escorting them, with a further 100 people, most likely students, probably allowed through on humanitarian grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen of the 33 hostages due for release in the first stage of the ceasefire have now been released in exchange for 400 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations are due to start by Tuesday on agreements for the release of more than 60 remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial six-week ceasefire, agreed with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, has so far stayed on track despite a number of incidents that have led both sides to accuse the other of violating the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack on October 7, 2023, Hamas killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in response has destroyed much of the densely populated Gaza Strip and killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities. (Reuters)

  Starting the next academic year, the government will hike the current tuition fees of HK$42,100 for eight public universities by just under 18 percent in phased increases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fees have been frozen for almost three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi told an RTHK radio programme that she believes the move will not affect the universities’ teaching, research and attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For most of the time, apart from relying on government funding as their source of income, the institutions have also had donations. And besides undergraduate programmes, they've taught postgraduate programmes which consist of more self-financing students,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Universities have different sources of income. Of course, funding will have some impact on them. But we note that they also have relatively sound reserves or financial management.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the institutions will have sufficient time to make arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi also revealed that the government has no plan to gradually increase the tuition fees of non-local students until it's recovered all costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that Singapore is charging non-local students between HK$100,000 and HK$200,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said that if the SAR hiked fees to more than HK$300,000, local universities will not be able to attract top talent.

 Preliminary figures for the Lunar New Year point to a rebound in tourist numbers, including overseas visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said on Saturday that Hong Kong attracted close to 680,000 tourists from Tuesday to Friday, a 6 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board's executive director Dane Cheng told a Commercial Radio programme that the percentage increase for overseas visitors was even better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From Lunar New Year Eve to Thursday, there was a 12 percent year-on-year increase. People might feel that the vibe is better because most of them congregated in the tourist hot spots,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hiked to the Peak with my family [on Friday], and it was super crowded. There were people in every mall and restaurant, and the Peak tram station was packed with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  There were more than 560,000 mainland visitors in the first four days of their eight-day Golden Week holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said he expects more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong in the coming days, noting many of them might have been spending time with their families earlier in the holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that about half of the inbound tourists stayed overnight, and most hotels were nearly fully booked
