<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said new construction technologies can speed up housing projects and that residents living in substandard subdivided flats will not go homeless amid policy changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided flats last year, saying they will be replaced by basic housing units, each of which must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Ho said residents of substandard subdivided units do not have to worry about relocations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's say one third of the subdivided flats have to be redesigned," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the supply of public housing units will increase in the future, and we will have 21,000 transitional flats and 30,000 light public flats
  <br>
  <br>
  "These flats will help to accommodate some 30,000 households in subdivided flats who have to be relocated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she believes new construction technologies can help speed up housing projects, such as the modular integrated construction method being used to build transitional housing and light public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said she has had exchanges with experts on the mainland and that their new technologies could help the construction sector of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more and more robotic arms being used," she pointed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Light public housing are structural steel projects, so welding is an important procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Robotic arms are used for welding, and the efficiency, accuracy and safety are a lot better than doing it manually."

    HK exporters 'furious over Trump tariffs'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A commercial-sector lawmaker said on Wednesday US President Donald Trump's tariffs on China are an act of bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump will impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese imports at around noon Hong Kong time on top of 54 percent levies, bringing the total to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam, who is also an executive councillor, told an RTHK radio programme that manufacturers and exporters in Hong Kong who mainly do businesses with the United States were furious about the move and felt powerless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies now face a situation where they have many batches of completed goods that cannot be shipped, and they're unable to collect payment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because, normally speaking, when a customer places an order, companies can only collect payment when the goods have been shipped and have a shipping order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As they cannot collect the payment, there is a great impact on their cash flow."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that companies have to be united and not be cowed, saying that will get them through this difficult period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam pointed out that firms have reached a critical point, as they still have to settle operating costs, such as wages and rents amid their cash-flow struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker called on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to roll out measures to help support small and medium-sized companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include extending a payments moratorium on principals for 12 months and offering flexible arrangements for firms to repay loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even though the industry has been trading in the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets in the past two years, Lam said combined sales from the two places are still lower than US turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that opening up new markets takes time and that they won't be able to replace the US market at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Willy Lin, chairman of Hong Kong Shippers' Council told the same programme that companies in Hong Kong cannot do much even if they have already set up factories in various places, like Southeast Asia, as many of those countries have been  hit by Trump's levies.

<img alt="HKTDC's Irina Fan says Hong Kong's diversified trade links will help it withstand any pressure from new US tariffs. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799560_1_20250409111312.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leung Chai-yan, the elder daughter of former SAR chief executive CY Leung, has died at the age of 33.
 <br>
  <br>
  Confirming the news on social media early on Wednesday, the former SAR leader said his daughter passed away "very suddenly".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Chai-yan "left without saying a word" and passed away peacefully in bed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thanks to police and forensic investigations, we can rule out suicide and other suspicious circumstances at the moment," Leung wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are grateful for the concern, understanding and sympathy from all our friends during this most difficult time for our family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report of a woman found unresponsive at a Shau Kei Wan serviced apartment complex on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman was certified dead at the scene, according to the force.

    Zverev suffers shock exit at Monte-Carlo Masters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top seed Alexander Zverev crashed out in his opening match of the Monte-Carlo Masters with Italy's Matteo Berrettini as defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and Britain's Jack Draper both advanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Zverev has struggled for any kind of form since his defeat by Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final at the end of January, winning just six of 12 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with a first-round bye in the absence of world number one Sinner, who is suspended for a doping violation until May 4, Zverev was among the favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a controlled start to the game, the German slumped to a 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 defeat to 34th-ranked Berrettini, at the end of a high-flying match, which had included an impressive 48-stroke rally won by the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been the worst period since my injury [the] last few months," said Zverev who has suffered a string of early exits of late, including at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a great first set, and once I got broken in the second set I play ten levels down. My ball is much slower. I stopped hitting the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same story the last few months. Nothing changes. So it's me who lost the match, once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought my level was terrible, but that's just my opinion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion and three-time Monte Carlo winner Tsitsipas advanced past 38th-ranked Australian Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a lacklustre US tour, the Dubai winner won through 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in his second round tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Wells champion Draper, seeded fifth, eased past 45th-ranked American Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-1.
  <br>

  Novak Djokovic – the winner in 2013 and 2015 – and Carlos Alcaraz start their campaigns on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An 88th-minute Davide Frattesi goal took Inter Milan to a 2-1 win at Bayern Munich, giving the Italians the edge after the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Undermanned Bayern, nursing a bulging casualty ward, set the tone in the first half-hour on Tuesday, with Michael Olise and Harry Kane narrowly failing to break through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter opened the scoring on the 38-minute mark when Marcus Thuram's clever back-heel found Lautaro Martinez who blasted home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italians maintained control until Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller, days after announcing a summer departure after 25 years at the club, scored the equaliser with a typical poacher's finish with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not content to be spectators to a Bayern fairytale ending, Inter broke on the counter just three minutes later, with Carlos Augusto finding Frattesi, who scored Inter's second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter, defeated in the final by Manchester City two seasons ago, have their noses in front in their bid to make the last four of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter goalscorer Martinez toasted the "complete performance", telling Amazon Prime his side showed "character, personality", adding "the boys showed what they were made of".
  <br>
  <br>
  The late goal consigned Bayern to their first home defeat in the Champions League since 2021, a run of 22 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Champions League winner Mueller lamented Inter's "stupid" late goal, saying "when we watch the footage, when we analyse it, we'll know we could have done better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't a brutal defeat. We've played the first half, the first leg – we imagined a different result but we know there's still something in it for us." (AFP)

    Arsenal stun Real Madrid with Rice's free-kick magic

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal defied the odds with their stunning 3-0 win against Real Madrid as Declan Rice's free-kick magic left the Champions League holders in disarray.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rice inspired one of the greatest results in Arsenal's storied history with two blistering free-kicks in the second half of the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the third goal for Arteta's side as they moved within touching distance of a first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an incredible moment for England midfielder Rice, who had never scored a free-kick in his career – a period spanning 338 previous matches – before the first of his thunderbolts flashed past Real keeper Thibaut Courtois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had also failed to find the net from a direct set-piece in almost four years, with their last coming via Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunners captain Odegaard put his hands on his head in disbelief when Rice completed his set-piece double, while Arteta was equally surprised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Declan's been very determined because we have said in the last few months that we have not scored a direct free-kick in three-and-half years," the Arsenal manager said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and of that quality from the same player, a player that has never scored a free-kick before in his career, what are the odds?
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a player who can do it, how clean he strikes it it's Declan. But you have to execute it at the highest level. And against one of the best keepers in the world as well. It's amazing."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a cathartic result for Arsenal, who have endured a rocky season marred by their failure to keep pace with Liverpool in the Premier League title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are 11 points adrift of Liverpool, leaving the Champions League as their last chance this season to win a first trophy since the 2020 FA Cup.
  <br>

  Few would have expected them to get past 15-time European champions Real before the first leg.

  <br>
  But now Arsenal will travel to the Bernabeu for the return tie next week as firm favourites to progress to a last four clash against Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa. (AFP)

 Mainland and Hong Kong shares fell at the open on Wednesday as the US trade war escalated, following Washington's decision to impose 104 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, starting around noon, Hong Kong time.

  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index sank 3.14 percent, or 632 points, to 19,494, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.13 percent, or 35 points, to 3,110.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US media giant Comcast Corp will build its first Universal theme park and resort in Europe in Bedford, north of London, opening in 2031, the British government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The park will create 20,000 jobs during construction and a further 8,000 jobs across the hospitality and creative industries when it opens, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected to attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year, a number currently only exceeded in Europe by Disneyland Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios has five resorts and parks in the US states of California and Florida as well as in Singapore, Japan and China, offering rides and attractions based on Jurassic Park, Harry Potter and other movie franchises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has sought to ease planning demands to boost investment in Britain, said in a statement the multi-billion pound investment would make Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plans for the site include a theme park, featuring several themed lands, a 500-room hotel and a retail, dining and entertainment complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh showed Starmer the plan in London on Tuesday, saying he "could not be more excited" to create a Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast bought a 500-acre former brickworks in Bedfordshire, about 55 miles north of London, in 2023. It already owns Sky, which is Europe's biggest pay-TV business.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had been in talks with the British government since last year about turning the site into a theme park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park and resort are subject to planning permission, the government said. (Reuters)

    Trump's sweeping global tariffs take effect

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal over tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799523_1_20250409074554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

    Trump signs order to 'turbocharge' coal mining in US

<img alt="President Trump speaks next to coal industry workers, on the day he signs energy-related executive orders at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799521_1_20250409073316.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed executive orders to "turbocharge coal mining" in the country, seeking to "more than double" electricity production to keep up with power-hungry artificial intelligence technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The executive orders, which Trump signed surrounded by miners in hard hats, will lift regulatory barriers to coal extraction and suspend the planned closures of numerous coal-fired power plants across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will end the government bias against coal," said the Republican, who instructed the Department of Justice to identify and fight any state or local regulations that were "putting our coal miners out of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that it would be "possible to extract enormous amounts of critical minerals and rare earths, which, you know, we need for technology and high technology in the process of coal mining."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lena Moffitt, director of the climate NGO Evergreen, criticised the president in a statement for using artificial intelligence as "a cover to bail out his fossil fuel donors with the dirtiest, most expensive power source on the grid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Production of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, has fallen sharply in the United States over the last 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, coal accounted for just over 16 percent of total electricity production, outstripped by renewable energies at just over 21 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long been a sceptic of climate change, and since his return to the White House has set about boosting fossil fuels through deregulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, his administration announced a wave of environmental rollbacks targeting the green policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the most significant of them was revisiting a 2024 rule that requires coal-fired plants to eliminate nearly all their carbon emissions or commit to shutting down altogether, a cornerstone of Biden's climate agenda. (AFP)

<img alt="Rescuers work at the site of the collapsed Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799520_1_20250409073023.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers raced to find survivors on Tuesday among the rubble of a Dominican Republic nightclub where at least 98 people, including a Major League Baseball star, were killed when the roof collapsed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Renowned Dominican merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was on stage at the popular Jet Set nightclub when the roof caved in shortly after midnight, was one of those caught up in the calamity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers said the 69-year-old was among dozens of people trapped in the rubble, some of whom were heard crying for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Dominican media outlets later reported that Perez had been found dead but Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Centre, said forensics experts had "not confirmed that they found the body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 370 rescue personnel combed mounds of fallen bricks, steel bars and tin sheets for survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was 51-year-old retired MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who won a World Series in 2011 with the St Louis Cardinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued alive but died of his injuries while being taken to hospital, local media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when disaster struck shortly at 12:44 am local time. The club has capacity for 700 people seated and about 1,000 people standing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of ambulances ferried the injured to hospital, as scores of people gathered outside the venue desperately seeking news of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll started at 15 and kept rising throughout the day. By evening it had reached 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Abinader visited the scene and declared three days of national mourning. (AFP)

<img alt="US stocks have been in free fall since Trump's " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799508_1_20250409051017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled again on Tuesday as initially successful efforts to rebound from big losses faded amid worries over US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent to 4,982, its first close below 5,000 points in nearly a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended down 0.8 percent at 37,645, a swing of about 1,780 points below its session peak, while the Nasdaq shed 2.2 percent to 15,267.
  <br>
  <br>
  After three days of losses, Wall Street stocks opened buoyantly as traders embraced talk of White House negotiations with Japan and South Korea in the hopes Trump's trade onslaught might be short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investors grew edgy as the day progressed with no concrete progress. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed plans for massive tariffs on China to go into effect overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously investors are clamouring for clarity and there still isn't any," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, who estimated that the market now sees a greater than 50 percent chance of a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's "Liberation Day" event announcing tariffs on major US trading partners last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials have signalled openness to dealmaking while blasting China for enacting sharp retaliatory tariffs in response to the new US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump plans to impose another 50 percent duty on Chinese goods at midnight, bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished the day in the red, while most of the Dow was also in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Especially big losers in the blue-chip index included Apple, down five percent and Nike, down 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But UnitedHealth Group surged 5.4 percent after the Trump administration finalised a rule boosting payments to insurers under the government Medicare programme. (AFP)

    Grand National winning jockey Mullins suspended

<img alt="Disciplinary officials found Patrick Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799506_1_20250409031635.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Mullins has been given an eight-day suspension after he was found to have breached whip rules when riding Nick Rockett to Grand National glory on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish amateur rider steered the eight-year-old to victory in the celebrated steeplechase at the Aintree course in Liverpool to complete a notable family double, given 33-1 shot Nick Rockett is trained by his father, Willie Mullins.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the race, Willie Mullins, who achieved the impressive feat of saddling the first three home in the world's most famous jumps race, in addition to being the father of the winning rider, said: "This is the best day ever, this will never be topped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary officials, however, found Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Grand National is deemed to be a Class One race under British rules, the usual penalty of four days for such an offence was doubled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Mullins was, therefore, suspended for eight days in April and May.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result of the Grand National remained unaltered, however, as is often the case with whip offences in British horseracing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a situation critics believe encourages jockeys to break the rules, particularly in showpiece races such as the Grand National, rather than face the possible anger of owners, trainers and punters who might otherwise claim their horse has not been 'ridden out' fully in a finish. (AFP)

 The Denver Nuggets, mired in a four-game losing streak as the NBA playoffs approach, fired coach Michael Malone on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Malone led the Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023, but despite the exploits of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets have struggled for consistency this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are fourth in a tight Western Conference race with four teams just a half-game behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Denver Nuggets have relieved head coach Michael Malone of his duties and will not extend general manager Calvin Booth," the Nuggets said in a statement, adding that assistant coach David Adelman will assume head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets have three games remaining in the regular season, which concludes on Sunday. (AFP)

    UN chief says Gaza transformed into 'killing field'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become "a killing field," blaming Israel for blocking aid and failing in its "unequivocal obligations" to meet the needs of the Palestinian territory's residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  "More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened," Guterres said in remarks to journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the Geneva Conventions governing the treatment of people in war, he emphasised the obligation of the "occupying power" to ensure the provision of food and medical supplies to the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of that is happening today. No humanitarian supplies can enter Gaza," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli authorities newly proposed 'authorisation mechanisms' for aid delivery risk further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour," Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referencing recent Israeli proposals over controlling aid into Gaza, which a UN source said included monitoring calories to prevent misuse by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let me be clear – we will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality," he said, demanding guarantees for the unhindered entry of aid to the coastal territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guterres also raised the alarm about the situation in the West Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The current path is a dead end – totally intolerable in the eyes of international law and history," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes it even worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is time to end the dehumanisation, protect civilians, release the hostages, ensure lifesaving aid, and renew the ceasefire." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk on Tuesday described Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, as "truly a moron" in a growing rift over Donald Trump's tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a key aide to the president, has signalled his opposition to the tariffs, and the Tesla CEO hit out after Navarro described his electric vehicle company as "not a car manufacturer" but "a car assembler."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's new tariffs on imports have roiled markets as fears of a global recession rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted his criticism on X under a clip of Navarro saying Tesla imported batteries, electronics and tyres, and that Musk "wants the cheap foreign parts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk fired back, saying that "Tesla has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's richest man recently backed a free-trade zone between North America and Europe – a wish at odds with Trump's flagship tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has ruled out any pause in his aggressive stance despite retaliatory action from China and signs of criticism from within his Republican Party. (AFP)

    Referees to wear body cameras at Club World Cup

<img alt="During this year's competition refs will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799493_1_20250408234007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Referees at this year's Club World Cup will be equipped with body cameras and instructed to implement new rules to cut down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, Fifa announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by Ifab, the sport's lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the offence is rarely penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers were on Tuesday racing to find survivers among the rubble of a Dominican Republic night club where at least 18 people died and dozens were hurt in an early-morning roof collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 400 rescue personnel were at the Jet Set nightclub in the Caribbean nation's capital Santo Domingo, authorities said, with dozens of ambulances on standby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media said there were between 500 and 1,000 people in the club when the roof came down following a sudden blackout during a performance by renowned merengue singer Rubby Perez, who was also trapped in the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, who died of her injuries in hospital, according to President Luis Abinader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have 18 dead; we continue working with the various institutions that are part of the national emergency center," Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center (COE), told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendez said rescuers could hear people in the rubble crying out for help.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there have been 121 trips to hospital with between "two and three" injured people per ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as there is hope for life, all authorities will be working to recover or rescue these people," Mendez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez's daughter Zulinka said the singer, 69, was still at the scene of the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if they have him in an ambulance because they're not letting me through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media published images of a construction crane at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are rescuing all the people we can save alive and recovering those bodies we find along the way. But we have focused on people we can rescue alive because we hear them asking for help," Mendez said of the ongoing operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abinader said on X the government has "been following the case minute by minute since it happened," before rushing to the scene himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main objective is to save lives... We are deeply affected," he said on his arrival. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There was fanfare at the Kai Tak Stadium on Tuesday evening as Coldplay kicked off the first of four concerts in Hong Kong on its current world tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show marked the British pop band’s return to the SAR after a 16-year hiatus, and the first concert held at the new stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoe, a longtime Coldplay fan, said she's attending the band’s concert for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because it might be the last concert they had in their career, so we're expecting just a very good concert tonight,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan, Judy, got the standing ticket that puts her right next to the stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope there will be fireworks tonight,” she said. “We already know the routine playlist, but I still want to hear if somebody's gonna order a song. My favourite song is ‘Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.’”
  <br>
  <br>
  She was upset about missing Coldplay’s previous world tour and said this time is a dream come true.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Actually, I used to study in London, but I think it's 2018, 2019, that’s the time they stopped the world tour. So it's such a shame that I didn't get a chance to see the tour. This time is like my dream comes true,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers allowed people to bring empty reusable plastic or silicone bottles that can hold up to 600 millilitres of liquid into the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were restrictions to bag size while a list of items, including professional cameras and handheld signs, are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most fans whom RTHK spoke to, including Bertha, found the rules reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm aware of this and I think it's quite normal to have such restrictions. Because when I was in Taiwan and New Zealand, they didn't allow people to bring water bottles inside as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the concert got underway, the atmosphere was electric.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started with the band's vocalist, Chris Martin, greeting fans in Cantonese.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Coldplay were delighted to be in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans reached another frenzy when local singer Marf, from the girl group Collar, was invited as a guest to perform with the band.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band also handed out LED wristbands that lit up in different colours for each song.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police, meanwhile, said five people were arrested on suspicion of reselling tickets at inflated prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coldplay will put on three more sold-out shows at Kai Tak Stadium on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

    Tram fares to go up on May 12

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tram fares will go up by up to 15 percent starting from May 12.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise comes after the Executive Council approved an application from Hong Kong Tramways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the new fare will be HK$3.30, or 10 percent more, for those aged 12 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rise will be steeper for the elderly, as their new fare of HK$1.50 is an increase of 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children aged between three and eleven will pay HK$1.60, or a rise of nearly 7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The price for monthly tickets will stay the same at HK$260.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said a number of factors were considered as part of the vetting process, such as rising operating costs, the quality and quantity of service provided and public acceptability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government considered the fare increase necessary for maintaining stable operation, and that [its] proposed level of increase is acceptable," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the fare increase, the tramway remains the most economical means of transportation serving the northern shore of Hong Kong Island."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they'll continue to work with the company and encourage it to find different sources of revenue, especially tying in with its concept of "tourism everywhere" and preserving its historical value.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last fare increase for trams was in July 2022, when different classes of charges also rose by up to around 15 percent.

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan, centre back row, says more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799460_1_20250408181322.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, OASES, will seek to attract cultural enterprises in the future in a way that combines innovation and technology with artistry.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comments at a signing ceremony between the office and 16 companies, including Ant Digital Technologies and China Mobile Innovation Research Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the creative and cultural industries hold huge power and their development is unstoppable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This sector, enriching lives, sparking joy and preaching cultures, is among the fastest growing in the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How artistic toys and animation have captivated audiences globally is simply amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through Hong Kong's platform, creative pioneers can indeed extend their reach across continents.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said more than 80 strategic enterprises have set up in Hong Kong in the past two years, and will bring nearly HK$50 billion worth of investment and create more than 20,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car company Li Auto is among the companies securing a partnership agreement with OASES.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its senior vice president, Li Guanhua, said the company is looking to invest around HK$20 billion in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We chose to come to Hong Kong to develop a core research centre this year because we value Hong Kong’s position in the whole economic, financial and fintech aspect,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investment in Hong Kong will be long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the Hong Kong office will serve as an offshore clearing centre, as well as a research centre for AI facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether US tariffs would affect company sales, Li said the firm only started developing its overseas market this year but the United States would not be its target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another company, Enlight Medical, said Hong Kong provides a stable environment given the current chaos created by US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong government said it will not follow Beijing’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US,” said co-founder Rocky Bian of the health technology company.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This helps us stabilise our global supply chain.

  “Hong Kong is a free port. Apart from re-export trades, the city also provides stability in importing machine components and raw materials from the US.”

  Bian said the company will hire around 900 workers in a few years time, spanning from researchers to quality assurance talent.

  The cost of operating in Hong Kong, he added, does not differ by much from mainland cities.

  “Hong Kong is a hub of the financial supply chain and market, and the government is also promoting and encouraging business development in this area,” said its chief security officer Li Kang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they are also under pressure due to risks in the new area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are here to try to safeguard institutions against risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can help make sure users make the right investments and secure their assets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the company has already been serving one of the largest banks in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to "fight to the end" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain "the smooth operation of the capital market".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt rose more than one percent, having dropped more than four percent on Monday. (AFP/Xinhua)

    China 'ready to fight till the end' over US tariffs

 China is ready to fight till the end if the United States is bent on waging a tariff war or trade war, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the US threat of an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese imports, spokesman Lin Jian said the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and the rules of the World Trade Organization, seriously damages the rule-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impacts the stability of the global economic order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is typical unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying, and has been widely opposed by the international community," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that pressuring, threatening and blackmailing are not the right ways to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its lawful rights and interests," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States ignores the interests of the two countries and the international community and insists on fighting tariff wars and trade wars, China will surely fight till the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Premier Li Qiang said China's macroeconomic policies this year have fully taken into account various uncertainties and it has sufficient policy tools in reserve, adding that Beijing was "fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Li made the comments in a phone call with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who urged Beijing to ensure a negotiated solution to problems caused by the sweeping US import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier added that China's countermeasures are aimed not only at safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interest, but also at defending global trade rules and international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China will continue its opening-up policies and step up cooperation with other countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against Trump's tariffs on Friday with extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods, adding to the 10 to 15 percent tariffs it had imposed on US agricultural goods in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combined rate threatens to all but end the agricultural trade between the two countries. (Reuters)

    Singapore PM says tariffs 'not act of a friend'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Singapore are "not actions one does to a friend", the city-state's leader said on Tuesday, adding the government will likely downgrade this year's economic growth forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Lawrence Wong warned that the "likelihood of a full-blown global trade war is growing" and urged his trade-reliant nation to prepare for difficult times ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed by the US move, especially considering the deep and long-standing friendship between our two countries," he said in an address to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are not actions one does to a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore was hit with a 10 percent tariff despite a free-trade agreement with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate is much less than those imposed on other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said the trade-dependent nation will be particularly hurt by a slump in the world economy and the unravelling of the global trading system based on free trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Singapore may or may not go into recession this year, but I have no doubt that our growth will be significantly impacted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade ministry is reassessing its economic growth forecast this year of 1 to 3 percent "and will likely revise it downwards," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said that under the US-Singapore FTA, the city-state imposes zero tariffs on American goods. Singapore also runs a trade deficit with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the tariffs were truly reciprocal and if they were meant to target only those with trade surpluses, then the tariff for Singapore should be zero," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore hosts thousands of US companies and many of them have made the city their Asia-Pacific headquarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the island-nation is not a US defence treaty ally, it enjoys robust military ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This marks a profound turning point," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are entering a new phase in global affairs, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as "ignorant and impolite", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from "Chinese peasants".
 <br>
  <br>
  "China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a "globalist economy" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture," the vice president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the United States, rather than making goods abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most economists question that and say his tariffs are arbitrary. (AFP)

    Any Trump bid to weaken greenback 'set to fail'

<img alt="Donald Trump will find it extremely hard to get China and Europe to consent to a devaluation for the greenback after antagonising them with his tariffs' move. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799408_1_20250408135600.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport worker convicted of rioting and wounding with intent in Yuen Long in 2019 was jailed for seven years on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 60, was found guilty last week after a retrial for taking part in the violence nearly six years ago on July 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's lawyer argued in mitigation last week that his client had a rather small part in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But District Court judge Eddie Yip dismissed the plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the case was very serious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, he said, was among a group of white-shirted men that carried out what he described as an indiscriminate attack on others inside and near Yuen Long MTR station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing starting point for two co-defendants in the case was seven years behind bars, Yip noted, and the same was applied to Wong with no discount offered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong had been acquitted in 2021, and a higher court ordered a retrial after the Department of Justice won an appeal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 YouTube streamer IShowSpeed's flash visit to the city last week shows that Hong Kong is safe, fun and open, according to Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some netizens and lawmakers have questioned the rough planning of the itinerary, saying the government missed a great opportunity to promote Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers, Law said Speed's nine-and-a-half-hour citywide livestream served as an excellent promotion of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she believes spontaneity is the streamer's selling point and that he might not have wanted to follow an official itinerary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowds that gathered during his MTR ride caused some disruption, which was unexpected even for Speed himself, Law added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted there have been changes in the ways tourism is promoted, adding that online influencers have become an important way for people to uncover new places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is a very open place. Anyone can have a great time as long as they follow the rules," she said, adding that it sent a great message in the current geopolitical climate.

    Beijing prepared for US tariff retaliation: Regina Ip

<img alt="Regina Ip said the SAR government should come up with policies in case of a global recession. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799392_1_20250408122043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government is well prepared and has a broad arsenal to respond to any further tariff escalation by US President Donald Trump, according to Executive Council convenor Regina Ip.
 <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Tuesday on Washington's recent tariff barrage launched across the world, including an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing hit back with tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States and added 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, said Trump is effectively ceding the role of champion of free trade and rule-based multilateral system to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China will be the winner, in terms of trade, technology and moral high ground," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip stressed that if Trump does decide to retaliate further, it will only continue to plummet global markets, and that the tariff war will likely continue unless Trump's tycoon backers reign him in or Republicans get burned in the midterm elections next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the likelihood of a global recession, Ip said it's likely.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government should work out a panoply of policy options to buoy the local economy pending a global recession," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the SAR not setting any countermeasures to the US tariffs, Ip said Hong Kong will continue to be a free port, noting that the city is bound by the Basic Law, as well as its tariff commitments to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weighing in on the same issue, Andrew Leung, China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, said the US was upending the very trade institutes it helped create after World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the current Trump policies are a continuation of what he had started during his previous term in office, and therefore "China had been preparing for this for a long, long time."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Immediately, after Trump 1.0 President Xi was quite prescient -- shortly after Trump won the White House for the first time, he already ordered China to go full steam ahead towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance -- particularly on high technology," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said Chinese products will remain competitive globally, like BYD electric cars, because of the superior technology and price, despite the tariff headwinds.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday Hong Kong will seize every opportunity to help social media influencers show the city to the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee was speaking after YouTube megastar IShowSpeed's visit here last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live streamer drew crowds of fans and chaos as he made his way to Causeway Bay, Ocean Park and the Temple Street night market on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Tourism Board had reached out to the YouTuber but didn't hear back from him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This KOL [key opinion leader] has many followers, he has many fans, so I'm sure we all take very seriously any opportunity to publicise Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also called on different sectors of the community to welcome and support influencers coming to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see there were hotels, restaurants, public transport operators which provided Speed and other KOLs assistance in their broadcasting," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So if anyone wants to promote Hong Kong, please do our best to help them because Hong Kong is our home."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about his assessment of Super March, Lee said the series of mega events attracted overseas tourists and boosted the hotel and catering industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said more mega events are lined up for April, including the first-ever World Internet Conference Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Hong Kong.

    HK economist expects Fed to cut rates sooner

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799386_1_20250408113645.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist said on Tuesday he expects the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected in a bid to rescue the American economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The prediction came a day after a global stock market rout amid concern over the ongoing trade war as seen in tit-for-tat tariff levies between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said that if the US stocks continue to slump, the Fed's top priority is to save the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the chance of the Fed cutting rates due to the slump in US stocks and global stock market is high," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because if US stocks continue to drop, it has to save the economy first.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Inflation is not its top concern."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent tariffs on Chinese goods from Wednesday if Beijing does not retract its 34 percent counter-tariffs to the American levies imposed last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said this shows that Trump was scared of China tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist pointed out that as soybean is one of China's top US imports, soybean farmers would be hit the hardest under the potential additional levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said if the trade war escalates, it might give rise to smuggling and panic buying in the United States when some goods are not imported to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chong expects Hong Kong stocks to remain volatile in the short run and suggests investors not enter the market for now.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Florida and Walter Clayton somehow overcame Houston’s tough defence on Monday night to carve out a 65-63 victory in an NCAA title-game thriller which was not decided until Clayton’s own D stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was getting Houston’s Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning three points in the final seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for travelling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, and they won their third overall title and first since 2007, this time led by third-year coach Todd Golden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cougars and coach Kelvin Sampson were denied their first championship. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said it would enhance services on the Tuen Ma and East Rail lines this week to accommodate concertgoers attending Coldplay’s performances at Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will hold four concerts - Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday - with shows expected to conclude after 10pm each evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rail operator warned that stations along the Tuen Ma Line, particularly Kai Tak and Sung Wong Toi, may experience heightened crowds, with concert entry times overlapping with the evening rush hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said temporary measures such as one-way directional systems and adjusted entry and exit routes would be implemented at these stations to manage passenger flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers are advised to pay attention to station announcements and follow directional signage for guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR also reminded cross-border passengers to check the last train departure times for Lo Wu Station to ensure timely connections after the events.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said additional staff would be deployed to assist with crowd control, and the corporation emphasised ongoing coordination with relevant authorities to streamline operations.

    Kennedy gets teeth into ending US fluoridation

<img alt="Robert F Kennedy says a task force of health experts will study the issue of fluoride in water and make new recommendations. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799385_1_20250408113219.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Monday he’s assembling a task force of health experts to study the issue and make new recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA sets the maximum level allowed in public water systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy was speaking after a news conference with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can direct the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican governor Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents say the law will hurt residents who can’t afford regular dentist visits and may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much – as long as it doesn’t exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently four milligrams per liter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 they set guidelines for how much should be added to water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn. (AP)

 Global temperatures hovered at historic highs in March, Europe's climate monitor said on Tuesday, prolonging an extraordinary heat streak that has tested scientific expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, it was the hottest March ever recorded by a significant margin, said the Copernicus Climate Change Service, driving rainfall extremes across a continent warming faster than any other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world, meanwhile, saw the second-hottest March in the Copernicus dataset, sustaining a near-unbroken spell of record or near-record-breaking temperatures that has persisted since July 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, virtually every month has been at least 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was before the industrial revolution when humanity began burning massive amounts of coal, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  March was 1.6C above pre-industrial times, prolonging an anomaly so extreme that scientists are still trying to fully explain it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That we're still at 1.6C above pre-industrial is indeed remarkable," said Friederike Otto of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of global warming increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is not just about rising temperatures but the knock-on effect of all that extra heat being trapped in the atmosphere and seas by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warmer seas mean higher evaporation and greater moisture in the atmosphere, causing heavier deluges and feeding energy into cyclones, but also affecting global rainfall patterns.
  <br>
  <br>
  March in Europe was 0.26C above the previous hottest record for the month set in 2014, Copernicus said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also "a month with contrasting rainfall extremes" across the continent, said Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which runs the Copernicus climate monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some parts of Europe experienced their "driest March on record and others their wettest" for about half a century, Burgess said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in March, scientists said that climate change intensified an extreme heatwave across Central Asia and fuelled conditions for extreme rainfall which killed 16 people in Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacular surge in global heat pushed 2023 and then 2024 to become the hottest years on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year was also the first full calendar year to exceed 1.5C: the safer warming limit agreed by most nations under the Paris climate accord.
  <br>
  <br>
  This represented a temporary, not permanent breach, of this longer-term target, but scientists have warned that the goal of keeping temperatures below that threshold is slipping further out of reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists had expected that the extraordinary heat spell would subside after a warming El Nino event peaked in early 2024, and conditions gradually shifted to a cooling La Nina phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high, sparking debate among scientists about what other factors could be driving warming to the top end of expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years. (AFP)

    'Reckless' tariffs hurt global trade, says John Lee

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hit out at the United States for slapping "reckless" tariffs on countries and places around the world, vowing to take steps to respond to the sweeping levies through deepening international cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has announced an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which also applies to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming on top of existing levies, the tariffs go up to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer adheres to free trade, arbitrarily undermining the internationally established rules of world trade," Lee said ahead of Tuesday's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its ruthless behaviour damages global and multilateral trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reckless imposition of tariffs affects many countries and regions around the world with huge tax rate increases and covering a wide range of goods, disrupting the world's economic and trade order, bringing great risks and uncertainties to the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Export enterprises will inevitably be affected in the short run by the tariffs, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To address the effects brought about by US tariffs, the chief executive said seizing opportunities on the mainland and integrating into national development is one of seven key areas in which the SAR government is hoping to strengthen its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also pledged to boost international exchanges, strengthen global financial cooperation, and work to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong, he said the authorities would accelerate industrial transformation, intensify efforts in the development of innovation and technology, while supporting enterprises to cope with the impacts of tariffs and external challenges.

    Seoul confirms June 3 date for presidential elections

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea will hold a presidential election on June 3, the country's acting president said on Tuesday, after Seoul's former leader Yoon Suk-yeol was removed from office over a disastrous declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has been effectively leaderless since December, when former president Yoon attempted to subvert civilian rule but was quickly impeached by lawmakers and suspended from office.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court last week upheld his impeachment, stripping him of the top job, and triggering fresh elections, which must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had held "discussions with the National Election Commission and other related agencies", Acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also took into account "the need to ensure smooth election operations and allow sufficient time for political parties to prepare," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result they have decided "to set June 3 as the date for South Korea's 21st presidential election," he said, adding that the day would be designated as a temporary public holiday to facilitate voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han called upon ministries and the National Election Commission to "make thorough preparations to ensure an election that is fairer and more transparent than ever, and one that can earn the trust of the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike a regular poll, where a president-elect has a two-month transition period, the winner of the June 3 election will be inaugurated the following day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han resumed acting as president recently after the Constitutional Court threw out his own impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Presidential elections are typically held on Wednesdays, but no specific weekday is required for snap polls triggered by a vacancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official campaign period will run from May 12 until June 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner in any polls, with a 34 percent support rating according to the latest Gallup poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  His party already controls the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election but staged a political comeback as leader of the main opposition, despite a career shadowed by legal troubles, including ongoing trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In distant second place is Labour Minister Kim Moon-soo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polling around nine percent, he leads a pack of challengers from Yoon's People Power Party, which also includes former party chief Han Dong-hoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection over the martial law bid. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has ended emergency food aid for 14 countries, endangering the lives of millions of hungry or starving people, a United Nations agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Food Program (WFP), which was already grappling with a 40 percent drop in funding for this year, said  on Monday it had been advised of the new American aid halt to 14 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comments on X, the agency did not name these countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WFP is not the only UN body hit by US funding cuts, as the United States under President Donald Trump turns sharply inward and stops trying to help other countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration told the UN Population Fund, an agency dedicated to promoting sexual and reproductive health, that it was ending two programs, the organisation told AFP on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of programs was for Afghanistan, while the other involved Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries besides the United States have also announced funding cuts in recent months, causing alarm among NGOs and international organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has largely gutted USAID, the main US humanitarian assistance organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  It previously had a yearly budget of US$42.8 billion, which was 42 percent of all aid money disbursed around the world. (AFP)

    Tokyo's Nikkei up 5.8pc as US tariffs fuel volatility

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

<img alt="JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799345_1_20250408084713.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Monday that US President Donald Trump's tariffs will likely lift inflation, describing himself as "very cautious" in light of the rising recession risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon, an influential figure in markets as the longest serving CEO of a major Wall Street firm, said the US economy had been steady "for years" but was "already weakening" even before Trump's watershed tariff announcement last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on investments and capital flows, the effect on corporate profits and the possible effect on the US dollar," Dimon wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back," said Dimon, adding "my most serious concern is how this will affect America's long-term economic alliances."
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan analysts published a note on Friday expecting US GDP to contract this year "under the weight of the tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also recently raised their risk of global recession to 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that if most of Trump's April 9 tariffs take effect, these charges - alongside likely sectoral duties - could tip their forecast to a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and global equities have been in free fall since Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week in a move the president touted as "Liberation Day" from international trade rules he argues have harmed the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation, along with continued high fiscal deficits, "the remilitarization of the world" and major investments supporting infrastructure and the green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While inflation has come down, most of what I see in the future is inflationary," said Dimon, who backs the need for reducing the US deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These large deficits are not sustainable - I do not know whether it will cause a real problem in six months or six years - the sooner we deal with it, the better," Dimon said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A volcano in the central Philippines erupted early on Tuesday morning, sending a plume of ash 4,000 metres into the sky and prompting calls for local school cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kanlaon Volcano, one of 24 active volcanoes in the Southeast Asian nation, erupted in December, prompting the evacuation of surrounding villages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area around the volcano on the island of Negros was still under evacuation orders when Tuesday's eruption occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An explosive eruption is currently occurring at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano that began at 5:51 am today," the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano "is producing a voluminous bent plume approximately 4,000 metres tall that is drifting southwest", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted on social media showed a wide, billowing plume of smoke slowly stretching into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The level three alert - out of a scale of five - put in place during December's eruption remained unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after the volcano spurted thousands of tonnes of harmful gases in a single day. (AFP)

<img alt="Daniil Medvedev advanced to the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799341_1_20250408081254.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Daniil Medvedev navigated his way into the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Monday, eventually seeing off former world number eight Karen Khachanov 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open winner Medvedev fought through in just shy of three hours on Court Rainier III against Khachanov, after having been a set and a break up on his fellow Russian.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an early exit from the Miami Open last month caused the 29-year-old to exit the top 10, Medvedev got back to winning ways on clay as he chases his first title since claiming the Rome Open two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, 11th seed Ben Shelton was stunned by 42nd-ranked Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and there will be no showdown between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka after the Swiss was defeated by Alejandro Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton went down 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-1 to his Spanish opponent, who reached the 2022 final at Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wild card Wawrinka also played out an epic that lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours before succumbing 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Chile's Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Gael Monfils beat Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and Matteo Berrettini set up a second-round meeting with top seed Alexander Zverev after winning in straight sets against Mariano Navone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Auger-Aliassime went down to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, but fellow top 20 player Lorenzo Musetti avoided a similar fate by coming back from a set down to defeat qualifier Bu Yunchaokete of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic beat American Sebastian Korda and Marcos Giron overcame fellow North American Denis Shapovalov, both in straight sets. (AFP)

<img alt="Newcastle defeated Leicester 3-0 at King Power Stadium. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799342_1_20250408082838.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle coasted to a 3-0 win over sorry Leicester on Monday to step up their Champions League charge and condemn the Foxes to an eighth straight Premier League defeat without scoring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, still on a high after winning the League Cup last month, are up to fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea but with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth place will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season after strong performances by English clubs in continental competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But relegation for Ruud van Nistelrooy's hapless team is all but certain after a solitary season in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 2-0 up in the 11th minute after two goals from Jacob Murphy, the second a tap-in from close range after an audacious effort from Fabian Schar hit the crossbar, and Harvey Barnes added a third before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester last scored a league goal in front of their own fans against Brighton on December 8 and they are the first side in football league history to lose eight home league games in a row without scoring a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle boss Howe said his "biggest challenge" had been maintaining focus after the club ended their 56-year trophy drought in the League Cup final against Liverpool last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't compliment them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a very down to earth, humble group who want to do well and represent the club in the right way. They have shown that in the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe said the race for the Champions League was "going to hot up".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next week for us is a big week. We have three really tough games (against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa) and that will go a long way in seeing where we are at the end of the season." (AFP)

    Trump announces direct nuclear talks with Iran

<img alt="US President Donald Trump made the announcement about the Iran talks during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799344_1_20250408083723.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said the United States was starting direct, high-level talks with Iran over its nuclear programme on Saturday, in an announcement during a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Tehran, but warned that the Islamic republic would be in "great danger" if the talks failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours later Tehran confirmed discussions were set for Saturday in Oman, but stressed they were "indirect" talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Iran and the United States will meet in Oman on Saturday for indirect high-level talks," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is as much an opportunity as it is a test," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in America's court."
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu meanwhile said the United States and Israel were working on another deal to free hostages from war-torn Gaza, where a ceasefire between Israel and Iran's ally Hamas has collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're dealing with the Iranians, we have a very big meeting on Saturday and we're dealing with them directly," Trump told reporters after a meeting that was meant to focus on Israel's bid to avoid US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not say where the talks would take place, but insisted they would not involve surrogates and would be at "almost the highest level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's stunning announcement came a day after Iran dismissed direct negotiations on a new deal to curb the country's nuclear programme, calling the idea pointless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president pulled out of the last deal in 2018, during his first presidency, and there has been widespread speculation that Israel, possibly with US help, might attack Iranian facilities if no new agreement is reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran's going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it, great danger, because they can't have a nuclear weapon," he said. (AFP)

    Supreme Court backs Trump over Alien Enemies Act

<img alt="US President Donald Trump has used the law to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799334_1_20250408075344.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based US Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of US immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorises removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alien Enemies Act authorises the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's "Terrorism Confinement Center."
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left US airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the US Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the US Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a "Radical Left Lunatic" and a "troublemaker and agitator."
  <br>
  <br>
  The DC Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that "Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here." Ensign responded, "We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said US officials had wrongly labelled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honour his favourite team, Real Madrid.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Monday following a volatile session amid rising recession worries due to US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow and S&P 500 ended lower despite flirting with positive territory, while the Nasdaq mustered a modest gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.9 percent at 37,965.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,062.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 15,603.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets again opened sharply lower following a gloomy round in Asian and European bourses on the weakening global growth outlook after Trump's sweeping tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the opening, major indices briefly surged into positive territory following a report that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials quickly denied the story, saying that in an interview on Fox News this official was misquoted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though Kevin Hassett was misquoted, market participants could see what would happen if there is a modicum of good news," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management, who is among market watchers who consider stocks oversold after the recent period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists see the tariffs as boosting the risk of recession in light of a possible resurgence in inflation and a slowdown in capital investment from businesses unsettled by shifting US policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with traders overwhelmingly projecting such a move at the central bank's June meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes updates on US consumer prices, as well as earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large US banks. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened huge additional tariffs on imports from China, raising the possibility of further escalation in a trade war that has already wiped trillions of dollars from global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If China does not withdraw its 34 percent increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50 percent, effective April 9th," Trump said in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not immediately clear how Trump's new threat factors into this calculation.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's response included export controls on rare earth elements, and Beijing plans for its own 34 percent tariff on US goods, stacking atop existing Chinese levies set to begin April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the new tariffs harmed the stability of global production and supply chains and seriously impacted the world’s economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Pressure and threats are not the way to deal with China. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Lin told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing's economic practices on social media Monday, criticising its "non-monetary tariffs" and "illegal subsidization of companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. (Agencies)

<img alt="All three major US indices were at more than one-year lows in early trading on Monday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799307_1_20250407222802.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Monday amid worries that a trade war induced by US President Donald Trump's tariffs will spark a global economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices were down more than 3 percent in early trading, reflecting continued angst after Trump's team over the weekend shrugged off the worldwide carnage in markets since his tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was down 3.8 percent in early trading, coming off its worst week since Covid; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,343 points, or 3.5 percent; and the Nasdaq composite was 4.2 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indices were at more than one-year lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump remained defiant on Monday. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, within the first hour of trading, stocks were swinging up, then down again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow briefly erased a loss of 1,700 points, shot up more than 800 points, then went back to a loss of 414 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 likewise made sudden up-and-down lurching movements and was down 1.3 percent in the first hour of trading. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A modern dance drama inspired by renowned Chinese poet Su Dongpo and innovative works relating to tea are some of the highlights of an upcoming Chinese Culture Festival organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held from June to September, the festival features more than 280 performing arts programmes, with art groups and artists from the SAR and around the country taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the highlights is the opening programme, "Dongpo: Life in Poems", a modern dance drama by the China Oriental Performing Arts Group and inspired by the life of Su, a poet in the 11th century in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  It features both modern dance and traditional crafts such as poetry writing and calligraphy "for a visually stunning and internationally accessible experience," said Ivy Ngai, a chief manager of the LCSD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai said another key event of the festival is the tea culture series, which features works curated by the Ambassador for Cultural Promotion, Tan Dun, blending traditional tea culture with music and performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, "there will be exhibitions, talks and workshops which try to immerse the audience into different kinds of activities and feel the significance and culture of tea," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think innovation is a very important element, that we would like to fuse in Hong Kong elements, and how we modernise the traditional essence," Ngai added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival also features Peking opera, plays and films, among other works.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to promote Chinese culture and enhance the public's national identity and cultural confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ngai also said she expects the event to be popular among visitors as well. "This year, we added on more bilingual elements so as to make the programmes more accessible to travellers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets to various performances are available from April 15.

    Southampton sack manager Ivan Juric after relegation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton have sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, the club announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were condemned to relegation in record time after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric's bottom-of-the-table side have lost 25 of their 31 top-flight games in a wretched campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation with seven fixtures left gives Southampton, last season's Championship play-off winners, an unwanted Premier League record, surpassing Derby and Huddersfield's relegations with six games left in 2008 and 2019 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric took over from Russell Martin in December, with Southampton already deep in trouble, but the 49-year-old won only one league match, at Ipswich in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints have lost seven of their past eight league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that we have today reached an agreement with our men's first-team manager, Ivan Juric, to end his spell at the club," said a Southampton statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, we haven't seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Rusk will take charge of the team as interim manager for the remainder of the season and will be assisted by Adam Lallana. (AFP)

<img alt="Paul Chan says investors should exercise caution going forward as market fluctuations are expected to continue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799293_1_20250407191203.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    World Expo hit with methane risk ahead of opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A level of methane high enough to potentially ignite a fire was detected at the World Expo site in Japan, organisers said on Monday, less than a week before the event opens.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas was detected at an underground pit for electrical equipment during a test opening of the venue, said the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers in the western city of Osaka barred people from coming near the affected area for about an hour to ventilate it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The site of Expo 2025, which opens on Sunday, was once a landfill. Discarded household waste creates large amounts of methane when it decomposes if left to rot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although organisers have previously taken steps to prevent the gas from being trapped, they vowed on Monday to increase the frequency of monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fence will be installed so that visitors will not come near the affected area, while ventilation will also be improved, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, a restroom at the venue under construction caught fire after a spark from welding work triggered an explosion due to methane trapped there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expo 2025 will run for six months, involving around 160 countries and regions for a display of their technological and cultural prowess. (AFP)

    Britain may close hundreds of quangos to cut costs

<img alt="Quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations, will be reviewed with a view to closing or merging them or bringing their functions back into government departments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain said it could close hundreds of arms-length government agencies, as it looks to reform the state to cut costs and improve productivity in what it called "a new era of global instability".
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain has hundreds of quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are taxpayer-funded but not controlled by ministers, and include public bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive, Network Rail and the Migration Advisory Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every quango across government will be reviewed, with a view to close, merge or bring functions back into [government] departments if its continued existence cannot be justified," the government said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is in belt-tightening mode as finance minister Rachel Reeves tries to meet her fiscal rules while also dealing with the fallout from US President Donald Trump's tariffs that have cut economic growth forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government warned that global instability meant it had to go "further and faster" in its reforms of the bureaucracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was scrapping NHS England, a body overseeing the health system, and bring its functions back into the government's health department, aiming to save hundreds of millions of pounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some quangos would remain unaffected by the reforms, such as those which scrutinise government or protect the rule of law, the government said. (Reuters)
