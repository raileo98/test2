<img alt="The trade ends a months-long falling out saga between the six-time NBA All-Star and the Miami Heat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790492_1_20250206110848.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The saga of star forward Jimmy Butler's falling out with the Miami Heat has reportedly ended with his trade to the Golden State Warriors ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic – citing unnamed team sources – reported that the Heat were finalising a deal to send Butler to the Warriors on a two-year, US$121 million extension through 2027 in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, Kyle Anderson and a first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler and the Heat had been at odds for months. The 35-year-old was still serving his third suspension by the team "due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, whose 17 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in 25 games this season is his lowest scoring average since the 2013 to 2014 season, had indicated in early January that he wanted to be traded, with the Heat apparently unwilling to provide the lucrative contract extension he sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler arrived in Miami from Philadelphia in 2019, leading them to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023. At Golden State, he will bolster the aging star duo of Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors are currently battling for a play-in berth in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the deal came together about an hour before the Warriors took on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City, where coach Steve Kerr suddenly closed the locker room to address his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors had reportedly expressed an interest in bringing Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant back to Golden State. Durant won NBA titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, but ESPN reported Wednesday night that he was not interested in a return to the Bay Area and it was unclear if any other move for him was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks traded All-Star forward Khris Middleton to the Washington Wizards for Kyle Kuzma, according to multiple reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal also sends forward Patrick Baldwin and a second-round 2025 NBA Draft pick while the Wizards also obtained guard A.J. Johnson and a first-round pick swap in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, 26-22, made the swap with the NBA-worst Wizards to land 29-year-old forward Kuzma, who has averaged 15.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton, 33, helped the Bucks win the NBA crown in 2021 and had been a mainstay of the team since coming over in a 2013 trade after spending his rookie campaign in Detroit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent off-season surgeries on both ankles and did not make his debut this season until December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wizards made another deal, according to ESPN, sending Lithuanian centre Jonas Valanciunas to the Sacramento Kings for two second-round draft picks and 20-year-old French guard Sidy Cissoko.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kings will unite newcomers Valanciunas and Zach LaVine and try to fight into a playoff spot. They rank eighth in the Western Conference at 25-24 – the same record as Phoenix and Golden State. (AFP)

<img alt="President Trump's executive order is his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790470_1_20250206091014.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From now on women's sports will be only for women," Trump said before he signed the order at the White House, surrounded by dozens of children and female athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With this executive order the war on women's sports is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson and firebrand Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene were among those in the audience to watch the signing ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls," Trump added to applause and cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order allows US government agencies to deny funds to schools that allow transgender athletes to compete on women's teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated... and risk your federal funding," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would now push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. (AFP)

    China launches dispute at WTO over Trump tariffs

<img alt="China says the US tariffs are discriminatory and violate its obligations to the WTO. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790466_1_20250206085516.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China filed a World Trade Organisation complaint on Wednesday against US President Donald Trump's new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and his cancellation of a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, arguing the actions are "protectionist" and break WTO rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's request for US trade consultations came as confusion reigned among shippers and retailers over Trump's cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption for package imports valued under US$800.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tax exemption has benefitted e-commerce firms including Shein, Temu and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Customs and Border Protection official said all small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong needed to have customs entries on file prior to arrival, and there was the potential for some cargo to be sent back without this paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent, Simon Marks, said this could lead to significant delays in package deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So recipients are going to be told in order for you to receive delivery of this package, before you get it, you have to pay the duty, and that will then release the package from Customs," he told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely going to delay substantially, at least to begin with, the delivery of these items here in the United States, because the customer service is going to have to look at every single one of them - and there are a vast number of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marks warned that apart from the supply chain disruption, consumers will also feel the pinch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Businesses] either have to absorb the tariffs, or they have to raise the price of the good that they are bringing in from outside the country and providing to American consumers," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's why so many economists here have argued that President Donald Trump and members of his economic inner circle simply don't understand the costs of tariffs to the American consumers, that they are inherently inflationary."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTO said China submitted a request for consultations with the US on the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request for consultations is the start of a dispute process that could lead to a ruling that Trump's duties violated trade rules in the same manner that a 2020 WTO ruling found that his first-term China tariffs broke trade regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such a victory would be unlikely to bring Beijing relief because the WTO's Appellate Body has been largely inoperable for years, as the US has blocked the appointment of appellate judges over what it views as judicial overreach by the body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body is unable to function with fewer than three judges. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Japan Airlines plane that was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta aircraft on Wednesday morning, airport authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities responded to the incident around 10:17am, the airport said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  All passengers from Japan Airlines flight 68 and Delta Air Lines flight 1921 were deplaned with no reported injuries, and response crews were working to move the aircraft off the ramp taxiway, the airport said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delta spokesperson Samantha Moore Facteau said in an email that its Boeing 737 was waiting to have ice removed from its exterior when the wing tip of another aircraft reportedly made contact with its tail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deicing, as it's known, can occur before a flight begins to taxi to the runway, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 142 passengers on board the flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and they were transferred to a new aircraft, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no reports of injuries for crew or passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Chan, one of the passengers on the Delta flight, said the plane “jiggled back and forth” and shook a little bit when the collision occurred.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, the captain announced that the plane's tail had been hit. Passengers remained calm, Chan said, and eventually got off the plane to be taken back to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport operations were minimally impacted because the incident occurred on a taxi lane, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, spokesperson Sam Lichtman said in an emailed statement. (AP)

    NFL to play 2026 regular season game in Melbourne

<img alt="The NFL has already played regular-season games in London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Toronto. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790462_1_20250206081850.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NFL has announced it will stage its first-ever regular season game in Australia in the 2026 season with the Melbourne Cricket Ground hosting the contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter O'Reilly, head of NFL International, said the designated team in that game would be the Los Angeles Rams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game at the 100,000-capacity MCG will be part of a "multi-year" arrangement as the league continues its global expansion. O'Reilly indicated that the game could be played in Week One to allow teams plenty of time to acclimatise after the long flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL has already played regular season games in London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Toronto.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL can now schedule up to eight league-operated international regular season games per season.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the NFL has confirmed games in London, Berlin and Madrid as part of the international games slate
  <br>
  <br>
  "Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the Victorian State Government, Visit Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and with the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NFL International has an office in Australia which has been working on the deal for almost three years and there had been intense efforts from the state government to secure Melbourne as the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're thrilled the NFL will be touching down in the sporting capital of Australia," said Premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan in the league statement. "Victoria is now the first-ever state in Australia to host a regular season NFL game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a win for jobs, a win for businesses and a win for fans who will get to see American football played at the iconic MCG," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 MotoGP world champion Jorge Martin has been ruled out of the remaining pre-season testing in Malaysia and will undergo surgery in Europe after crashing badly on the opening day at the Sepang track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard broke his hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia machine at turn two of the Sepang circuit. He had emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He now faces a race against time to be fit for the start of his title defence in the season-opening Thailand Grand Prix on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jorge Martin has been diagnosed with a right hand fracture and fractures in his left foot," MotoGP organisers said in a statement. "He has undergone a CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), both of which were negative for any injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will stay in hospital overnight and tomorrow he will fly back to Europe to undergo surgery on his right hand and left foot."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old, who made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati, had completed 13 laps when he lost control of his new bike and was flipped high into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard landed hard on his left foot before his head banged onto the asphalt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massimo Rivola, Principal of Aprilia Racing, said he had "no explanation" for the crash and that Martin had made "no mistake".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bad crash with apparently no reason from his side and from the bike," he said. "He is a world champion, but he is also a MotoGP rider. He's not an amateur. And the bike had no problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trackhouse team rider Raul Fernandez of Spain was also ruled out of the remaining two days with hand and foot fractures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Fabio Quartararo, meanwhile, topped the timesheets on the opening day of testing with a time of 1min 57.555sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was feeling quite good. We were focused on many things to try and make a good lap time and I think I did a good job," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Yamaha rider was fastest for most parts of Wednesday's session and claimed the fastest time on his 50th lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six-time Spanish MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez came in second fastest with a time of 1:57.606 on his new Ducati machine, while his brother Alex Marquez was third after clocking 1:57.738. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Wednesday appeared to walk back elements of President Donald Trump's shock plan to remove Palestinians from Gaza and launch a US takeover of the devastated territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Trump said "the US will take over" and "own" Gaza and that Palestinians would "go to other countries," the administration sought to downplay expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Republican leader wanted Palestinians to be only "temporarily relocated" out of Gaza instead of permanently resettled in Arab-majority states like Egypt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the rebuilding of Gaza would not be paid for by the United States and that US troops were not likely to be sent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been made very clear to the president that the United States needs to be involved in this rebuilding effort to ensure stability in the region for all people," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "that does not mean boots on the ground in Gaza, it does not mean American taxpayers will be funding this effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Trump has been "very clear" that "he expects our partners in the region, particularly Egypt and Jordan, to accept Palestinian refugees, temporarily, so that we can rebuild their home."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a demolition site right now. It's not a liveable place for any human being," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the deployment of US troops into Gaza was being ruled out, Leavitt said: "The president has not committed to that just yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is ready to "look at all options" when asked if he was working on options to deploy troops to Gaza, but did not provide specifics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options," Hegseth told journalists as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump's idea "was not meant as hostile. It was meant as, I think, a very generous move – the offer to rebuild and to be in charge of the rebuilding."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump wants to support "rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature, so that then people can move back in," Rubio told reporters on a visit to Guatemala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's surprise announcement on Tuesday sparked intense pushback from the Palestinian leadership and governments in the region and in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes in the context of mediated negotiations between Israel and the militant group Hamas to reach the "second phase" of a ceasefire deal that would bring a more permanent end to the devastating war in Gaza. (AFP)

    Newcastle sweep aside Arsenal, reach League Cup final

<img alt="Newcastle's Anthony Gordon at the end of the English League Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790457_1_20250206070552.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle swept into the League Cup final for the second time in three seasons with a vibrant 2-0 win against Arsenal in the semi-final second leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side took the lead through Jacob Murphy's first half strike at raucous St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon sealed Newcastle's 4-0 aggregate victory as Arsenal paid the price for some unusually slack defending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, who have beaten Arsenal three times this season, will face Liverpool or Tottenham in the final at Wembley on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham hold a 1-0 lead heading into Thursday's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having won the first leg 2-0 at Arsenal in January, Newcastle held their nerve to finish the job in front of their frenzied fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies are one step away from a first major trophy since winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe's team were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United in the 2023 League Cup final, while Newcastle have also lost the 1999, 1998 and 1974 FA Cup finals since their last silverware.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is 70 years since Newcastle lifted a major domestic trophy by winning the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finally winning a cup would be a huge moment for Newcastle, who have been transformed from serial underachievers to trophy contenders thanks to Howe's astute management and the financial backing of their Saudi owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, Newcastle have been forced to curtail their initial spending spree by profit and sustainability rules, but Howe has kept them upwardly mobile.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the high of thrashing Manchester City 5-1 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep their title challenge alive, Mikel Arteta's team came back down to earth with a bump on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has only won the 2020 FA Cup since taking charge at Arsenal in 2019 and this was another missed opportunity to end that drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United, the Gunners are through to the Champions League last 16 and sit six points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubbing salt into Arsenal's wounds, Newcastle fans sang "Mikel Arteta. It must the ball" in a cutting reference to the Spaniard's complaints that the different ball used in the League Cup had played a role in the first leg defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta admitted he was "disappointed" that Arsenal failed to sign a striker before the transfer window closed on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have lost Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka to long-term injuries and their lack of cutting edge was exposed in the face of Newcastle's well-drilled back five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard squandered a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead, blasting wildly against the post from close-range. It was a crucial miss as Newcastle punished Odegaard's profligacy in the 19th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak started the move by winning a header in front of William Saliba before breaking onto Gordon's pass into the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker slammed a fierce drive against the post, with the rebound falling perfectly for the Murphy to guide an agile finish into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murphy's fifth goal in all competitions this season sparked bedlam in the stands as Newcastle started to dream of Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka had to make a good save to repel Leandro Trossard's close-range effort moments later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak, a muscular combination of power and poise, was tormenting the usually rock-solid Arsenal defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to cope with Newcastle's relentless high press, Arsenal were disarray at the back and it was no surprise when Gordon delivered the knockout blow in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal keeper David Raya played a poor pass to Declan Rice on the edge of the area and Fabian Schar's crunching tackle sent the ball towards Gordon, who seized the chance with a clinical finish from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gordon celebrated by holding aloft a black and white scarf thrown onto the pitch as Newcastle's party started in earnest. (AFP)

    Nissan calls off Honda merger talks, Nikkei says

<img alt="Honda and Nissan said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790418_2_20250206060147.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nissan is set to call off merger talks with rival Honda, a source said on Wednesday, abandoning a US$60 billion-plus tie-up that would have created the world's number 3 automaker and raising questions about how it will drive a turnaround by itself.
 <br>
  <br>
  Talks have been complicated by growing differences between the two Japanese automakers, two people familiar with the matter, both of whom declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan shares slid more than 4 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which temporarily suspended trading in the stock after a Nikkei business daily report that it would pull out. Honda shares continued to trade and finished the day up more than 8 percent, in a sign of apparent investor relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development will raise fresh questions about how hard-hit Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan and aims to cut 9,000 employees and 20 percent of global capacity, can ride out its latest crisis without external help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota , and Nissan, its third-largest, said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales, bulking up in an industry facing a huge threat from China's BYD and other electric vehicle entrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported earlier that Nissan could call off talks after Honda had sounded it out about becoming a subsidiary. Nissan baulked because this was a departure from what was originally framed as a merger of equals, one source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan and Honda said in separate statements that the Nikkei report was not based on information announced by the companies and that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February and announce it at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, whose market value of about 7.92 trillion yen (US$51.90 billion) is more than five times bigger than Nissan at 1.44 trillion yen, was increasingly worried about its smaller rival's progress on the turnaround plan, said a second source.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie-up talks have coincided with disruption posed by potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Tariffs against Mexico would be more painful for Nissan than for Honda or Toyota, analysts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors may get concerned about Nissan's future (and) turnaround," said Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun, adding: "Nissan also has a larger risk exposure to US-Mexico tariffs than Honda and Toyota." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Wednesday, propelled by resurgent optimism about AI, and fading concern about the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.7 percent to 44,873, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to close at 6,061.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq edged up 0.2 percent to 19,692, held down by a 7.3 percent fall in the share price of Google's parent company Alphabet following disappointing quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was some good news for companies linked to the artificial intelligence revolution, after Alphabet's pledge to invest US$75 billion in capital expenditure related to AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has kind of separated out the weakness seen in Alphabet as sort of just an Alphabet issue," said Briefing.com's Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You take that big CapEx number and that's a little bit staggering, obviously," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they're going to spend 75 billion dollars in 2025, that should be pretty good for, you know, a company like Nvidia," he added, referring to the major chip designer whose shares closed up 5.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had "helped energise the AI trade a bit," he added. (AFP)

    Monkeys attack tourists at Angkor Wat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wild monkeys egged on by YouTubers have been rampaging at Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat complex, attacking tourists, wrecking temple stonework and damaging information boards, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency that runs the Unesco-listed site warned visitors to steer clear of the growing gangs of "aggressive" macaques that live around the sprawling complex of ruins and have been biting tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The macaques are native to the lush forests that surround Angkor Wat, but the Apsara National Authority said human interaction – particularly by people filming content to post online – had changed their behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small number of YouTubers regularly fed monkeys to create videos and this has "changed the monkeys' natural behaviour from being wild animals to domestic ones that are aggressive, steal food, and cause injuries among people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some have reportedly even filmed themselves abusing macaques.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long Kosal, a spokesman for the Apsara National Authority, said that as well as the danger posed to tourists, the agency was increasingly worried about the monkeys damaging the centuries-old stonework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples," he said, adding that the macaques had also damaged information boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency has urged tourists to leave the monkeys alone while visiting the ruins, and said it is looking for "an appropriate solution" to the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Angkor Wat, built from the 9th to the 15th centuries, was the capital of the Khmer Empire and is Cambodia's top tourist attraction, bringing in valuable revenue to a poor country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Popular sushi chain Sushiro on Wednesday expressed concern after a video showing a boy apparently putting a communal tong in his mouth at one of its restaurants was circulated online.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video showed the boy playing with a tong – used to pick up slices of ginger – with his hand and mouth, before dropping the utensil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All ginger slice containers and ginger slice tongs in the store have been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected," Sushiro said in a statement in response to the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sushiro Hong Kong severely condemns this behaviour and will seriously respond to this incident, including taking relevant legal actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chain also said it will reconsider the way it provides cutlery and plates, adding it will strictly implement quality control measures.

    USPS to resume parcel services from mainland China, HK

<img alt="USPS had temporarily suspended parcel services from mainland China and Hong Kong before the apparent U-turn. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790417_2_20250205212748.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Postal Service (USPS) has said it will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came less than a day after USPS said it would temporarily suspend the service, following US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports starting on Tuesday alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Effective February 5, 2025, the Postal Service will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts," USPS said in a statement put out late on Wednesday local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that its working to "implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery".
  <br>
  <br>
  The earlier suspension was denounced by Beijing, which called it "unreasonable suppression".
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing had also announced countermeasures to US tariffs on Tuesday, including tariffs of 10-15 percent on certain American imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government in a statement on Wednesday night strongly condemned the US measures, saying it might file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US' imposition of additional duty on products of Hong Kong ignores the basic fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a founding member of the WTO, the HKSAR has all along been upholding the principle of free and unimpeded trade. We strongly oppose any attempts to undermine Hong Kong's reputation and erode our status as a separate customs territory," the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-year-old girl who suffered a cardiac arrest during a suturing procedure at Yan Chai Hospital last May has died, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai Sum-yuet had been in intensive care in Princess Margaret Hospital since her heart stopped beating for 18 minutes while she was being given stitches for a head wound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two staff members were later charged with ill-treatment or neglect over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Kowloon West hospital cluster said the girl's condition deteriorated earlier this week and she died on Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman expressed deep sadness over the death, adding that the cluster will do what it can to help the girl's family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital cluster takes this incident very seriously and will fully cooperate with relevant judicial proceedings. The case has been referred to the coroner for follow-up," the spokesman said.

    China vows 'necessary measures' over parcel halt

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has urged the United States to stop "politicising trade and economic issues" and vowed to take unspecified "necessary measures" after the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced it had temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The USPS said the suspension will remain in place until further notice, with the move coming after US President Donald Trump slapped extra tariffs on Chinese imports and ended a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government calls on the United States to stop politicising and weaponising trade and economic issues, stop going after or suppressing Chinese companies," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said Beijing "deplores and firmly opposes" the move by Washington regarding Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, China announced countermeasures of tariffs on a number of US goods, which will take effect next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What [action] China takes is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners. Threatening China with pressure leads nowhere," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the United States to correct its wrongdoings, solve each side's concerns through equal-footed consultation, and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of China-US relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also called for dialogue between China and the US after Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said what is needed is not unilateral, additional tariffs but exchanges based on equality and mutual respect.

    People frustrated with postal suspension from HK to US

<img alt="Some at the General Post Office in Central said they were baffled by the sudden changes. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790377_1_20250205163532.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 People in Hong Kong who wish to send mail to the United States expressed their frustration at the situation on Wednesday, after the US stopped receiving parcels from mainland China and the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States Postal Service announced on Tuesday that it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hongkong Post's website showed postal services regarding packets and parcels to the US were temporarily not available. But people could still mail letters to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman at the General Post Office in Central said she was baffled by the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sending a gift to my son in college. They said I can't send a package, I can only send a letter. I'm not happy. I'm going to try SF Express and DHL," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she wanted to send a card and a congratulatory gift after her friend in the US had a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't sure why, what happened. They just said it's suspended for now. I'm going to find somewhere else and see if I can send it another way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK reached out to various international shipping companies, and DHL's customer service office said it was still accepting packages to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company said guidelines are updated every half an hour and things may change.
  <br>
  <br>
  FedEx and UPS, meanwhile, said postal services were not affected, but it may take a longer time for parcels to arrive in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrangement came after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and scrapped a duty-free exemption policy for low-value packages.

    Extra US tariffs on Chinese imports also cover HK

<img alt="The Hong Kong Shippers' Council said it was surprised that SAR goods are also subject to the latest US tariffs. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790374_1_20250205161715.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The additional 10 percent tariffs slapped on Chinese imports by US President Donald Trump also apply to Hong Kong, officials say.
 <br>
  <br>
  The confirmation came in a notice from US Customs and Border Protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the vast majority of goods from the SAR are now subject to the extra 10 percent tariffs, on top of regular and other potential extra duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is also affected by Washington's move to end the "de minimis" exemption that meant US shoppers didn't have to pay tariffs for shipments with a retail value of US$800 or less, the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that the US imported US$4.1 billion worth of goods from Hong Kong in 2023, with the duties paid totalling US$58 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the additional 10 percent duty in place, Hong Kong products would have faced US$411.6 million in additional duty liability in 2023, while mainland Chinese products would have faced US$42,081 million in additional duty liability," the HKTDC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council, Willy Lin, said he had been caught off-guard by Hong Kong's inclusion in the latest trade spat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong customs and US customs do work very, very closely together to fight crime and fight drugs etc. We were quite surprised to see that Hong Kong was being labelled," Lin told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a 10 percent tariff is not really detrimental to Hong Kong, but it is reputation-wise," he said, adding that people will question why the SAR is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the extra tariffs, Trump said China needed to stop the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has rejected accusations of complicity in the fentanyl trade and in response to Trump's move it has imposed tariffs of its own on multiple US products, while also announcing it would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.

    Philippine House votes to impeach VP Duturte

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday voted to send articles of impeachment against Vice President Sara Duterte to the Senate, a day before the current congressional session is set to end.
 <br>
  <br>
  While specifics of the impeachment were not divulged, the vote follows the filing of a trio of complaints last month accusing Duterte of crimes ranging from the "brazen misuse" of millions of dollars in public funds to plotting President Ferdinand Marcos's assassination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having been filed by more than one-third of the membership of the House of Representatives, or a total of 215 members ... the motion is approved," House Speaker Martin Romualdez told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's fate now lies in the hands of the Philippines' 24 senators, two-thirds of whom must vote for her impeachment to make it a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  A trial date has yet to be set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's filing comes days before campaigning officially begins for mid-term elections, widely expected to set the table for the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relationship between Duterte and President Marcos is at a nadir, their former alliance giving way to a months-long public battle that has seen the trading of wild accusations, including an alleged death threat that remains under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Marcos had previously urged Congress not to pursue Duterte's impeachment, calling it a "storm in a teacup" that would distract the legislature from its primary responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos's executive secretary Lucas Bersamin, however, said on Monday that the Office of the President would "not interfere" with the impeachment complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte was widely tipped to succeed her father Rodrigo as president in 2022 elections but stepped aside to back Marcos and later ran for vice president on his ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the alliance has since imploded. In November, she delivered an expletive-laden speech saying she had ordered someone to kill Marcos if she herself was assassinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later denied that her comments constituted a death threat, saying she had only been expressing "consternation" with the administration's failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assassination threat was among the allegations included in the last of the three complaints filed against Duterte, lodged December 19 by seven Manila-based Catholic priests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Impeachment is the necessary, ultimate line of defence against corruption at the highest rungs of officialdom," it said. "She cannot be vice president a minute longer." (AFP)

    Toyota raises annual net profit and sales forecasts

<img alt="Toyota Motor raised its full-year operating profit and sales forecast for 2024. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790356_1_20250205143310.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese auto giant Toyota hiked its annual net profit and sales forecasts for the 2024 financial year on Wednesday, saying it now expects net profit of 4.52 trillion yen (US$29.5 billion), up from 3.57 trillion yen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "upward revision incorporates progress in strengthening earning power, backed by improvement efforts including product competitiveness", the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revision reflected efforts to strengthen its earnings power through keeping a lid on incentives, raising prices and stabilising production, Toyota said in presentation materials. It also expects to gain from a weak yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota made the revision even though it posted weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter for which it booked its second successive quarterly profit decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operating profit for the three months through December totalled 1.22 trillion yen, down 28 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent quarters, Toyota's profit was pushed higher by strong hybrid vehicle demand in the US and other major markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  By region, operating income in North America, which includes its top market by vehicle sales, the United States, fell by 63 percent over the first nine months of the financial year mainly due to a decrease in sales volume and higher personnel-related costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operating income in China also declined during that period, pressured by higher marketing costs as the automaker sought to retain market share amid heavy competition from Chinese EV brands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota said it would establish a wholly owned company in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its luxury Lexus brand, with production set to start in 2027 and have an initial capacity of around 100,000 units a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Toyota reported global group unit sales of 10.8 million vehicles for 2024, making it the world's best-selling automaker for a fifth successive year. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not formalise ties with Israel unless a Palestinian state is established, after Israel's prime minister remarked that he thought normalisation with the Gulf kingdom was "going to happen".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Saudi Arabia will continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that," the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have backed Israel and Saudi Arabia having diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riyadh paused tentative talks on the matter early in the Gaza conflict and hardened its rhetoric as the war continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign ministry's statement came swiftly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said establishing formal relations "is not only feasible, I think it's going to happen".
  <br>
  <br>
  His government remains opposed to the internationally backed two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu was speaking at the White House alongside Trump, whose administration in 2020 brokered accords which saw Israel establish relations with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised hopes of a similar deal with Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's richest economy and guardian of Islam's two holiest sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel, but since 2020 has been negotiating rapprochement in exchange for a US defence pact and Washington's help on a civilian nuclear programme. (AFP)

    Broken down train disrupts East Rail Line services

<div class="itemFullText">
 An equipment fault that stranded an engineer's train near Tai Wo MTR Station disrupted services on the East Rail Line on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some stations saw 24-minute intervals between trains during the morning rush hour, with crowd management measures put in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation apologised for the disruption. Shortly after 1pm it said the train had been moved away from the area and normal services were resuming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kim-hung, the railway firm's chief of operations engineering maintenance, said the equipment fault was related to the train's levelling system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found one of the sensors in the levelling system to be faulty, so we had to get it fixed and to make sure that the train can operate safely on the way back," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some passengers RTHK spoke to said the disruption to their journey was minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because I already learned about [the disruption] early in the morning after paying attention to the news before going to work, so there wasn't a problem for me," a woman surnamed Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger surnamed Yim said he expected a bit of a delay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not in a rush, so it isn't much of an issue... I think I'll be half an hour late," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said it asked the railway firm to "make all-out efforts to follow up and complete the necessary maintenance" to resume normal service as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [department's] Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre has been closely monitoring the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts and affected stations," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bus companies beefed up services for some routes in response to the extra passenger demand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands begin voting in the Indian capital’s state legislature election on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party trying to unseat a powerful regional group that has ruled New Delhi for over a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Voters walked to polling booths on a cold, wintry morning to cast their ballots across the sprawling capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manish Sisodia, a key Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, and others offered prayers in a temple before voting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against the AAP, led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built a vast support base on its welfare policies and an anti-corruption movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kejriwal, a popular crusader against corruption, suffered a setback as he himself faced graft allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last election, held in 2020, leaving BJP with only eight and the Congress party with none.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAP had also swept the 2015 state elections, winning 67 seats, with the BJP taking three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi and Kejriwal have both campaigned vigorously in roadshows with thousands of supporters tailing them.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, and a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees (US$25) to poor women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Results are due on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 15 million people are eligible to vote in New Delhi's election. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Wednesday said the number of flu cases was still on the rise and expected the flu season to last until March or April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CHP recorded about 200 serious or death cases involving adults since the start of the year, in which 65 percent of them were elderly people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The controller of the CHP, Edwin Tsui, said the influenza A, sub-type H1, virus is currently circulating in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many Hong Kong people travel abroad. We cannot focus only on the situation in the SAR, we also have to look into the influenza strains in other countries," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Popular tourist destinations, like Japan, South Korea, Europe, North America and the mainland, are currently also having cases of influenza A (H1)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsui expects the number of cases to continue rising, and urged people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the flu season for other countries in January every year. People travel abroad, and when they come back from their holidays, there may be outbreaks at schools and workplaces," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged people to go and see the doctor immediately if they are sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, family doctor Lam Wing-wo said the number of appointments for flu vaccinations doubled after the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said about 20 people have made appointments for flu vaccines every day, and some belonged to the relatively low-risk age group of 18 to 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there is a sufficient supply of vaccines, and urged parents to bring their children to clinics for flu jabs.

    US aid agency places global staff on leave

<img alt="The Trump administration is carrying out plans to fold the USAID humanitarian agency and merge it into the US State Department. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790336_1_20250205112314.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trump administration is placing US Agency for International Development (USAID) direct-hire staffers around the world on leave except those deemed essential, upending the aid agency’s six-decade mission overseas.
 <br>
  <br>
  A notice posted online Tuesday gives the workers 30 days to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had been rumoured for several days and was the most extreme of several proposals considered for consolidating the agency into the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other options had included closures of smaller USAID missions and partial closures of larger ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programmes worldwide shut down after US President Donald Trump imposed a sweeping freeze on foreign assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the space of a few weeks, Trump's political appointees, including tech tycoon Elon Musk’s budget-slashing team, have dismantled the aid agency despite outcry from Democratic lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have ordered a spending stop that has paralysed US-funded aid and development work around the world, gutted the senior leadership and workforce with furloughs and firings, and closed Washington headquarters to staffers Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers said the agency’s computer servers were carted away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk boasted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s teams had taken USAID’s website offline over the weekend and it came back online Tuesday night, with the notice of recall or termination for global staffers its sole post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision to withdraw direct-hire staff and their families earlier than their planned departures will likely cost the government tens of millions of dollars in travel and relocation costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff being placed on leave include both foreign and civil service officers who have legal protection against arbitrary dismissal and being placed on leave without reason. (AP)

    USPS suspends parcels from mainland China, HK

<img alt="The US Postal Service has suspended inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong until further notice. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790330_1_20250205110624.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Postal Service (USPS) said on Tuesday it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong, shortly after President Donald Trump's imposition of fresh tariffs targeting Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The halt will take place "until further notice," and follows Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports starting Tuesday alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change, effective from February 4, will not impact the flow of letters and "flats" from China, according to the USPS website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Wednesday, Beijing denounced the move, calling it "unreasonable suppression".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of principle, I want to point out that we urge the United States to stop politicising trade and economic issues and using them as tools, and to stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular press briefing when asked about the development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump said he was not in a hurry to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, despite expectations that they would hold talks amid the growing trade conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signalled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House on Tuesday, he said he was in "no rush" to talk to Xi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US had imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese goods, which was followed by countermeasures announced by Beijing on Tuesday including tariffs of 10-15 percent on certain American imports. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    Businesses are prepared for latest US tariffs: HKGCC

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Businesses in Hong Kong are prepared for the latest round of 10 percent tariffs that Washington imposed on Beijing, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme on Wednesday, HKGCC CEO Patrick Yeung said the new tariffs would affect the region, as they could disrupt global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in recent years, Hong Kong's exports have actually become very diversified, and the markets that Hong Kong exporters deal with has also been expanded," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in this context, we believe that the Hong Kong export sector is already relatively prepared, at least psychologically, because President Trump has already said that there will be a tariff war, and it's just started right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted with the SAR expanding into new markets, particularly Asean and the Middle East, and achieving positive growth, it has partially helped offset the decline in trade due to the imposition of US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter Chan, Greater China economist at Standard Chartered, told the same show that compared to the previous trade war that took place during Trump's first presidency, Chinese exporters are more prepared this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the tariffs to cause a drop of about one percentage point in Chinese GDP in the coming 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist noted that some Chinese exporters to the US have relocated their factories overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also re-exported to other places to avoid tariffs, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said while market sentiment remains cautious, investors are still hoping there will be positive results from any potential talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

    Australia bans DeepSeek on govt devices

<img alt="Australia's decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790323_1_20250205102715.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices, a top official said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The DeepSeek chatbot - developed by a China-based startup - has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a growing list of countries including South Korea, Italy and France have voiced questions over how the application handles personal data and what information is used to train DeepSeek's AI system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia upped the ante overnight banning DeepSeek from all government devices, one of the toughest moves against the Chinese chatbot yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It's absolutely not a symbolic move," said government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with national broadcaster ABC, Charlton voiced concern that uploaded information "might not be kept private".
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Home Affairs Department issued a directive to government employees overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government," Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must "identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also required that "access, use or installation of DeepSeek products" be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost.

    SAR eyes next-gen wealth owners in family office push

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is looking to tap the next generation of wealth owners in its push to promote the SAR as a place for family offices, according to treasury chief Christopher Hui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for financial services and the treasury also said many family offices have to better allocate their assets in this multipolar world, a trend Hong Kong needs to take note of.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui said the territory has an institute – the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy – catering to successors of affluent families who are set to inherit and manage wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not looking for people who are already in power, but those who will potentially be in leadership roles. [The academy] provides them with exchange opportunities, allowing them to learn about Hong Kong's investment opportunities and management of financial legacies," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said his bureau and data company Bloomberg have teamed up for an initiative, called Hong Kong Family Office Nexus, to lure family offices from around the world to either set up shop in the SAR, or expand their presence here.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bloomberg would hold a wealth management conference that will "create synergy" with the Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit next month, according to Hui.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong is on track to meet the official target of attracting at least 200 new family offices by this year.

    Trump says US should take over Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump predicted on Tuesday that the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, could become "the Riviera of the Middle East" as he announced his plan to take control of it.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so magnificent," Trump said at a joint press conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which he again voiced hopes that Palestinians could be removed from Gaza, and said the United States would redevelop the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love Israel. I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East," Trump told reporters at the White House, without committing to any timetable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as talks are ramping up this week with the promise of surging humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies to help the people of Gaza recover after more than 15 months of devastating conflict. Now Trump wants to push roughly 1.8 million people to leave the land they have called home and claim it for the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump outlined his thinking as he held talks with Netanyahu at the White House, where the two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think people should be going back," Trump said. “You can’t live in Gaza right now. I think we need another location. I think it should be a location that’s going to make people happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the US would take ownership of the Gaza Strip and redevelop it after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and turn the territory into “the Riviera of the Middle East" in which the “world's people” - including Palestinians - would live.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll make sure that it’s done world class," Trump said. "It’ll be wonderful for the people - Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we’re talking about.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt, Jordan and other US allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the US and allies for a two-state solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Trump insists the Palestinians “have no alternative” but to leave the "big pile of rubble” that is Gaza. He spoke out as his top aides stressed that a three-to-five-year timeline for reconstruction of the war-torn territory, as laid out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II dismissed Trump's calls to resettle Gazans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump said he believes Egypt and Jordan - as well as other countries, which he did not name - will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You look over the decades, it’s all death in Gaza,” Trump said. "This has been happening for years. It’s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what’s happening in Gaza.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he isn’t ruling out deploying US troops to support reconstruction of Gaza. He envisions “long-term” US ownership of a redevelopment of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Netanyahu is facing competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and for the 15-month conflict to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. (Agencies)

    Former tennis world number one Halep retires

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former tennis world number one Simona Halep announced her retirement from the sport after her first-round defeat at the WTA Cluj-Napoca tournament in her native Romania.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old lost 6-1, 6-1 to 72nd-ranked Italian Lucia Bronzetti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if it is with joy or sadness that I speak to you but I made this decision in my soul and conscience, I have always been lucid. My body no longer follows, but today I wanted to play and say my goodbyes on the court," Halep told the Romanian crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-time Grand Slam champion, who had been working to re-establish herself after a doping ban, pulled out of Australian Open qualifying last month citing pain in her knee and shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep returned to tennis in March last year after her career had been on hold since October 7, 2022, after testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon singles titles was then caught up in a second affair, over "irregularities" in the data of her biological passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA, but successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), arguing her positive test for roxadustat – used to treat anaemia and banned as a blood doping agent – was the result of a tainted supplement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She denied knowingly doping and her ban was reduced from four years to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she never managed to regain the level that allowed her to rise to the top of the world rankings in October 2017, a position she occupied for a total of 64 weeks in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep won 24 WTA titles over her 19-year career including the French Open in 2018 and Wimbledon in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also played in three other Grand Slam finals – the French Open in 2014 and 2017 and the Australian Open in 2018. (AFP)

    Nepal hikes Everest climb permit costs

<img alt="Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790257_1_20250204210217.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepal has hiked the cost of an Everest climbing permit by a third, arguing it will help tackle pollution and boost safety on the world's highest mountain, the tourism chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fees for the peak spring climbing season will rise from US$11,000 to US$15,000 for a permit to scale the 8,849-metre peak, Narayan Prasad Regmi, director general of the tourism department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cost had remained constant for a decade and it was high time to revise that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Costs of climbing at less popular – and more demanding – times of year such as during winter or the monsoon rains have also risen at similar rates, including from US$5,500 to US$7,500 during the autumn season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 peaks over 8,000 metres and welcomes thousands of climbers each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign climbers already spend tens of thousands of dollars in their attempt to climb Everest, with more than 400 purchasing permits last year, bringing in around US$4 million to government coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The funds are put towards cleaning trash from the mountain left by climbers as well as search and rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mountaineering expedition companies hoped the price hike would not deter climbers, warning some might look to scale Everest through China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some climbers might shift to Tibet where the facilities are much better," said Mingma G Sherpa, who runs the Imagine Nepal mountaineering company, saying the fee must be spent on improving conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our government just increases the royalty, but doesn't do much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It needs to also provide support to the climbers and guides."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nepal has been criticised for allowing too many climbers on Everest while doing little to keep the peak clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Nepal government ordered Everest mountaineers to carry mandatory trackers and carry bags to remove their excrement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee increase was approved by the government in January, but was only published in the national gazette late on Monday. (AFP)

    'About 10' dead in Sweden's deadliest campus shooting

<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 10 people have been killed in a shooting at an adult education centre, Swedish police said, the deadliest attack to take place in Sweden on what the prime minister said was a "painful day" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gunman is believed to be among those killed and a search is continuing at the school for other possible victims, the local police chief told a press conference. The perpetrator's motive was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know that 10 or so people have been killed here today. The reason that we can't be more exact currently is that the extent of the incident is so large," local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest said police believed the gunman had acted alone and that they did not currently suspect terrorism as a motive, though he cautioned that much remained unknown. He said the suspected gunman had not previously been known to police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a big crime scene, we have to complete the searches we are conducting in the school. There are a number of investigative steps we are taking: a profile of the perpetrator, witness interviews ... Obviously, it's a significant amount of work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had opened an investigation into murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence and that the search for possible further victims had continued into the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shooting took place in Orebro, some 200 kilometres west of Stockholm, at the Risbergska school for adults who did not complete their formal education or failed to get the grades to continue to higher education. It is located on a campus that also houses schools for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a very painful day for the whole of Sweden," Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are (also) with all of those whose normal school day was turned into fear. Being locked up in a classroom fearing for your life is a nightmare no one should have to experience." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, shrugging off early weakness while embracing President Trump's moves to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico and taking in stride China's retaliation to US levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment after Trump's 10 percent tariffs came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said markets were taking a "wait and see" view of Trump's trade policy, while regarding earnings as "a positive tailwind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones gained 0.3 percent to 44,556.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 6,037, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 19,654.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan pointed to a more than 20 percent surge in Palantir Technologies that helped boost the Nasdaq.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology company scored a 36 percent jump in revenues based on artificial intelligence growth as its CEO described Palantir as a "software juggernaut."
  <br>
  <br>
  Estee Lauder slumped 16.1 percent after announcing plans to cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs through the end of 2026 as part of a corporate reorganisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  PepsiCo dropped 4.5 percent as it reported flat quarterly sales while the soda and snacks giant works to address "subdued" demand in North America and faces "business disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in certain international markets," as CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a news release. (AFP)

 Authorities on Tuesday announced that the Kai Tak Sports Park's main stadium will officially open on March 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau made the announcement on social media, where it said the 50,000-seat facility will be a “top choice venue” for international sports tournaments and large-scale entertainment events.
  <br>
  <br>
  British band Coldplay will perform there on April 9, 11, and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, about 50,000 people participated in a drill at the sports park on Tuesday night, when the main stadium's retractable roof opened for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They watched a Hong Kong Premier League U22 match between Kitchee and North District.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the roof open, the Environmental Protection Department also monitored audio levels to see if the noise generated at the venue could affect nearby residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism minister Rosanna Law on Tuesday said 4.74 million tourists visited Hong Kong last month, with 3.73 million of them coming from the mainland, setting new single-month records since the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, Law said the figures represent a 24 and 25 percent year-on-year rise respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Hong Kong saw a “good start” in the Year of the Snake after the territory received more than 1.2 million tourists in the first seven days of the mainland’s Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first seven days of this year’s mainland Spring Festival golden week, the visitor arrivals reached nearly 1.25 million, including 1.06 mainland visitors and over 180,000 non-mainland visitors. The overall hotel occupancy rate reached 90 percent,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over 2,000 tour groups had visited Hong Kong including more than 440 tours on Friday, setting the highest single-day record for mainland tour groups visiting Hong Kong,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said bustling crowds were seen at major tourist attractions, with visitors enjoying various districts and taking part in mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that events like the new year fairs, the night parade, fireworks display, horse racing, the LNY Cup, as well as attractions like temples and hiking trails, have brought tourists unique and festive experiences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said she is confident there will be more visitors coming to Hong Kong this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hongkonger who was recently freed from a scam farm in Myanmar is in "good mental and physical condition" and has returned to the SAR on Tuesday, officials confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the woman flew out of Thailand and arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to our understanding, this Hong Kong resident did not pay any ransom," Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen, who was part of the task force, told reporters at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is highly concerned about these cases and have maintained communication with the Hongkongers who need help and their families. We have also collaborated with Thailand, and followed up on the cases with Myanmar and Cambodia," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement released earlier, the Security Bureau said "its dedicated task force met with the Hong Kong resident in Bangkok this morning and was delighted to find that she was in good mental and physical condition".
  <br>
  <br>
  "She expressed gratitude for the active coordination and liaison of the dedicated task force with relevant units of the Thai authorities, as well as for the assistance of different parties that enabled her to return to Hong Kong shortly after her rescue to reunite with her family as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the bureau would continue to actively follow up on the remaining cases of SAR residents still believed to be held captive in Southeast Asia.

    Asteroid has a tiny chance of hitting Earth in 2032

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global space agencies are closely monitoring a building-size space rock that has a tiny chance of hitting Earth seven years from now.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) estimate that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, is around 40 to 100 metres wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ESA said it has an almost 99 percent chance of safely passing Earth on December 22, 2032, but a possible impact could not be entirely ruled out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astronomy expert, Professor Quentin Parker from the University of Hong Kong, said if the asteroid hits Earth, it would cause a devastating impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a 10 megaton nuclear explosion on that city. But the likelihood is, given that two-thirds of the Earth's surface is water, it'll go into the ocean... creating a small tsunami, which actually could be quite dangerous to landfall around where that occurred," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it hits in a desert, or in an unpopulated region, it'll devastate the surrounding region up to maybe several tens of kilometres in terms of graded damage from the epicentre to the edge where the damage is completely catastrophic at the impact site, then drops off as you get further away."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said there are still many unknowns and scientists could make more accurate estimations when the asteroid comes closer to Earth again in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to study because it has a very elliptical orbit. It goes very far away and comes close. You can only study when it comes close. When it comes close again in 2028, we'll be able to refine the orbit again even further," Parker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing we can do in terms of sending out a rocket at the moment to deflect it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The asteroid now stands at the top of the ESA's asteroid risk list and Nasa's automated Sentry risk list, which include any known asteroids with a non-zero probability of colliding with Earth.

    Cut taxes to get international stars to HK: institute

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Taxation Institute on Tuesday urged Financial Secretary Paul Chan to provide more tax incentives to attract international singers and sports stars to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the budget later this month, the institute proposed a 50 percent reduction in tax rates for non-local entertainers and sportspeople, and a tax deduction of up to 200 percent for filming activities in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ada Ma, a council member of the institute, said these measures would boost the hotel and retail sectors and promote the new Kai Tak stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we talked about a lot of entertainers or sportspeople who went to Singapore or other countries to hold concerts. And there's some debate about why they don't come to Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just want to encourage them to come to Hong Kong from a tax angle, not just to compare with other countries, but we also want to promote our stadium in Kai Tak and also other businesses in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute also suggested that the top marginal salaries tax rate be lowered to 16 percent from 17 percent, and that the standard tax rate be increased from 16 to 17 percent for those earning above HK$5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winnie Shek, the institute's president, said they would also like to see the waiving of stamp duty for first-time homebuyers for properties up to HK$6.5 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the proposal that we advocate to improve the livelihood of Hong Kong general public. So the Hong Kong general public, probably the younger generation in Hong Kong, are still experiencing difficulties in buying their first home," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an estimated HK$100 billion fiscal deficit this year, the institute said it's not the best time to introduce new taxes given the uncertain global economic landscape.

<img alt="Chris Tang said the legal changes would further clarify the criminal liability of such a serious offence." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790219_1_20250204160658.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it plans to double the maximum penalty for illegally manufacturing and trafficking firearms to up to 20 years behind bars.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is to bring local laws in line with a United Nations firearms protocol, which began to apply in the country, including the SAR, early last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang said to reflect the seriousness of the crime, officials plan to make manufacturing firearms, their components and ammunition a separate offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No person should manufacture firearms or ammunition unless they're doing it by way of trade or business, or holds a dealer's licence. As this may be a national security threat, we will enhance the prison term to 20 years instead of 10," he said at a security panel meeting at the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told lawmakers that in the past five years, the authorities uncovered complete firearms on 12 occasions, while detecting two cases of firearm manufacturing and three cases of illegal imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the new offence would cover those who use 3D printing techniques to manufacture a legitimate firearm, while those who print air guns without a licence could be subject to punishment under existing laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government plans to table a bill to the legislature in April, and complete the legal changes within this year.

    China announces countermeasures over US tariff hikes

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry says the US tariff increase seriously violates World Trade Organization rules. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790206_1_20250204135146.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced countermeasures after higher US tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it would slap tariffs of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas products from the US, and 10 percent on imports of crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after 10 percent levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods took effect at 1pm Beijing time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The US’s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization," a Commerce Ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs on US goods will come into force next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry and its Customs Administration also said China is imposing export controls on tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, molybdenum and ruthenium-related items to "safeguard national security interests".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it would probe US tech giant Google on suspicion of violating anti-monopoly laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Google is suspected of violating the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People's Republic of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched an investigation into Google in accordance with the law," the administration said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also added two US firms to its "unreliable entity list".
  <br>
  <br>
  They are PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said the two firms "have violated normal market trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies, thus severely harming their legitimate rights and interests," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization "to defend its legitimate rights and interests" in response to hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese response was “measured,” said John Gong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think they want the trade war escalating," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management said in a note: "I think the retaliation is not aggressive, as China only targets some US products, in response to the US tariff on all China's exports to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate." (Agencies)

 Shares in Hong Kong rallied more than three percent in the morning session, in line with an advance across Asian markets after Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada reached deals to delay US tariffs for a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rallied 3.11 percent in the morning session, or 629 points, to 20,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were sent tumbling on Monday after the US president at the weekend signed off 25 percent duties against Mexico and Canada, fanning concerns for the stuttering global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors were given a much-needed shot in the arm after the Trump administration said it had struck deals with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on immigration and fentanyl, and would postpone the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added he would hold talks with Beijing "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.

 People wrapped up warm on Tuesday as local temperatures fell to 12 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said districts like Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin saw temperatures lower than that.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said an intense northeast monsoon is bringing cold weather to the coast of Guangdong, which is why temperatures dipped on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man told RTHK he wasn't too bothered by the colder weather, but made sure he wrapped up warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very cold. It's much colder than I expected, but it's still pleasant right now. I've got to make sure I'm wearing two to three layers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another person hoped it would get warmer again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't like this. I feel more comfortable with warmer weather," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection reminded the public, especially the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, to protect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Elderly people have less insulating fat beneath their skin to keep them warm, and their body temperature control mechanisms may be weaker. Their body may not be able to appropriately respond to the cold weather," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said temperatures would rise slightly in the coming few days, but would drop again over the weekend.

    El Salvador offers to jail Americans: Marco Rubio

<img alt="US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele as the pair discussed the transfer of prisoners from America to El Salvador. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790192_1_20250204114042.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 El Salvador's leader has made the offer to jail Americans sent by their own country, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  There is virtually no precedent in contemporary times for a democratic country to send its own citizens to foreign jails, and any attempt to do so is sure to be challenged in US courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rubio welcomed an offer to do just that by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose sweeping crackdown on crime has won him soaring popularity at home and hero status for many in US President Donald Trump's orbit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has offered to house in his jails dangerous American criminals in custody in our country, including those with US citizenship and legal residency," Rubio told reporters in San Salvador.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's ever made an offer of friendship such as this," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are profoundly grateful. I spoke to President Trump about this earlier today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said that Bukele was also willing to take back Salvadoran citizens as well as nationals of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio appeared to suggest that the prison transfer would focus on members of Latin American gangs, such as El Salvador's MS-13 and Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, who have acquired US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal -- MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be -- he has offered his jails," Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his return to the White House last month, Trump has put a top priority on speeding up the deportation of millions of people in the United States without legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has sought to crack down on the right to birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the US Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also unveiled plans to detain 30,000 migrants at the US base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- a prison which previous Democratic presidents hoped to close. (AFP)

    Wang, Rubio could meet in two weeks in New York

<div class="itemFullText">
 A United Nations Security Council meeting in two weeks could be a "very good opportunity" for Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to meet, China's UN envoy said on Monday, stressing the need for cooperation because "so much is at stake," while blasting Washington on tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is president of the Security Council for February, and China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong said Wang would chair a ministerial meeting of the 15-member body on February 18 that would focus on multilateralism and improving global governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Rubio would attend the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and Rubio have spoken on the phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do hope that despite all the rhetoric that we have heard from the American politicians, we can take a constructive and – I will emphasise – a professional approach to our work here in the United Nations," Fu told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So much is at stake."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he did not hold back on US President Donald Trump's decision to impose 10 percent tariffs on China from Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly opposed to this unwarranted increase and we do believe that this is in violation of the WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. So that's why China is filing a complaint at this WTO," Fu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may be forced to take counter measures... there is no winner in a trade war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suspended his threat of steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the two neighbouring countries. No such deal has emerged for China, and a White House spokesperson said Trump would not be speaking with President Xi Jinping until later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fu also said China and the US could cooperate on combating climate change, drugs and terrorism and work together on technology like AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said fragmentation on AI would enhance risk and reduce benefits. (Reuters)

    Lawmakers urge govt departments to cut spending

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Tuesday said government departments should study ways to reduce spending to tackle a fiscal deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang told a radio programme that the government should review the size and work of the civil service to save public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, among more than 2,000 civil servants in the Labour Department, around 600 of them are working on employment services, which are not related to law enforcement. For employment services, shouldn't we consider outsourcing them to the third sector?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the Labour Department spends around HK$600 to HK$800 million annually on employment services, but some work could be delegated to non-profit organisations instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said the administration should look for ways to cut spending on education and healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our birth rate is very low. We now have around half as many children as we did a decade ago. But we don't see primary education fees being reduced by half. Instead, it keeps going up every year. We need to look into this," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether HK$2 subsidised transport fares for the over 60s should be adjusted, Tang said he thinks distance-based fares should be implemented instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Shiu said officials could consider setting usage limits or excluding some people still in work from getting the subsidised fares, depending on which sector they are employed in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan will deliver his budget speech on February 26.

    'China's approach to tariffs contrasts with the US'

<img alt="Analysts believe any potential Chinese countermeasures against US tariffs would be related to the military and tech sectors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790179_1_20250204102142.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political commentator said China’s move to file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the Trump administration's tariff threats aims to create a contrast to the US's practice of dealing with things.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had announced a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties, a measure which was supposed to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held out the prospect of a deal with an announcement on Monday that talks between Beijing and Washington on tariffs would happen within "the next 24 hours".
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that Beijing is "colouring within the lines of the international order" by turning to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the US has not allowed any appellate judges to be appointed since the Obama administration. That means that they can't render a final decision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I think China is trying to create a stark contrast between what it's willing to do and Donald Trump who seems to... he likes colouring outside the lines. He likes to be brash, bold. He likes to threaten people. And though he generally will pivot on a dime if things aren’t going well, it's still a very marked contrast between two different responses."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Beijing has yet to impose any countermeasures, Tangen believes they could be related to military and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, China has a very large position in the rare earths area, it's indicated before, and has imposed some restrictions on that. You have to register to get some of the... rare earths and things like that. And they said they're not going to export them for military use. And I see that probably is where they're going to concentrate," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Regina Ip said Hong Kong has to be more flexible in dealing with incoming challenges, saying the fact that Mexico and Canada were able to delay the imposition of tariffs on their goods underlines the importance of engaging with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, you need to engage. On the other hand, you need to strengthen yourself and have an arsenal of tools to respond if necessary," Ip told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has much less leverage being only an SAR. But we have full backing from our country. I think we need to be more nuanced and be more flexible in our approach when we deal with these sort of great power threats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who chairs the New People's Party, said people doing business in the Hong Kong are more concerned about interest rates than tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want interest rates to come down to lessen the debt burden on many of our investors, including property tycoons. The continued trend of lowering interest rates would spur our economic growth. We hope the [US Federal Reserve] would resume the downward trend of interest rates if a trade war could be avoided," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City signed Nico González from Porto in the biggest move from Premier League clubs on transfer deadline day, while Bayern Munich's Mathys Tel headed to Tottenham on loan.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's midfield frailties without Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who is out for the season due to a serious knee injury, were exposed in a 5-1 thrashing at Arsenal on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men find themselves in a battle just to qualify for next season's Champions League, with the defending champions sitting fourth in the Premier League, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  City were also in need of reinforcements for a blockbuster Champions League play-off round tie against holders Real Madrid later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Barcelona midfielder González, 23, arrives for a reported fee of US$62 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the perfect opportunity for me at this stage of my career," said González. "I know the reputation Pep has and I cannot wait to work with him. In fact, I am honoured he wants me to play in his team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham were busy in the final hours of the window as they bolstered Ange Postecoglou's injury-ravaged squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tel reportedly turned down the opportunity to join Spurs earlier in the window after a deal was agreed with the German giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the French under-21 international has now moved to north London until the end of the season with an option to make the move permanent in the summer. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich has announced they had extended the contract of their long-standing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to the end of the 2025 to 2026 season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement puts an end to speculation about Neuer's future at the Bundesliga club, where his contract was set to expire at the end of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who has made over 500 appearances for the Bavarian giants, was "the best goalkeeper of his generation and a Bayern icon", sporting chief Max Eberl said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club were "delighted" that Neuer would stay on for what will be his 15th season with Bayern, after joining from domestic rivals Schalke in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer said in the statement he wanted to keep playing football and "remain a Bayern player" for the upcoming season.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 11 Bundesliga titles and two Champions League trophies with the club, Neuer said he was "still hungry" for more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who retired from international football last year after Germany hosted the Euros, has recently returned from injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's stalwart broke a rib in a collision in December during a match against Bayer Leverkusen, which sidelined him through the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old had previously expressed his desire to keep playing beyond the end of the year, despite growing competition for his spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Nuebel, who has a contract with Bayern until 2029 but is currently on loan at Stuttgart until 2026, is widely believed to be in line to replace Neuer in Munich. (AFP)

    Trump says he's pausing tariffs on Canada after talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump delayed the start of tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month on Monday after America's neighbours struck last-minute deals to tighten border measures against the flow of migrants and the drug fentanyl.
 <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets had slumped as Trump's threat of sweeping 25 percent levies on exports from Canada and Mexico to the United States sparked fears of a global trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after calls with Trump just hours before the US tariffs were due to take effect, both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum struck deals for a postponement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that after "very friendly" talks with Sheinbaum he'd "immediately pause" the tariffs on Mexico, and that his counterpart had agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions appeared higher between the US and Canada, but after two separate calls Trump later said he was "very pleased" and was announcing a 30-day halt in the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks on final deals would continue with both countries, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said after the "good call" that Canada deploy nearly 10,000 frontline officers to help secure the border, list drug cartels as terrorists, appoint a "Fentanyl Czar" and crack down on money laundering.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear the real extent of the changes on the Canadian border, given that just this December authorities there said they already had 8,500 personnel deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  China remains in the firing line for Trump tariffs. It faces a further 10 percent duty on top of existing levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said last-minute talks between Washington and Beijing will likely be held "probably in the next 24 hours" to avoid new tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, China and Mexico are the United States's three biggest trading partners, and Trump's threatened tariffs have sent shock waves through the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's three main indices fell sharply in early deals, but clawed back ground after Trump's announcement on the Mexico deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a trade war, this is a drug war," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC, complaining that "the Canadians appeared to have misunderstood the plain language."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada had vowed to respond strongly to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its most populous province Ontario on Monday had banned US firms from bidding on tens of billions of dollars in government contracts -- and dumped a deal with Trump ally Elon Musk's Starlink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upped the pressure recently by calling Canada's existence into question -- once again calling on Monday for it to become the 51st US state.
  <br>
  <br>
  A political crisis in the Canadian government over Trump's tariff threats led to Trudeau announcing earlier this month that he would quit too. Canadians now face elections as early as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president -- who has said that tariff is the "most beautiful word in the dictionary" -- is going even further in his second term on the levies than he did in his first.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has insisted that the impact would be borne by foreign exporters without being passed on to American consumers, despite most experts saying the contrary.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the billionaire 78-year-old did acknowledge as he returned from a weekend at his Florida resort Sunday that Americans might feel economic "pain".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also wielded tariffs as a threat to achieve his wider policy goals, most recently when he said he would slap them on Colombia when it turned back US military planes carrying deported migrants. (AFP)

    Resilient Chelsea impress in comeback against West Ham

<div class="itemFullText">
 Enzo Maresca hailed Chelsea's mental strength as they came from behind to beat West Ham 2-1 and move into fourth place in the Premier League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maresca's side trailed to Jarrod Bowen's strike late in the first half at Stamford Bridge, sparking jeers from frustrated fans after a lethargic start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca's decision to send on Pedro Neto in the second half proved decisive as the Portugal forward bagged Chelsea's equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has been so often over the last two seasons, Cole Palmer was the catalyst for the Blues' 74th-minute winner when his cross deflected in off West Ham defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a disappointing run of one win in seven league games, Maresca was relieved to see Chelsea get back on track in spirited fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is huge. Today was a tough game, especially mentally. When West Ham come here and sit back with 10 players behind the ball, it's not easy. You have to be mentally strong and you need to be patient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had more than 10 shots in the first half," he added. "We had clear chances in the first half but unfortunately, we missed the target. With some changes the game changed. Overall we completely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca has been concerned that his players were distracted by speculation over potential transfers in and out of Stamford Bridge leading up to Monday's deadline day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relieved that the window would be closed, the Italian can focus on leading Chelsea's fight to qualify for next season's Champions League via a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good weekend for us in terms of results and we knew today was even better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are there and hopefully we can be there until the end," he added. "Playing this kind of game in February, where we are still there, is an important statement." (AFP)

    US stocks join global markets' retreat on tariff news

<img alt="Wall Street closed lower amid global falls in the wake of the Trump Administration's imposition of tariffs on major trading partners.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended lower on Monday, following falls in overseas markets after US President Trump announced tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump later modified his weekend tariff announcement, suspending the levies on Mexico for 30 days following talks with his Mexican counterpart.
  <br>
  <br>
  But all three major US indices still ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 0.3 percent to 44,421.91.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.8 percent to 5,994.57, and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.2 percent to 19,391.96.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs are "considered a cost that will likely push prices higher and growth lower," said Jack Ablin of Cresset capital, who noted Trump has threatened tariffs on other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is adapting not just to more tariffs, but more headline risk," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's session underscored the greater exposure of some sectors to tariffs compared with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those falling were automakers like General Motors, down 3.2 percent, homebuilders such as Lennar, down 3.9 percent, and agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co., down two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reaction in other sectors was muted. Companies in finance, insurance and telecommunications, either advanced or experienced small declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from trade talks, key events this week include quarterly earnings from Google parent Alphabet and Ford, and US jobs data. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk, the world's richest person and US President Donald Trump's controversial close advisor, said on Monday the giant USAID humanitarian agency will be "shutting down" as part of his drive to shrink the US government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hours later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated it was not disappearing but would come under his control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the acting director of USAID," Rubio told reporters on a visit to El Salvador, accusing the agency of "insubordination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid confusion over the future of the US Agency for International Development, employees were instructed by email not to go to their offices Monday. Some 600 staffers found themselves locked out of their computer systems, ABC News reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID is the aid arm of US foreign policy, funding health and emergency programs in around 120 countries, including the world's poorest regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also seen as a source of soft power for US foreign policy, which Musk accused of being "corrupt" and involved in an array of political activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SpaceX and Tesla CEO, who has massive contracts with the US government and was the biggest financial backer of Trump's campaign, said he had personally cleared the unprecedented move with the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went over with him in detail, and he agreed that we should shut it down," Musk said in a discussion on his X online platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Musk's aides have taken control of the US Treasury Department's payments system - which manages trillions of dollars of transactions each year -- sparking alarm among critics. (AFP)

    Trump confirms one-month 'pause' in Mexico tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on Mexico for one month after last-minute talks on Monday, but there was no breakthrough yet in negotiations with Canada on an issue that has sparked fears of a global trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  As world markets slumped, Trump and his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum both announced the halt in the levies after she agreed to send 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border following talks on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on his Truth Social network that after the "very friendly conversation" he had "agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period."
  <br>
  <br>
  During that time there would be further talks "as we attempt to achieve a 'deal' between our two Countries," the Republican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leftist Sheinbaum had announced the tariff pause a few minutes earlier, saying she had a "good conversation with President Trump with great respect for our relationship and sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump agreed to increase measures to prevent trafficking of US weapons into Mexico, she said, a point that did not appear in Trump's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development came hours before the 25 percent levies that Trump has ordered on imports from the US neighbors and chief trading partners, plus an extra 10 percent on China, were due to take effect at midnight on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he had also spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday and was due to speak again, but the White House said negotiations with Ottawa were not going as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump repeated his frequent claims that the United States is being unfairly treated by trade while pushing his argument that the tariffs were about a "drug war" from opioids "pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  US government figures show that only a minimal quantity of drugs comes via Canada. (AFP)

    Greece's Santorini on alert after seismic activity

<img alt="Dust rises following a landslide during high seismic activity on Santorini. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790129_1_20250203220204.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands – all popular summer vacation destinations – after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,” Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rock slides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,” Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late on Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. “We urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimise risk.”
  <br>
  <br>
  While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini’s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.
  <br>
  <br>
  The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency – an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried," said Michalis Gerontakis, who is also the director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,” Gerontakis said. "When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can knows what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog," said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different," said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I need to get away for a few days until things calm down,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I wasn’t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer," Fragiadakis said. "I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.” (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2024, officials said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure matched government forecasts, but was down from the 3.2 percent growth recorded in 2023.

  Figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed a relatively faster pace of growth in the last quarter of 2024 – at 2.4 percent year-on-year – compared to 1.9 percent in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the economy is expected to register further growth in 2025, despite heightened uncertainties in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said while US "protectionist policies" could affect Hong Kong's exports, supportive measures from Beijing will help offset some of the impact and the authorities will continue to take various measures to spur growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, an economics professor at Chinese University, said the city's latest growth was partially driven by stimulus measures from Beijing last September, as well as supportive policies in Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fourth quarter performance was actually much better than the third quarter's, basically it was driven by the exports of services and also by the government expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you look at the consumption and also investment, they dropped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said falling retail sales are among the most concerning components weighing on the SAR's growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, we may [also] expect some reductions in the export sectors, because of the trade tensions between the US and other economies like China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said he expects Hong Kong's annual economic growth to swing between two and four percent in the coming year, as a declining property sector gradually stabilises due to interest rate cuts boosting transaction volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that the property markets have reached the bottom and the sector will bounce back in the first half of 2025," he said, adding that the city's stock markets are also picking up steam.
