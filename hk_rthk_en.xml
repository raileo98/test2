<div class="itemFullText">
 Meta will start using public posts and comments by its European users to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) models from May 27, unless users opt out of the data-mining project.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said earlier this week that it would develop its AI models with European users' public content and conversations with the Meta AI chatbot.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means anything from Instagram photo captions to Facebook comments could soon be fair game for Meta AI, though private conversations via its WhatsApp messaging service will be excluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a privacy notice, this will begin on May 27, though it says users can choose to keep their content out after this date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta users should receive a notification ahead of the May 27 deadline informing them of the policy change and providing a link to the opt-out form.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Meta said it could continue to process information by users when they appear in a publicly shared image or are mentioned by another person.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would not apply to the accounts of users under 18, nor to private messages sent to family and friends, Meta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI is an overriding priority for Mark Zuckerberg-owned Meta as for other technology giants, hoping to match the success of ChatGPT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group plans to invest US$60 to US$65 billion this year, with much of the cash going into data centres, servers and network infrastructure necessary to develop AI models. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tariffs are likely to push up prices and could put the US Federal Reserve in the unenviable position of having to choose between tackling inflation and unemployment, the bank's chair said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Unlike some other central banks, the US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to ensure both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment over time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It keeps those twin objectives in balance by lowering or raising interest rates, which act as either a throttle or a brake for demand in the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to prepared remarks, warning that the inflationary effects "could also be more persistent."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored," he added, echoing similar remarks earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said that the Fed could find itself in the "challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension," noting that price stability is a necessary precondition for "strong labour market conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's stop-start tariff policy has unnerved investors and trading partners unsure about the long-term policy, and what it might mean for international trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most economists have warned that tariffs will push up prices – at least temporarily – while acting as a drag on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has insisted that the levies are just one part of an overall economic platform, including tax cuts and deregulation designed to stimulate supply, boost growth, temper inflation, and return manufacturing jobs to the United States. (AFP)

<img alt='WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says the body must "streamline its decision-making." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800694_1_20250417021537.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global trade is expected to plummet this year in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff offensive, fuelling uncertainty that threatens "severe negative consequences" for the world, the World Trade Organisation warned on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to office, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff on imports of goods from around the world along with 25 percent levies on steel, aluminium and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump made a U-turn on steeper tariffs for dozens of countries, he has escalated a trade war with China, slapping 145 percent levies on Chinese goods while Beijing retaliated with a 125 percent duty on US products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very concerned," WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters, adding that the organisation expected to see trade volumes between the United States and China crumble by a whopping 81 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular," she warned in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the year, the WTO expected to see global trade expand in 2025 and 2026, with merchandise trade seen growing in line with global GDP, and trade in services growing even faster.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the organisation's annual global trade outlook published on Wednesday, it determined that as things stand, world merchandise trade is on course to fall 0.2 percent this year, "before posting a modest recovery of 2.5 percent in 2026."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 number, calculated in line with the tariff situation on April 14, is already nearly three percentage points lower than what would have been expected without the tariffs Trump has slapped on countries around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Okonjo-Iweala told reporters the "sharp projected decline in US-China bilateral trade" risked more "far-reaching consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  While US-China trade accounts for just around three percent of world merchandise trade, she warned that what appears to be the ongoing "decoupling of the two economies" could lead to "a broader fragmentation of the global economy along geopolitical lines into two isolated blocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  In that scenario, "our estimates suggest that global ... GDP would be lowered by nearly seven percent in the long term," by 2040, she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel announced on Wednesday that it had converted 30 percent of Gaza's territory into a buffer zone as it pressed its unrelenting military offensive, vowing to maintain its blockade on humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas that had largely halted hostilities, with rescuers on Wednesday saying at least 11 were killed in strikes across the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN said an estimated 500,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the Gaza ceasefire, triggering what it described as one of the most severe humanitarian crises the territory has faced in more than 18 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military on Wednesday said that as part of its resumed operations, it had "achieved full operational control over several key areas and routes throughout the Gaza Strip".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Approximately 30 percent of the Gaza Strip's territory is now designated as an Operational Security Perimeter."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Israeli air strikes had hit "approximately 1,200 terror targets" and that "more than 100 targeted eliminations have been carried out" since March 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Minister Israel Katz had declared earlier this month that the military was seizing "large areas" of Gaza, leaving it "smaller and more isolated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed that military pressure was the only way to force Hamas to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Campaigners say there are "no excuses" for allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports events, after a landmark legal decision in Britain on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court, the UK's highest court, ruled that the legal definition of a "woman" is based on a person's sex at birth and does not include transgender women who hold a gender recognition certificate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision is a significant victory for gender-critical rights campaigners and could have implications for participation criteria related to women's sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fiona McAnena, director of campaigns at the charity Sex Matters, welcomed the ruling, saying it was crucial for fairness and safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are now no excuses for sports governing bodies that are still letting trans-identifying men into the women's category," she told the PA news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judges mentioned fairness in sport this morning. The law was always clear that everyone male can be excluded to provide fair, safe sport for women and girls, but some people claimed it was unkind or complicated to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's neither of those – it's essential for fairness and safety for everyone female."
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgender participation has become a hot-button issue as different sports try to balance inclusivity with ensuring fair competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  International governing bodies in a number of sports, including cycling, swimming and athletics, have tightened policies to effectively ban transgender competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in women's sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former British swimmer Sharron Davies, who won an Olympic silver medal at the Moscow Games in 1980, has been outspoken over the issue, saying transgender athletes should not compete in women's sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's just really important that we can define what a woman is," Davies said, adding it was time for sports bodies to "protect every female athlete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't mean to say that we can't respect people across the whole of society, however they wish to present themselves," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My position was always one that, biologically, women are very different from men." (AFP)

<img alt="A diplomatic source says Marco Rubio and France's Foreign Minister will discuss " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800684_1_20250416224136.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was headed on Wednesday to Paris for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, his office said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said Rubio was travelling with US envoy Steve Witkoff to meet European officials on the goal of stopping the war triggered by Russia's military offensive in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  A French diplomatic source said Rubio and France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot would discuss "the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and the Iranian nuclear file".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's push for a ceasefire has yet to bear fruit, and a deadly Russian strike Sunday on Ukraine's Sumy showed how the war is still taking a hefty toll, even as peace efforts are under way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff said on Monday, three days after holding his third meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, that he himself sees a peace deal "emerging".
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks to end the Gaza war have also stalled, with Israel saying on Wednesday it would keep blocking humanitarian aid from entering the Palestinian territory, where a relentless military offensive has turned the Palestinian territory into a "mass grave", according to medical charity Doctors Without Borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said blocking aid to the besieged territory of 2.4 million people was a means of pressure on Palestinian militant group Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris talks also come as discussions between the United States and Iran on Tehran's nuclear programme were held on Saturday in Oman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another round is scheduled for April 19, also in Oman. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia will work together on trade, the economy and investment, President Xi Jinping and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a bilateral meeting, Xi said he was willing to promote development of Chinese and Malaysian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am willing to work with you to continue to promote the development of the China-Malaysia community with a shared future in a high-level strategic direction, create more benefits for the people of the two countries, make greater contributions to regional prosperity and stability, and make the friendship between China and Malaysia from generation to generation more prosperous," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Malaysia also reached a consensus on deepening cooperation in various fields, Xi said after witnessing the exchange of 31 agreements with the Malaysian Prime Minister, ranging from trade and tourism to railway transportation and agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the face of shocks to the current international order and economic globalisation, our two nations will stand united with other countries in the region to jointly resist the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, overcome the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism, and safeguard the promising prospects for development in our shared Asian home," Xi said at a function with Anwar.

  Anwar for his part had said the two nations will collaborate in fields including artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only [are you the] president of a great country, the People's Republic of China, but [you are] a true friend ...We will work together in various fields of endeavour, including the economy, trade, investments, and, of course, new technology, including the AI initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Malaysia as part of a three-nation Southeast Asian trip to consolidate ties with some of the nation's closest neighbours as trade tensions with the United States escalate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Xi met with Malaysia's king, Sultan Ibrahim, in a colourful ceremony at the golden-domed Istana palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV reported that during the meeting, Xi pointed out that the two countries are good neighbours, friends and partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have frequent exchanges and are as close as one family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This visit at your invitation is not only to fulfill our appointment a year ago to meet in Kuala Lumpur, but also to jointly work with you to usher in a new 'Golden 50 Years' in China-Malaysia relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaysia is the second stop of Xi's five-day, three-nation Southeast Asian tour, which began with a two-day Vietnam state visit. His next stop is Cambodia. (Reuters/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle maker XPeng said it is ramping up technological innovation as part of efforts to further expand into the overseas market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comment came as the Guangzhou-headquartered firm introduced the latest version of its X9 multi-purpose vehicle to the SAR market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-seater is equipped with autonomous driving capabilities powered by its own artificial intelligence chip, and the firm plans to take orders from Europe from the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference held at Kai Tak, XPeng's founder He Xiaopeng said AI technology is key to the company's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The technology of artificial intelligence has driven the industrial changes for automobiles. And this change, I believe, will lead to all auto firms to establish their own software platforms and greatly increase their research and development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The XPeng founder said the China auto market is highly competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a sense I am actually quite concerned about the car companies in China. For now there are about 400 to 500 car makers in China. I believe in the end, there'll only be about 10 or fewer that can survive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He predicts half of the firm's EV sales will come from the overseas markets in the coming decade, up from 15 percent currently.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EV entrepreneur also said he believes more Chinese brands will enter the global market in the future, with each firm eyeing about 10 to 12 core markets that span across Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Right now, the firm has a presence in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and it hopes to double that number by the end of the year, with Hong Kong being a launch pad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the impact of US tariffs, XPeng said it has not sold any EVs in the country but that it will continue to monitor development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a company, we cannot escape the economic volatility that came with the trade tensions. We need to be prepared to make sure that our products continue to sell well," said Brian Gu, the firm's vice chairman and president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we also need to be prepared that the tariffs may have an impact on the global supply chains."
  <br>
  <br>
  XPeng is also investing in the development of robotics and flying vehicles, in a bid to capitalise on the growing low-altitude economy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German prosecutors said on Wednesday they charged a Berlin palliative care doctor with the murder of 15 patients, alleging he acted out of a "lust" for killing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 40-year-old suspect is accused of having killed 12 women and three men between September 2021 and July 2024 using a deadly cocktail of sedatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  German press reports identify the suspect as Johannes M, but prosecutors have not released a name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The doctor allegedly "administered an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant to his patients... without their knowledge or consent", the Berlin prosecutor's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relaxant "paralysed the respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory arrest and death within minutes".
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims, who were all receiving care at the time, were aged between 25 and 94 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  On five occasions, prosecutors alleged that the suspect had "set fire to their apartments to cover up these killings".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list of accusations against the suspect has grown in length and severity since his initial arrest in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was originally held on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to four deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors subsequently said in November they were treating the alleged killings as murder cases, adding four more deaths to the list of accusations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," prosecutors said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect had nothing other than a "lust for murder", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said they were seeking a "lifelong professional ban" and called for the suspect to be locked in "preventative detention".
  <br>
  <br>
  A special team of investigators had identified a total of 395 suspicious cases that needed to re-examined in light of the accusations against the doctor. (AFP)

<img alt="About 10 outlets follow the US president wherever he goes, whether it is a meeting in the Oval Office or trips at home or abroad. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800653_1_20250416174532.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wire services including Reuters and Bloomberg News will no longer hold a permanent slot in the small pool of reporters who cover US President Donald Trump, the White House has said, as it moves to exert greater control over who gets to ask him questions and report on his statements in real time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes after the Trump administration last week lost a court challenge brought by another wire service, the Associated Press, over its earlier exclusion from the press pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pool typically consists of about 10 outlets that follow the US president wherever he goes, whether it is a meeting in the Oval Office where he makes statements or answers questions, or trips at home or abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new policy, wire services will lose their customary spot in the pool and will instead be part of a larger rotation with about 30 other newspaper and print outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given their mission to deliver real-time information to other news organisations and readers, wire services tend to cover the US president and the White House more closely on a daily basis than most outlets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other media customers, particularly local news organisations that have no presence in Washington, rely on the wires for up-to-date reporting, video and audio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reuters news coverage reaches billions of people each day, mostly through the thousands of news organisations around the world that subscribe to Reuters services," a Reuters spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential to democracy that the public have access to independent, impartial and accurate news about their government. Any steps by the US government to limit access to the president threatens that principle, both for the public and the world’s media."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters remains committed to covering the White House in an impartial, accurate and independent way, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And AP said the administration's actions were a grave disservice to the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to restrict the access of all wire services, whose fast and accurate White House coverage informs billions of people every single day, rather than reinstate The Associated Press to the wire pool," spokesperson Lauren Easton said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until the current administration, the three wire services – AP, Bloomberg and Reuters – were all standard members of the pool. But the White House barred AP in February after it refused to refer to the body of water south of the United States as the "Gulf of America" as Trump had ordered it be called. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Kingdom's top court on Wednesday upheld an appeal by a campaign group on whether transgender women are legally women under equality legislation, ruling that the law referred to a "biological woman and biological sex".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court's judgment related to whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document which gives legal recognition of someone's new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain's Equality Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campaign group For Women Scotland had argued those rights should only apply based on a person's biological sex, and had challenged guidance issued by the devolved Scottish government over a 2018 law that was designed to increase the proportion of women on public sector boards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish ministers' guidance on that law stated that a trans woman with a full GRC was legally a woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The terms women and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex, but we counsel against reading this judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in our society at the expense of another – it is not," Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court. (Reuters)

<img alt="According to an RTHK source, metered parking spaces could be increased to HK$4 per 15 minutes, double the current rate.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Motorists may soon have to pay HK$400 for an illegal parking ticket, a 25 percent increase, while metered parking spaces could cost HK$4 per 15 minutes, double the current rate, according to an RTHK source.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK has also learnt that fines for speeding and other traffic infringements could cost 50 percent more, as the government aims to improve road safety and enforcement efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final proposal is expected to be unveiled next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post published on Wednesday, the Transport and Logistics Bureau pointed out that the fixed penalties for traffic contraventions have remained unchanged for over three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fines were "significantly lower" than other regions in the world, the bureau added, citing examples in Singapore, London and the Australian state of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted a rise in dangerous behaviour such as speeding, not following road markings, and using mobile phones while driving, suggesting a need to raise fines to create a greater deterrence effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also believe bumping up metered parking charges would deter drivers from circling the streets to look for a space.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have at the same time pledged to increase off-street parking to cater to growing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, owners of private electric cars could see the cost of driving go up further, as the bureau is looking to increase their licence fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate Facebook post, the bureau noted owners of such vehicles on average pay around HK$1,100 per year, compared to HK$7,500 for those who own private cars with internal combustion engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is proposing a five-tier fee structure based on the vehicle’s rated power, and the adjustment will be implemented in phases over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals will be discussed at the Legislative Council’s transport panel on April 25.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators from the Business and Professionals Alliance (BPA) on Wednesday urged the government to roll out support measures for Hong Kong's business sector amid the ongoing trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawmakers said authorities should help companies obtain financing from banks and keep up with their cashflow, such as by allowing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to defer loan repayments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeffrey Lam said the sector is having a hard time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some people are thinking of moving their production facilities out of Hong Kong into Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it's not easy. They need to find land or a factory space, then equip it with their machines, train people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will take months... So what's everybody going to do during this time when the factory is setting up, paying a high price for merchandise? It is not fair to the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said SMEs are the "lifeline" of Hong Kong's economy and important driving forces of economic growth in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmakers said the government should also work harder to attract foreign companies to Hong Kong, which includes setting up a fund to provide grants to leading enterprises.

 Asian stocks swung on Wednesday after Nvidia's announcement of new US licensing rules on shipments of its new chip to China rattled investor confidence already shot by Donald Trump's sweeping trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended down 1.91 percent at 21,056.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 2.55 percent to end at 7,779.01, and the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 3.72 percent to end at 4,796.28.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a relatively peaceful couple of days following last week's tariff-fuelled ructions, investors were once again on the defensive as a standoff between the world's top economic superpowers shows no signs of abating.
  <br>
  <br>
  China did little to soothe worries by saying that US levies were putting pressure on its economy, which data showed expanded more than expected in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision by Hong Kong's postal service to stop shipping US-bound goods in response to "bullying" levies added to the unease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip behemoth Nvidia said on Tuesday that US officials had told the firm it must obtain licences to ship its new H20 semiconductors to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, adding the rule would last indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move marks the latest salvo in an increasingly nasty row that has seen Washington and Beijing hit each other with eye-watering tariffs, with the technology sector and security at the heart of the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  US levies on other trading partners – despite being mostly paused – have sent global markets into a tailspin as governments scramble to cushion themselves from the impact of the measures, with many heading to Washington for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also kicked off an investigation that could see tariffs imposed on critical minerals such as rare earths that are used in a wide range of products including smartphones, wind turbines and electric vehicle motors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Silence is never golden – it's just the calm before the next chaos cycle," said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And sure enough, the tape just got rattled again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nvidia dropped the mic, revealing fresh export curbs on AI gear headed to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then came the other shoe: Trump ordering a new probe into tariffs on critical minerals. Boom – just like that, we're back in whiplash mode.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome to the new normal: one step forward, two tariff probes back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta were also down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore, Mumbai, Bangkok and Wellington rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  London fell even as UK inflation slowed more than expected in March, while Paris and Frankfurt also retreated.
  <br>
  <br>
  A weak dollar, and an ongoing run into safe havens, saw gold spike to a fresh record high of US$3,291.81. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal welfare groups on Wednesday urged the government to beef up penalties for animal cruelty and make Hong Kong a more pet-friendly city.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference at the Legislative Council, the organisations said the current penalty of HK$200,000 and a jail term of three years is not enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  They want to increase the fine to HK$1 million and extend jail terms to seven years for a stronger deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Susan Lai, founder of the Animal Rights and Welfare Association, said there are loopholes with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is an urgent need to review the current legislation, including the addition of 'due diligence' in the legislation, and also increase the penalty regarding any animal cruelty case,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Currently it is very difficult to provide evidence, and successful prosecution cases are actually very low.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite there being nearly 500 animal cruelty cases reported in the first nine months of 2024, the prosecution rate was only three percent, official figures showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  North District councillor Corey Lau said authorities should also review restrictions for pets in restaurants and expand their access to public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand is very high in Hong Kong because many pet owners want to transport and eat with their pets in the restaurants. That's why there's a demand for the improvement of the law,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau will meet officials from the Environment and Ecology Bureau to discuss these proposals later this month.

 Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said all sectors of Hong Kong society should unite and pay attention to the importance of national security, one of the three messages that he said top Beijing official Xia Baolong told Hong Kong in his keynote speech marking the National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK, Tang said people in Hong Kong, especially entrepreneurs, should prioritise national security over development, and they simply could not just focus on development and overlook national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU lawmaker said the speech by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office also emphasised the importance of remembering past events and remaining vigilant in times of peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also said Xia called for a clear recognition of the current situation and an understanding of the pressure facing China and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker pointed out that it is essential to strengthen national education for the younger generation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Wednesday that it has appointed a new trade envoy as the world's second-largest economy pushes back against US President Donald Trump's swingeing tariffs on imports that sent global markets tumbling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li Chenggang has assumed the role of representative for international trade negotiations and vice minister of commerce, Beijing's human resources ministry said in a statement on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, 58, previously served as Beijing's ambassador to the World Trade Organization and deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, according to an official biography.
  <br>
  <br>
  He boasts decades of experience in various trade ministry roles and holds law degrees from Peking University and Germany's University of Hamburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaces Wang Shouwen, the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang took part in talks that led to a 2020 trade deal between China and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Washington have been locked in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship since Trump launched a global tariff assault that has particularly targeted Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tit-for-tat retaliation has pushed US levies imposed on China to 145 percent and Beijing's toll on American goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said on Wednesday that its economy grew by 5.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, beating expectations even as officials warned that US tariffs were exerting "certain pressures". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are through to the Champions League semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing 3-1 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday with Serhou Guirassy hitting a hat-trick, the Spanish giants won through 5-3 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holding a 4-0 lead after a dominant performance in Catalonia, the visitors were made to sweat as Dortmund and Guirassy nearly pulled off a stunning turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guirassy put Dortmund in front with a Panenka from the spot with 11 minutes gone and headed them two goals clear early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dortmund sensed a sensation but Barcelona hit back, Fermin Lopez forcing Ramy Bensebaini into an own goal with just over half an hour remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guirassy re-ignited Dortmund's belief with a third on the 76th-minute mark and the final stages may have been different had Julian Brandt not been offside before scoring with 11 minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona coach Hansi Flick praised Dortmund's performance and said his side "need to focus on the positive, not the negatives".
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the team has shown in the past few weeks is incredible. We've got a lot ahead of us this season. We're a step further but we're not even close to the end," added the German.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, considered title favourites, will face either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Birmingham, PSG survived a second-half onslaught to beat Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate and reach the Champions League semi-finals, despite a 3-2 defeat on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French champions were cruising towards the last four when full-backs Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes struck in the first 27 minutes to add to their 3-1 first-leg lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Youri Tielemans pulled a goal back for the English side before half-time, and two goals in two minutes from John McGinn and Ezri Konsa transformed the tie early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG were thankful to goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma for keeping Unai Emery's men at bay and preventing another famous collapse in the Champions League knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end, we got them suffering like we did," said Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To get this level is the next step forward that I want to try to build with Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa boss Emery was in charge of PSG when Luis Enrique's Barcelona overturned a 4-0 first leg deficit with a dramatic 6-1 win in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique again emerged victorious over his compatriot but this time was the one who watched his team almost blow a seemingly unassailable lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to say that match for us is something that allows us to grow up and try to compete even better," said the PSG coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole two matches we deserved to win and we are very happy because it's the second year in a row in the semi-finals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Through to their second consecutive semi-final in the competition, PSG will face the winner of the last-eight tie between Arsenal and Real Madrid. (AFP)

 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Wednesday that an electronic regime of fixed-penalty tickets is expected to be implemented on June 15 in an attempt to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  She also said a new thematic portal and mobile application for electronic traffic enforcement will be introduced, enabling vehicle owners and drivers to verify and view tickets online and make payments for penalties via electronic means.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of digitalisation of traffic fixed penalty tickets is, in line with the direction of developing Hong Kong into a smart city, to increase the overall efficiency of traffic enforcement through the application of technology, improving the accuracy and speeding up the turnaround in the process of inputting, recording and retrieving information in relation to traffic offences or contraventions committed by offenders," she wrote in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the full implementation of the measure is estimated to save around HK$12.4 million a year as well as about HK$232 million notional savings in manpower through redeployment of staff to other traffic management duties.

    Ombudsman urges construction checks be stepped up

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan said on Wednesday the government should step up inspections to ensure the construction sector carries out safety checks thoroughly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came after the Office of the Ombudsman completed a direct investigation operation into the enforcement of government regulations on occupational safety in the construction sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  It made 40 recommendations to the Labour Department, the Buildings Department and the Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said some examiners had not carried out any inspections before certifying the safety of equipment, such as lifting appliances and bamboo scaffolds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should formulate an inspection checklist and set up an electronic platform for the sector to upload inspection records to facilitate monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We recommend the Labour Department require these examiners or certified persons to fill in a checklist… when they're checking the safety of these operations or appliances,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We propose to have a platform for these examiners to [upload] the examination records so that [they] could be easily checked by the Labour Department, and also make sure that they cannot fill in the form in advance because it's a real-time electronic platform.“
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said authorities should review the operational guidelines to select high-risk construction sites more precisely for in-depth surprise inspections.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the Buildings Department to set up a mechanism to ensure timely follow-ups on cases referred to it by the Labour Department involving contractors who had been convicted of occupational safety and health offences.

 Some locals have been left frustrated by Hongkong Post's announcement on Wednesday that it has suspended surface parcel deliveries to the United States with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move is made due to the longer shipping time required to deliver small parcels sent by surface mail in time to avoid the US tariffs that are coming into effect from May 2, given that Hongkong Post "will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US".
  <br>
  <br>
  Air delivery services will also be suspended starting from April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, postal items that only contain documents are not affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freda Cheung, who runs an online business that often requires her to send airmail parcels to the United States, said the move will greatly affect her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I will use other courier services because the tax is too high for me," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I will reject all US-bound packages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung said she will adopt a wait-and-see approach for now, adding that she might consider marketing for other countries like the ones in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, Chan, said he felt powerless, even though he only occasionally sends parcels to a friend in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the US imposing tariffs, there's nothing we can do as Hong Kong has to abide by it too," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing we can change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll still pay the tariffs. There's no other way."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man, Yeung, who sometimes sends parcel to his US relatives, said he will consider using international shipping companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he will only do so when there is an urgent need as he will have to pay more.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said that there was a good chance the United States and Britain could strike a "great agreement" on trade due to Donald Trump's love of the country and its royal family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain was spared the most punitive treatment in the US president's initial tariff announcement, due to the two sides enjoying a largely balanced trade relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Peter Anderson said the fact that trade was more balanced between the two countries would help in the UK's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His [Vance's] comments also indicated that he felt it would be easier for the US to sign a trade deal with the UK than it would be to sign one with the European countries. And he used the phrase, 'a much more reciprocal relationship with the UK.' And most people perceive that as the fact that it's quite a balanced relationship."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Anderson said the US would still push the UK to make concessions on issues such as technology and food standards, even as it held out the prospect of a trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government here in the UK is seen by the United States as having punitive taxes on tech firms. The so-called digital services tax here in the UK, which has been a problem for companies such as Amazon and Meta," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the US will be pushing for a wide range of issues, but I certainly think food standards and technical and science matters will be at the fore of that."

 Home prices rose in more Chinese cities in March from a month ago as transactions became more vibrant in the real estate market, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A survey by the bureau covering 70 major cities found the prices of new houses were higher in 24 cities last month, up from 18 in February, while resold homes in 10 cities logged price increases, up by seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home prices in first-tier cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, increased, while second and third-tier cities in general registered narrowed price declines, according to the official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a yearly basis, Chinese cities at large continued to see smaller home price drops in March, the bureau said. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has ordered a probe that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare-earth metals and associated products such as smartphones in an escalation of his dispute with global trade partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upended markets in recent weeks with his sweeping on-off levies, and this investigation could see him impose further tariffs if it shows that imports of critical minerals and their derivatives endanger US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  China dominates global supply chains for rare metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without naming any other countries, the order says that the United States is dependent on foreign sources that "are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that this dependence "raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The imports targeted include so-called critical minerals like cobalt, lithium and nickel, rare-earth elements, as well as products that partly require these resources, such as electric vehicles and batteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order states that critical minerals and their derivatives are essential for US military and energy infrastructure, noting their use in jet engines, missile guidance systems and advanced computing, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Commerce will have up to 180 days to deliver its report to Trump, the order says, adding that any recommendations for action should consider the imposition of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a similar "national security" investigation that Trump ordered on Monday into pharmaceutical imports, and another on semiconductors and chip-making equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process is based on a 1962 law that was seldom used before Trump, during his first 2017-2021 term, called on it to justify imposing taxes on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president again resorted to this law, known as Section 232, to reintroduce in mid-March tariffs of 25 percent on steel, aluminium and on automobiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year in a wide-ranging but often chaotic attempt to reorder the world economy by using levies to force manufacturers to relocate to the United States. (AFP)

    China's growth beats forecasts with 5.4pc spike

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Wednesday the economy grew a forecast-beating 5.4 percent in the first quarter as exporters rushed to get goods out of factory gates ahead of swingeing new US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Washington are locked in a fast-moving, high-stakes game of brinkmanship since US President Donald Trump launched a global tariff assault that has particularly targeted Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen US levies imposed on China rise to 145 percent and Beijing setting a retaliatory 125 percent toll on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment, the imposition of high tariffs by the US will put certain pressures on our country's foreign trade and economy," said Sheng Laiyun, Deputy Commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year last year, and the country has set a full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer demand, climbed 4.6 percent in the first quarter – rising 5.9 percent in March alone – while industrial output soared 6.5 percent, up from 5.7 percent in the final three months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the partial impact from front-loading by exporters, Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said the growth figure still indicated that the momentum has become more "organic" domestically, following a slate of policy stimulus from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at components, household appliances, furniture, communication, equipment, all those have actually grown at a double-digit pace," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we know that stimulus is working, and it's part of the reason why we have that strong retail spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if you look at sales of other items that were not supported by the government, it's still quite strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that gives us encouragement that perhaps the stimulus is not just working in the targeted segments that it wants to work, but it's also giving people the confidence to spend more on other areas as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Xu Tianchen, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit who is based in Shanghai, said: "China normally has a tendency of having a high-flying first quarter growth, and then an underwhelming second quarter, that's the pattern."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the country's growth in the second quarter might slow further, due to the additional "pains" caused by Trump's tariffs, which he said "is effectively causing an embargo on trade between the two nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "So there will be considerable pressures throughout the second and third quarters, which will then prompt government officials to offer more intervention and stimulus measures to keep the economy afloat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Xu struck a positive note, saying the economy can still hit its 5 percent growth target this year as Beijing still has a lot of fiscal "firepower" to prop up consumer spending and industrial growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it doesn't really matter whether China will hit its growth target or not as I think the key is to use the 5 percent growth target as a rallying call for the economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, China needs to let its economy not be outstripped by the US, and that would be enough," Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo expects the economy to slow to a growth rate of 4 to 4.5 percent in the coming three quarters and that the country will miss its growth target for the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the upcoming Communist Party Politburo meeting could offer clues to whether there are more measures on the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really about designing the policy stimulus so that they would have an immediate impact on the economy," Loo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the type of stimulus that would have the most immediate impact would be consumption-oriented stimulus. So we should see more of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] from a political standpoint, it might be, perhaps, more feasible to miss a growth target than to really back down on Trump's request," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think President Xi Jinping could probably look at this and think 'we missed a growth target because of our external shock, but that was highly unanticipated'. Politically, I think missing the growth target is probably not such a bad outcome as it was before."  (With contributions from AFP)

    Errant drivers to be brought to book in pilot scheme

 Police announced on Wednesday a new pilot programme to monitor traffic violations at four locations using security cameras starting on Tuesday, with the aim of enhancing road safety and enforcement efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The initiative will leverage the Transport Department’s existing traffic control and surveillance system, including CCTV systems, to detect unsafe driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fixed penalty notices will be issued to offenders once drivers are identified through captured licence plate details and timestamps of violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superintendent of traffic management at the traffic branch headquarters, Nip Hoi-kwan, said the programme expands enforcement capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, the Transport Department's traffic control and surveillance system did not have video recording capabilities," Nip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of this plan is simply to provide officers with an additional enforcement option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on traffic conditions or their experience, officers will assess when congestion is likely to be more serious, and during those times, personnel will be sent to the control centre to monitor the traffic situation and activate the recording function."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase targets Queen’s Road Central's intersections with Ice House Street, Pedder Street and Bonham Strand as well as the Queen's Road East intersection with Wong Nai Chung Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superintendent of the enforcement and control division of traffic Hong Kong Island, Mak Chung-kit, said these sites were chosen due to recurring violations and their disproportionate impact on broader traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have continuously deployed our officers, whether for patrolling, law enforcement or directing traffic, and have invested a significant amount of manpower and resources," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, traffic violations and congestion at the affected locations often reoccur shortly after our officers leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that the effectiveness of our officers' presence is very short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At these four locations, traffic violations such as illegal parking, illegal pick-ups and drop-offs or yellow box junction obstructions can cause congestion that, even in a very short period of time, will impact nearby major roads and even affect trunk roads."
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said the aim is to bolster public compliance with traffic laws, reduce accident risks and alleviate congestion through sustained monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-month pilot will undergo a review before potential expansion, with outcomes informing future enforcement strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong needs to seek new growth opportunities amid global uncertainties, such as developing e-commerce and the silver economy, says Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Yau said geopolitical challenges and supply-chain disruptions are affecting the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under these circumstances, Hong Kong must seek new ways forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many good examples, such as the chief executive leading multiple visits to the Middle East and Asean countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the SAR has traditionally relied on trade with Europe and the United States, there is a need to seek new economic partnerships to mitigate geopolitical influences, Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the mainland's impressive e-commerce transaction volumes last year, he said online shopping is one key area that Hong Kong can tap into.

  <br>
  Yau said a shopping festival held in August attracted a good response from the mainland, with 230 brands participating and more than 90 million impressions on discussion forums and the official website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also highlighted the importance of developing a silver economy, noting that around one-third of Hong Kong's population – or 2.67 million people – will be over 65 years old by 2043.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While we need to address welfare issues for elderly people from grassroots groups, there are also many middle-class or better-off seniors who own properties and have pension funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we stimulate consumption among this demographic?
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite their substantial economic power, society seems to pay little attention to their spending needs," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government working group on the silver economy is focused on five areas: boosting consumption, developing the industry, promoting quality assurance, enhancing financial security and unleashing productivity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An iconic Hollywood studio lot and the golden sands of Venice Beach are among an array of Los Angeles landmarks that will stage events for the 2028 Olympic Games, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an updated list of venues for the Games, LA28 confirmed on Tuesday venues for surfing, triathlon, baseball, cricket and squash among other sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios will play host to squash's Olympic debut, with the sport taking place on Courthouse Square – the mock-up town square featured prominently in Oscar-winning movies such as "Back to the Future" and "To Kill a Mockingbird".
  <br>
  <br>
  Venice Beach meanwhile will host the triathlon – relocating from its initial venue in Long Beach – and will also be the starting point for the men's and women's marathon, as well as the cycling road races.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also confirmed that cricket – which is making its return to the Olympics for the first time in more than a century – will be held at a purpose-built venue at Pomona, just east of Los Angeles. Earlier reports had suggested cricket could have been staged thousands of miles from Los Angeles in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue for surfing was also confirmed, with the competition taking place at Trestles Beach in the coastal town of San Clemente, roughly 98 kilometres from Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trestles is widely considered to be one of the best surfing locations in California, known for consistent waves and a classic point break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baseball will take place at Dodger Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, which also hosted the sport at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've promised the world an incredible Olympic Games and today we're proud to share the plan that will make it happen," LA28 chief executive Reynold Hoover said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2028 Olympic venue plan invites communities from across the region to celebrate the Games coming to their backyard with the most exciting sports staged at some of the world's top-tier existing stadiums and arenas, famous beaches and purpose-built temporary structures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said the venue plan announced on Tuesday would "bring the Games to all corners of our city like never before".
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the Sepulveda Basin to the iconic shores of Venice Beach, our world-famous neighbourhoods as well as our hidden gems will be on full display for all to experience and enjoy," Bass said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other event venues announced include horse racing's Santa Anita Park, which will host the equestrian events and Anaheim's Honda Center, which will host volleyball. (AFP)

    Biden slams Trump 'destruction' in speech

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden, in his first major speech since leaving the White House, railed on Tuesday against his successor US President Donald Trump's frenetic government overhaul, claiming the "hatchet" effort put Americans' retirement benefits at risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Fewer than 100 days, this administration has done so much damage, and so much destruction - it's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon," the former US president told a conference of disability advocates in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees out the door," said Biden, referring to the national agency which pays out retirement and disability benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wearing a blue suit and tie, and standing in front of American flags, the 82-year-old Democrat spoke for around a half-hour, displaying at times the signs of ageing that prompted him to abandon his re-election campaign last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stumbled over some sentences as he read from a teleprompter and struggled to get through winding off-the-cuff anecdotes, cutting himself off with a favourite phrase, "anyways."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in a jab at Biden, posted a short video on social media of one of the rambling anecdotes, without comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's choice of topic, social security, aimed to ramp up pressure on Trump over his rampaging government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted staff reductions at the agency that Trump and his billionaire aide Elon Musk have pushed as part of their Department of Government Efficiency, saying the social security "website is crashing" and hindering retirees from getting their benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which more than 65 million Americans rely on, is colloquially known in Washington as the "third rail of politics" for its sensitivity to voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Americans "literally count on social security to buy food, just to get by," Biden said, and "many of these beneficiaries, it's their only income. If it were cut or taken away, it would be devastating, devastating for millions of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  He bashed Trump's commerce secretary, former hedge fund manager Howard Lutnick, over a recent remark in which he said "fraudsters" would complain about a missing cheque, but not his mother-in-law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden scoffed at that characterisation, saying "what about the 94-year-old mother living all by herself - who doesn't have a billionaire in the family?" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's junior men’s epee team made history at the World Cadets and Juniors Fencing Championships in Wuxi, clinching their first-ever bronze medal in the event - a landmark achievement for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quartet of Gao Ying-chuen, Kenton Hsu, Wong Chi-ho, and Yuen Nok-man stormed through the early rounds, overcoming the Netherlands, Germany and Ukraine in succession to secure a spot in the semifinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although they were stopped by Canada in their quest for gold, the team regrouped for a dramatic bronze-medal showdown against Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tense finale, Hong Kong narrowly edged out their rivals 45-43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trailing 23-25 at halftime, Yuen turned the tide with a gritty 3-1 rally in the sixth round to level the score at 26-26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong then ignited a commanding 9-3 surge, propelling Hong Kong to a 35-29 lead and cementing their path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy claimed gold in the event, with Canada securing silver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men’s team bronze, combined with Wu Haidi’s earlier third-place finish in the women’s cadet individual epee, capped Hong Kong’s campaign with two medals - a record haul for the SAR at the championships.

 Hongkong Post announced on Wednesday an immediate suspension of parcel services to the United States via surface mail, due to the longer shipping time as small parcels are due to be hit by US tariffs from May 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said it would contact the senders of such mail to make return and refund arrangements from April 22 if their parcels had not yet been shipped to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  For air parcels, services will stop from April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively. Hongkong Post will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US and will suspend the acceptance of postal items containing goods destined to the US," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other postal items containing documents only without goods will not be affected.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Worldwide consumption of wine fell in 2024 to its lowest level in more than 60 years, the main trade body said on Tuesday, raising concerns about new risks from US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said that 2024 sales fell 3.3 percent from the previous year to 214.2 million hectolitres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV, whose report was based on government figures, said this would be the lowest sales figure since 1961, when sales were 213.6 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production is also at its lowest level in more than 60 years, having fallen 4.8 percent in 2024 to 225.8 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  OIV statistics chief Giorgio Delgrosso said the wine industry had been hit by a perfect storm with health concerns driving down consumption in many countries while economic factors had added to troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beyond the short-term economic and geopolitical disruptions," said the IOV's annual report, "it is important to consider the structural, long-term factors also contributing to the observed decline in wine consumption."
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV said that the consumer is now paying about 30 percent more for a bottle now than in 2019-2020 and overall consumption has fallen by 12 percent since then.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, the world's top wine market, saw consumption fall 5.8 percent to 33.3 million hl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delgrosso said that tariffs ordered by US President Donald Trump, even though temporarily suspended, could become "another bomb" for the wine industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales in China remain below pre-Covid-19 levels, despite a rebound since the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe, which accounts for nearly half of worldwide sales, saw consumption fall 2.8 percent last year. Even in France, one of the key global producers, 3.6 percent less wine was knocked back last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain and Portugal were among rare markets where consumption increased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIV said production had been hit environmental extremes such as above average rainfall in some key regions and droughts in others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy was the world's top producer with 44 million hl, while France's output fell 23 percent to 36.1 million hl, its lowest level since 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is also the biggest wine exporter and its trade increased because of the popularity of sparkling wines such as Prosecco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain produced 31 million hl, while US wine output fell 17.2 percent to 21.1 million hl, mainly because of extreme heat. (AFP)

<img alt="The US has already restricted exports to China of Nvidia's most sophisticated GPUs. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800550_1_20250416073248.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia on Tuesday notified regulators that it expects a US$5.5 billion hit this quarter due to a new US licensing requirement on the primary chip it can legally sell in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials last week told Nvidia it must obtain licences to export its H20 chips to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, the Silicon Valley company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia, which have seen high volatility since US President Donald Trump made a major tariffs announcement on April 2, were down more than six percent in after-market trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new licensing rule applies to Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) with bandwidth similar to that of the H20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had already restricted exports to China of Nvidia's most sophisticated GPUs, tailored for powering top-end artificial intelligence models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia was told the licensing requirement on H20 chips would last indefinitely, it said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia's current fiscal quarter ends on April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately US$5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves," Nvidia said in the filing.

  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said publicly that the AI chip powerhouse will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump, and that nothing will stop the global advancement of artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to do that and we'll be able to do that just fine," the entrepreneur told reporters last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's predecessor Joe Biden restricted Nvidia from selling some of its top AI chips to China, which the United States sees as a competitor in technology.

  Global markets have been on a roller coaster since Trump's April 2 announcement, declining sharply before partially recovering with his 90-day pause on the steepest tariff rates last week. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump believes it is up to China, not the United States, to come to the negotiating table on trade, the White House said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them," said a statement from Trump read out by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year, but has reserved his heaviest blows for China - imposing additional 145 percent levies on many Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing again on Tuesday, saying on Truth Social that China did not fulfil its commitments under an earlier trade deal. He appeared to be referencing a pact that marked a truce in both sides' escalating tariff war during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said China bought only "a portion of what they agreed to buy," charging that Beijing had "zero respect" for his predecessor Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt maintained that Trump remained open to a deal with Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed, however, that it was China that needed to step forward first, pointing to the strength of the US consumer market as leverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the year, Trump has imposed steep duties on imports from China, alongside a 10 percent "baseline" tariff on many US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration recently widened exemptions from these tariffs, excluding certain tech products like smartphones and laptops from the global 10 percent tariff and latest 125 percent levy on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Chinese imports still face the total 145 percent additional tariff, or at least an earlier 20 percent levy that Trump rolled out over China's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing has introduced counter-tariffs targeting US agricultural goods, and it later retaliated with a sweeping 125 percent levy of its own on imported US products.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the US tariffs, calling them unilateral and protectionist. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang called on the country's exporters on Tuesday to diversify their markets to cope with external changes, and vowed to support more domestic consumption, in comments on mainland media.
 <br>
  <br>
  China has been hit with the highest tariffs in US President Donald Trump's moves to impose hefty duties on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump hiked duties on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on US goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, profound changes in the external environment have adversely affected China's foreign trade and exports," a radio broadcast cited Li as saying in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should calmly respond to the difficulties and challenges brought by external shocks, promote consumption and expand domestic demand with greater efforts," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese companies should actively explore diversified markets, innovate trade channels and methods, and strive to stabilise foreign trade, Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will help high-quality foreign trade products expand into the domestic market and steadily promote the integrated development of domestic and foreign trade, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest US tariffs took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pledged to take steps to stabilise employment, promote income growth, and strengthen social safety nets to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is still significant room for development in China’s real estate market and efforts should be made to further unlock market potential, Li said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday following news of solid bank earnings as investors monitor developments in the US-China trade war after last week's market gyrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's quiet," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "Right now, you have a situation of digestion or the market consolidating a lot of volatility over the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished 0.4 percent lower at 40,368.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,396 while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,823.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors welcomed a calmer US Treasury market after last week's spike in US Treasury bond yields. But there is still a lot of uncertainty among market participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Will we have relief or progress with the trade tariff situation or is the situation going to get worse?" Sarhan said. "We don't know. That question mark is leading investors to hold off from taking any big positions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of America rose 3.6 percent, while Citigroup gained 1.8 percent as large lenders concluded a solid round of first-quarter earnings results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netflix surged 4.8 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that said the streaming company is targeting a doubling of revenue by 2030. (AFP)

<img alt="Hamas said on Monday it had received a new truce offer from Israel that foresees the release of 10 living hostages, starting with soldier Edan Alexander.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said on Tuesday that after an Israeli airstrike it had "lost contact" with the captors of an Israeli-American hostage in Gaza, whose release takes centre stage in Israel's latest proposal for a renewed ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited northern Gaza on Tuesday, his office announced, as the military kept up the offensive it resumed on March 18, effectively ending a two-month ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We announce that we have lost contact with the group holding soldier Edan Alexander following a direct strike on their location. We are still trying to reach them at this moment," Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's military wing the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said on his Telegram channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military wing later released a video addressed to the families of the remaining hostages, warning them that their loved ones were likely to return in coffins if Israel keeps up its bombardment of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over video images of masked militants carrying black coffins out of white vans in the darkness, the video carried a subtitled message in English, Arabic and Hebrew.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Be prepared. Soon, your children will return in black coffins with their bodies torn apart by shrapnel from your army's missiles," the message warns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing released a video on Saturday showing Alexander alive, in which he criticised the Israeli government for failing to secure his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander appeared to be speaking under duress in the footage, making frequent hand gestures as he criticised Netanyahu's government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear when the video was filmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the Gaza border when he was abducted by Palestinian militants during their October 2023 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldier, who turned 21 in captivity, was born in Tel Aviv and grew up in the US state of New Jersey, returning to Israel after high school to join the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said on Monday it had received a new truce offer from Israel that foresees the release of 10 living hostages, starting with Alexander, in exchange for a 45-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hamas official said the Israeli proposal called for Alexander's release on the first day of the ceasefire as a "gesture of goodwill."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was delivered to the group's delegation in Cairo by Egyptian officials over the weekend and a senior Hamas official said the group would "most likely" respond within 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Out of 251 hostages taken during Hamas's October 2023 attack, a total of 58 remain in captivity, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

<img alt="Justice minister Gerald Darmanin says the attacks remind him of those carried out by gangsters to intimidate their rivals. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800530_1_20250416015453.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's justice minister on Tuesday said gun and arson attacks on at least six prisons around the country were acts of terrorism directed at security officials charged with guarding some of the nation's most hardened crime kingpins.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visiting Toulon prison in southern France, whose entrance was shot at with an AK-47 automatic rifle, Gerald Darmanin said he could not be sure if the attacks were linked to government efforts to clamp down on France's fast-growing drug trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said authorities were making life much harder for imprisoned gangsters, and the government would not shy away from tackling drug crime, which has boosted support for the far right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Republic will not back down," he told reporters. "These are extremely serious crimes ... an attack on the public prison service, that is, a terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of record South American cocaine imports to Europe have transformed local drug markets, sparking a wave of violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite record cocaine seizures in France, gangs are reaping windfalls as they expand from traditional power bases in cities such as Marseille into smaller towns unused to drug violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin, who plans to create new high-security prisons to crack down on gangsters who run their empires from behind bars, said at least six prisons had been targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prison officers' union UFAP said vehicles were set on fire outside jails in Villepinte, Nanterre, Aix-Luynes, and Valence. In Nancy, a prison officer was threatened at home, while in Marseille, there was an attempted arson attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had taken charge of the probe into the attacks, which also targeted the National School of Prison Administration. The PNAT said officers from France's domestic intelligence agency DGSI would assist in the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said it was unusual for PNAT, rather than specialised organised crime prosecutors, to take charge of the investigation, but it was justified due to the national scale of attacks against symbols of the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letters "DDPF" – apparently an acronym for "French prisoners' rights" – were tagged on many of the attack sites, and police sources suggested it could be the work of a far-left militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said there had been "DDPF" groups on Telegram and Signal that had encouraged attacks against prisons, but "there hasn't been any claim of responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know who's behind this slogan, and I don't care because what I remember is not that a prison door was tagged, but that it was shot at by a Kalashnikov," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darmanin said the prison attacks reminded him of contracts given to gangsters to threaten, assault or kill rivals. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle manager Eddie Howe will only return to lead the club when he is "100 percent" ready following a diagnosis of pneumonia, his assistant Jason Tindall said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The League Cup winners, who are chasing a Champions League spot, issued a statement on Monday saying the 47-year-old, who was admitted to hospital on Friday, was recovering and would miss Premier League games against Crystal Palace and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe, who sent his congratulations to the team after Sunday's impressive 4-1 win over Manchester United moved them back into the top four, offered thanks for the messages of support he has received in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tindall, speaking to reporters on the eve of Newcastle's home match against Palace, said: "We've had minimal dialogue together since that announcement. He's in the best possible hands and he'll be back as soon as he feels he's ready to come back 100 percent to lead the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  No timeframe has been established for Howe's return and, with the Magpies sitting a point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, Tindall could find himself at the helm for the defining period of the Premier League season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what role Howe might play, he said: "For the manager not to be here, he's obviously poorly in hospital and the same as last week, we had minimal contact in terms of preparations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we know the expectations and demands that we put on each other and ourselves each and every day, and it's going to have to remain that way until the manager is back."
  <br>
  <br>
  In-form Newcastle, who have seven league games to play, will move above Forest into third place if they avoid defeat against Palace at St James' Park on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top five teams in the Premier League will all qualify for the Champions League next season. (AFP)

 Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday he was satisfied with talks with arch-foe the United States but warned they could ultimately prove fruitless.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tehran and Washington are due to meet again in Muscat on Saturday, a week after top officials held the highest-level talks since the landmark 2015 nuclear accord collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who pulled out of the deal during his first term, revived his "maximum pressure" sanctions campaign after returning to office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March, he sent a letter to Khamenei urging talks and warning of possible military action if Iran refused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks were "well carried out in the first steps", Khamenei said, quoted by state television. "Of course, we are very pessimistic about the other side, but we are optimistic about our own capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that "the negotiations may or may not yield results."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having no diplomatic ties since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, both sides described the talks as "constructive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran insists discussions remain "indirect" and mediated by Oman.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Trump again threatened to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if no deal was reached, calling Iranian authorities "radicals" who should not possess nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran denies seeking an atomic bomb, saying its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, especially energy production. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the Greater Bay Area (GBA) offers a key development opportunity for local tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the comments in a speech at the 2025 World Tourism Cities Federation Hong Kong Fragrant Hills Tourism Summit held in the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE pointed out that the GBA has a population of over 86 million and a combined GDP rivalling that of the world's 10th largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What it means is a consumer market and source of tourists that is over 10 times as large as our own city. What it also means, with our country’s facilitation measures for travellers, is that visitors who choose to visit this part of the world have much more cities to add to their itinerary," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are fast developing in multi-destination tourism for an interconnected world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the SAR is dedicated to free and open trade, despite global trade tensions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday began a state visit to Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br>
  He expressed hope that his trip will yield fruitful outcomes, ushering in a new "Golden 50 Years" of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi was greeted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim when he arrived in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written statement upon his arrival, the president said he expects the visit to open a new historic chapter of good-neighbourly friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a signed article titled "May the Ship of China-Malaysia Friendship Sail Toward an Even Brighter Future" published in local media ahead of his arrival, Xi said he looks forward to meeting with Malaysian friends to celebrate the friendship between the two countries and plan for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged Beijing and Kuala Lumpur to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and strengthen cooperation on industrial and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides must uphold the multilateral trading system, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and maintain an international environment of openness and cooperation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that China will work with Malaysia and other  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states to combat unilateralism and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his stay in Malaysia, Xi is expected to discuss a free trade agreement between China and Asean, with Malaysia being the chair of the association this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll meet with King Sultan Ibrahim on Wednesday morning and Anwar later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn said the agreement will eliminate many tariffs between China and the bloc's members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will bring more tariffs down to zero in many cases, and then expand to all the areas,” he said in an interview with CGTN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is on a three-nation overseas trip. He earlier visited Vietnam during which Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will later visit Cambodia on the final leg of his trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<img alt="John Hoffman says Hong Kong should make use of its proximity to the mainland to learn from the largest mobile network operators there.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An association representing global mobile operators said on Tuesday Hong Kong is a pivotal region for the development of innovation and technology and that it can learn from the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) said operators on the mainland and in Hong Kong are leaders in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the Asia-Pacific Summit of the World Internet Conference, association chief executive and director John Hoffman said Hong Kong should make use of its development centres and talent to further promote AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The companies] are leading in many aspects of not only the development of AI through companies like DeepSeek and others that are pushing the boundaries of AI, but then to turn around and implement them in a way that it benefits society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not technology for technology's sake, but it's technology for the betterment of industry, businesses, government and of course society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman said the mainland has some of the largest mobile operators in the world and Hong Kong should make use of its proximity to the mainland to learn from the firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Hong Kong has proven in the past that it's a place of export," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a place where others can learn from... Hong Kong must seize that opportunity to learn from the mainland, then adapt and modify to its local conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully the rest of the world can look to Hong Kong and say 'This is a great solution. Let me try something similar'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Digital Policy Office on Tuesday released guidelines on the application of generative AI, aiming to facilitate the safe and responsible use of AI by the industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoffman said guidelines on the use of AI must be localised but stressed that they should be established under a framework that allows innovation to further develop.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An updated mandatory national standard on the safety of electric vehicle batteries in China is set to take effect on July 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The standard is laid out in "Safety Requirements for Power Batteries Used in Electric Vehicles (GB38031-2025)," according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revisions include updates to thermal diffusion testing of batteries, further clarifying temperature requirements, observation time and vehicle testing conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new bottom impact test has been introduced to assess the protective capabilities for the battery from impacts to its base.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new safety test following fast charging cycles has also been added, which requires external short circuit testing after 300 fast-charging cycles, mandating no fire or explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised version clearly states that the standard applies to power batteries for electric vehicles, excluding non-propulsion batteries. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 137th edition of the China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, kicked off on Tuesday, with the number of export exhibitors exceeding 30,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's edition of the fair, which ends on May 5, has attracted around 31,000 participating firms, up by nearly 900 over last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200,000 overseas buyers from 215 countries and regions have preregistered, with the lineup featuring the likes of retail giants Walmart and Target from the United States, Carrefour from France, Tesco and Kingfisher from Britain, and Germany's Metro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair is divided into three phases: advanced manufacturing, home furnishings and products that promote a better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will involve 172 product zones, including, for the first time, a special zone for service robots focused on showcasing the latest achievements of China's AI development efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Canton Fair is held in the year when China's '14th Five-Year Plan' nears completion – which is of great significance in promoting the innovative development of trade, thus ensuring stable foreign trade volume and improving foreign trade quality," said Zhang Sihong, deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the large gathering of global buyers at the fair underlined the trust of the international business community in made-in-China products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair has always been an important driver of global trade, said Andre Rocha, president of the Federation of Industries of the State of Goias, Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here, people can learn about the major global development trends and cutting-edge technologies, as well as solutions that can actually boost industrial development, he added. (Xinhua)

    HK 'must step up vigilance over soft confrontations'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland and SAR scholars on Tuesday called on the Hong Kong government to ramp up its vigilance against the so-called "soft confrontations", saying external powers such as the United States could double down on its suppression efforts against China via "ideological wars".
 <br>
  <br>
  Such comments came as the city marks the 10th National Security Education Day, with a forum held in the afternoon featuring the subject of soft confrontations, or "soft resistance", which refers to forces that focused on ideological warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the forum, Huang Dahui, a School of International Studies professor at Renmin University of China, noted that soft confrontation has emerged as a new battlefield and strategy among major powers and warned that Hong Kong is susceptible to such ideological warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all know that Hong Kong is a diverse, open and highly interconnected society," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And therefore Hong Kong's interests, social composition and ideologies are also very diverse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With such features, Hong Kong is more susceptible to this kind of soft confrontation cognitive warfare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And soft confrontations are more likely to work here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor, also the chief expert in the National Security Interdisciplinary Platform, further elaborated that such soft confrontations often come in the form of "spreading fake information" to confuse the public and represent a cognitive theory of western nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the SAR government to adopt more technologies to further improve its monitoring and warning systems to guard against such "psychological warfare", while ramping up its regulations to minimise risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said at the same event that soft confrontations have become even more effective following the rapid development of social media, making them potentially even more powerful than military, diplomatic and espionage measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senior member of the leading national think tank warned that he believes external forces, including the United States, will double down by using soft confrontations to suppress the mainland and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since conducting 'hard confrontations' is very difficult at present, soft confrontations have become an important means of political struggle," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expect the United States will increase its efforts to suppress and smear China's rise and Hong Kong's development in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expect external forces will continue to launch propaganda wars against Hong Kong, intending to cause divisions and struggles in Hong Kong in order to undermine its international image."

 President Xi Jinping has described his state visit to Vietnam as "fruitful albeit brief" as he wrapped up his two-day trip on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi urged China and Vietnam to jointly oppose power politics and unilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart Luong Cuong, Xi said trade wars will undermine the international trading system, stability of the global economic order and legitimate interests of all countries in the world, especially developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added he has full confidence in the future of bilateral relations when he bid farewell to Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, artificial intelligence, joint maritime patrols and railway development, during the president's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to one of the cooperation documents, the two sides agreed that China will carry out feasibility studies for two planned rail links.
  <br>
  <br>
  One connects southern Guangxi region to the Vietnamese capital Hanoi; the other involves a new line linking Shenzhen and Haiphong.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump complained about the visit, saying it was aimed at hurting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi next heads to Malaysia on the second leg of his three-nation tour, which will also take him to Cambodia. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Equities mostly rose on Tuesday as some stability returned to markets after last week's rollercoaster ride, with auto firms boosted by US President Donald Trump's possible compromise over steep tariffs on the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index edged up 0.23 percent to close at 21,466.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.21 percent to end at 7,982.88 while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 0.67 percent to end at 4,981.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Trump's unorthodox approach to trade diplomacy continues to fuel uncertainty among investors, with speculation over new levies on high-end technology and pharmaceuticals dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement last week of exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronics – all key Chinese-made products – provided a little comfort, though Trump's suggestion they would be temporary tempered the optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders gave a muted reaction to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks on Monday that a China-US deal could be done in an apparent olive branch as the two economic powerhouses trade tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as Trump has hammered China with duties of up to 145 percent, while Beijing has imposed retaliatory measures of 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a big deal to be done at some point", Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV about the possibility that the world's largest economies would decouple.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There doesn't have to be" decoupling, he said, "but there could be".
  <br>
  <br>
  After a broadly positive day on Wall Street, other Asian markets also pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, Mumbai, Manila and Jakarta all rallied, with London and Frankfurt also climbing but Paris edged down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were boosted by a rally in autos after Trump said he was "very flexible" and "looking at something to help some of the car companies" hit by his 25 percent tariff on all imports. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Singaporeans vote on May 3 in an election that will test Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership, as the wealthy city-state faces a turbulent global economy upended by US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  This will be the first electoral battle for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) under Wong since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, last year after decades of leadership by the Lees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament was dissolved on Tuesday, clearing the way for the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore has long been dominated by the PAP, which is expected to remain in power, but opposition gains are closely watched as a referendum on the government's popularity.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the upcoming elections come at a precarious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The global trading system that supported tiny, trade-reliant Singapore's rapid ascent to prosperity is under severe strain since US President Donald Trump's return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore, one of the world's biggest transhipment hubs, finds itself exposed after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, disrupting global supply chains and sparking fears of a full-blown trade war with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Singapore's trade ministry downgraded its economic growth forecast for 2025 to between zero and 2 percent from 1 to 3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a stark warning to parliament last week, Premier Wong declared that the "era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We risk being squeezed out, marginalised and left behind," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, 52, is seeking a firm mandate to steer the country through choppy waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will "strengthen his hand and that of his government in putting in place policies and measures to protect the economy and to negotiate with other countries", said Eugene Tan, associate professor of law at the Singapore Management University.
  <br>
  <br>
  PAP is one of the world's longest-running political parties having been in power since 1959.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the party's dominance is increasingly being challenged by a more vocal electorate, especially among younger voters who appear open to alternative political voices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming elections "may well be the toughest electoral battle for the ruling party", said Mustafa Izzuddin, a political analyst with Solaris Strategies Singapore, citing the "unpredictability of ground sentiments and the emergence of a better quality opposition".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan of SMU said "millennial and Gen-Z voters are much more receptive... to a credible opposition in parliament".
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the opposition Workers' Party (WP) made historic gains, winning 10 of the 93 seats at stake – a significant jump from its previously held four seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hoping to build on that momentum and is expected to field candidates like Harvard-trained senior counsel Harpreet Singh, 59.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 97 seats are up for grabs in this election – four more than in 2020 – following a redrawing of electoral boundaries. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese engineers began on Tuesday a difficult operation to remove a second sample of radioactive debris from inside the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 880 tonnes of hazardous material are inside the site after a catastrophic tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of history's worst nuclear accidents in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Removing the debris is seen as the most daunting challenge in a decades-long decommissioning project because of the dangerously high radiation levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 10.03am [9.03am Hong Kong time], the second trial extraction operation was started," Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second removal comes after Tepco completed the first trial removal operation using a specially developed extendible device in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sample weighing just below 0.7 grams – equivalent to about one raisin – was delivered to a research lab near Tokyo for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tepco needs more data to examine methods for full-scale debris extractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said in December it was "upgrading" the telescopic device used for the first experiment by attaching a new camera to its tip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, robots began moving sandbags that were used to absorb radiation-contaminated water on underground floors of two buildings at the Fukushima site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Japan began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of treated wastewater in a move that has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  China banned Japanese seafood imports as a result, and Russia later followed suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  This month China said it found no abnormalities in seawater and marine life samples that it independently collected near Fukushima in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Beijing indicated that more tests would be needed before it lifts the ban. (AFP)

<img alt="Computer monitors that contain chips such as these made-in-China models being sold at a store in Washington, DC, may come under the US investigations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trump administration has taken its next steps towards imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip-making equipment and pharmaceuticals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late on Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although US President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them – which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items – affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs to for the sake of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe includes assessing the potential for US domestic production of computer chips to meet US demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on US competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, “foreign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls “reciprocal tariffs" of up to 50 percent on some nations, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with “sector specific” tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And those are not available for negotiation,” Lutnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make medicine in this country. We need to make semiconductors.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said on Monday, “Yeah, we're going to be doing that.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be in the “not too distant future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92 percent of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat said on Tuesday free trade and globalisation are losing momentum in the face of a wave of US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan was delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of an e-commerce conference in Tsim Sha Tsui co-hosted by the Customs and Excise Department and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Secretariat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said global tariffs imposed by the United States had brought significant challenges and uncertainty to international trade but that Hong Kong would support free trade by sticking to its zero-tariffs regime on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The customs chief urged trade partners in the Asia-Pacific region to work together to protect multilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In these challenging times, we call on our Asia-Pacific partners to stand united, promote multilateral collaboration and strengthen trust between the public and private sectors,” Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must work together to develop innovative and forward-looking solutions that cater for the benefits of all members and stakeholders in the supply chain, ensuring that e-commerce continues to contribute to global prosperity in a safe, secure and efficient manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the opening ceremony, Chan said the tariffs are not affecting Customs’ works at border control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Cuong Ba Tran, the assistant director and head of the Asean Secretariat’s trade facilitation division, said experts from the World Customs Organization and e-commerce giants such as DHL and Alibaba have joined the three-day conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the conference provides good opportunities for Asean countries to gain expertise and experiences from Hong Kong Customs and experts on e-commerce.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should push for greater development and contribute more to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Zheng pointed out that the office will fully implement the central government's request to fully support the chief executive and SAR government to turn Beijing's hopes into concrete actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said Hong Kong should firmly coordinate high-quality development and a high level of security to achieve a positive interaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that if security cannot be maintained, development will not be solid.
  <br>
  <br>
  If development is delayed and neglected, the basis of security will not be firm, Zheng said, adding that Hong Kong has to maintain its positive momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said that the SAR should contribute more to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new phase of Hong Kong has both traditional strengths, as well as new advantages, such as AI, research and development, innovation and technology, talent hub and coordinated development with the Greater Bay Area, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It even has unique strengths such as institutional innovation and acting as a gateway between the mainland and the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The liaison office director also stressed that safeguarding national security needs continuous effort.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumers should read through seasonal performance factor indicators for split-level air conditioners and not just their energy-efficiency labels before making a purchase, the Consumer Council said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came after the watchdog tested 12 two-horsepower models priced between HK$9,888 and HK$20,580, with seven of them being cooling-only models and the other five also having heating capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  All models were rated Grade 1 under the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department’s (EMSD) energy-efficiency labeling scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council found that two of the cooling-only models and two of the cooling and heating models provided less capacity than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even after checking to make sure [the appliance] is of Grade 1, what you can do is to refer to the CSPF (cooling energy efficiency) and also the HSPF (heating energy efficiency) factors," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our findings this time, the maximum difference can be about 27 percent and 10 percent respectively, for cooling and also heating.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By looking at these factors, you can identify a product that can offer you the best energy-efficiency performance,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the current electricity cost of HK$1.70 per kWh, consumers can save around HK$400 a year by using cooling models that are more energy efficient if they are turned on for 12 hours daily for 180 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  For heating functions, the savings only amount to only HK$17, but that's based on the assumption the machine is in use for 12 hours daily for just 25 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  As such, the council suggested the EMSD upgrade its energy label grading standards to help consumers save on energy use and encourage suppliers to provide more energy-efficient products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged sellers to extend product coverage, after finding seven models only provided one-year full warranties and that one model offered no warranty renewal options.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consumer watchdog said consumers are required to pay maintenance costs for the machines after the period, such as on-site inspections and scaffolding.

    HK to grasp opportunities arising from tariff war: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong will grasp the opportunities brought by a new economic and trade order amid the tariff war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Lee slammed the United States for being "ridiculous" and "making wrong calculations" after the country imposed a total of 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted Hong Kong does not levy tariffs on imports and exports, and that the moves by the US are damaging the multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR should be fully prepared for challenges, and make good use of its strengths as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has changed the world's economic and trade order. A new order will be formed. In the process, there are both risks and opportunities for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are looking into possible opportunities that can be generated by the new order. Hong Kong is a free port with zero tariffs, and this can attract more trade and business activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong will explore new markets and deepen regional cooperation, such as with Asean, the Middle East and Belt and Road countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability has been restored in Hong Kong after the national security law took effect five years ago, but the city should be prepared for turbulent and stormy times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must always remember that the aftermath of the 2019 black-clad violence has not come to an end. There are still attempts at the resurgence of anti-China and anti-Hong Kong forces, with acts of soft resistance, and inciting disgust and hatred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the government will use new methods to promote national security education, such as making use of different media platforms and technologies.

    Xia Baolong: United States after our very survival

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing SAR affairs on Tuesday slammed the United States for imposing heavy tariffs on Hong Kong, calling the move "extremely arrogant and shameless".
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said in a video address that the up to 145 percent US tariffs on SAR goods showed "the US isn't after our tariffs – it is after our very survival".
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Xia said the US levies were particularly unreasonable given the SAR is a free port with no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This makes it clearer to the world that the US cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and it is the biggest 'sinister manipulator' undermining human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said the US has continued its suppression and containment of the SAR time and time again, adding that these actions will ultimately backfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let those American peasants wail before the 5,000-year-old civilisation of the Chinese nation! History and reality tell us that the Chinese people will never accept bullying and all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, cannot be intimidated or overwhelmed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese have a proverb – strike a punch to avoid a hundred punches... Whether it is a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, we have nothing to fear. The sky will not fall," Xia added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also criticised the US for sanctioning six mainland and Hong Kong officials, accusing it of fabricating the so-called 2025 Hong Kong Policy Act Report, "once again exposing US' bullying and hegemonic true colours and its ugly face of hysteria born of desperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  And while Hong Kong appears calm on the surface, Xia warned of underlying security concerns and stressed that the struggle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong have not yet been eliminated... Many people still have confused ideas, some sympathise with those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong, some justify them, and some admire, fear, worship or fantasise about the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence in Hong Kong's business sector despite US pressure on China, saying that enterprises will continue to thrive with the city's unique advantages and strong backing from the nation.

<img alt="The Trump administration has been moving quickly to deport migrants such as this group of Venezuelans back to their countries of origin or any place that accepts them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal judge has blocked US President Donald Trump's administration from quickly revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Haiti.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ruling by District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston on Monday is the latest order against Trump's rapid push to carry out mass deportations, particularly targeting Latin Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March, the administration said it was moving to revoke the legal status of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the United States under a "parole" programme initially launched by former president Joe Biden in October 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court grants emergency relief staying the Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans," Talwani wrote in her order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parole programme allowed entry to the US for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her order, Talwani said the Trump administration had acted on a flawed interpretation of immigration law, with expedited removal applicable to non-citizens entering the US illegally, but not those authorised to be in the country, such as through the parole programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Trump's revocation, the immigrants would have lost their legal protection effective April 24, just 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security published its order in the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to deport "millions" of undocumented migrants in his second term, after running an election campaign that focused on illegal immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other measures, he has invoked rare wartime legislation to fly hundreds of alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which is imprisoning the migrants. (AFP)

<img alt="Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs says the US could face an uphill battle in its trade dispute with China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800419_1_20250415112206.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Renowned American economist, Jeffrey Sachs, on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump would not win the trade war against China, as Beijing is no longer as dependent on US markets as it was in the past.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the world's two largest economies remain in a stand-off over sweeping tariffs that Washington imposed this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Sachs, who teaches economics at Columbia University, said it was a "mistake" for the United States to launch the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no doubt it started on the US side. The US actions violate international rules, and they violate economic sense. They will create costs, both for the US, for China, and for the rest of the world. But the biggest costs will be borne by the United States, especially US consumers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US consumers will face higher prices and lower living standards, that's why they're pessimistic. Some consumers are already cutting back on their consumption knowing that they're going to suffer a decline of living standards in future months, even with the risk of a recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] I think that the [consumer] costs in China will be much lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's shipments to the US amounted to around US$440 billion last year, Sachs said that accounted for only a small share of the country's total US$3.68 trillion worth of exports in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The truth is, the United States is not going to win this trade war, as China is just not as dependent on the US market as Donald Trump seems to think."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sachs, who is also the director of Columbia’s Centre for Sustainable Development, noted the global trading system would remain open despite the sweeping tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The open trading system will continue, but the United States might not be part of it, and this will be at a big cost to the United States, a big economic cost, a big development cost, and a big geopolitical cost."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 300 primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens, involving nearly 160,000 students across Hong Kong, held flag-raising ceremonies to mark National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Association of Hong Kong Flag-guards, officials from the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau and the police attended the event’s main flag-raising ceremony at the Hennessy Road Government Primary School (Causeway Bay).
  <br>
  <br>
  A pupil surnamed Wong, who is part of the flag-raising team there, said representing her school in the ceremony filled her with pride.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason I joined the flag-raising team was to try something new and to see how the team actually operates. After two years of training, I truly feel that being part of the flag-raising team is very worthwhile because I get to be a part of many events," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After each ceremony, I usually reflect on where I didn't do well, so that I can improve for the next one."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another student, also surnamed Wong, serves as the flag bearer on the team, and is responsible for raising the flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Normally, we have training on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays each week. The training sessions can sometimes be quite tough because we have to practise marching under the sun, and it gets really hot," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, through the process, we learn to develop a sense of perseverance to overcome hardship."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chau Sai-yiu, chairman of the Association of Hong Kong Flag-guards, said that national security is the cornerstone of a nation’s stability and prosperity, as well as the bedrock of people’s peaceful livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must cherish the current peace and prosperity in Hong Kong. We have gone from chaos to stability, and this peaceful life is thanks to national security. So we all must strengthen our awareness of safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must unite, remain vigilant and support the government in jointly maintaining national security and social stability."
