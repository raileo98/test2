<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires raging in South Korea doubled in size on Thursday from a day earlier, as authorities called the blazes the country's worst natural fire disaster with at least 26 people killed and historic temples incinerated.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 33,000 hectares has been charred or were still burning in the largest of the fires that began in the central Uiseong county, making it the biggest single forest fire in South Korea's history. The previous record was 24,000 hectares in a March 2000 fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are nationally in a critical situation with numerous casualties because of the unprecedented rapid spread of forest fires," Acting President Han Duck-soo told a government response meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military has released stocks of aviation fuel to help keep firefighting helicopters flying to douse flames across mountainous regions in the southeast of the country where fires have been burning now for nearly a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 120 helicopters have been deployed in three regions battling the blazes, the safety ministry said. South Korea relies on helicopters to fight forest fires because of its mountainous terrain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wildfires that originated in Uiseong have been moving rapidly eastward, spreading almost to the coast, carried by gusty winds and with dry conditions aggravating the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the meteorological agency has forecast some rain for the southwest, precipitation is expected to be under five millimetres for most of the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount of rain is going to be small so it doesn't look like it'll be big help in trying to extinguish the fire," Korea Forest Service Minister Lim Sang-seop told a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have said the Uiseong fire showed extremely unusual spread in terms of its scale and speed, and that climate change is expected to make wildfires more frequent and deadly globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Higher temperatures amplified by human-caused climate change contributed to the existing seasonally dry conditions, "turning dry landscapes into dangerous fire fuel" in the region, the Climate Central group, an independent body made up of scientists and researchers, said in a report. (Reuters)

 Asian shares mostly skidded with Wall Street on Thursday while the dollar hovered near a three-week high after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all auto imports, ratcheting up a global trade war that risks fuelling inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, however, the Hang Seng Index rose 60.54 points, or 0.26 percent, to open at 23,543.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, led by heavy losses in automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota Motor shares tumbled 3.4 percent, and both Mazda Motor and Subaru plunged about 6 percent.

  South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.7 percent.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney attends a Liberal Party election campaign rally in Kitchener, Ontario. Carney has vowed to fight Trump's tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797616_1_20250327083849.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<img alt="The short-video app is used by nearly half of all Americans. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797610_1_20250327071906.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

    Teenage Filipino Eala stuns Swiatek at Miami Open

<img alt="Alexandra Eala is the first player from the Philippines to reach the semi-finals of a WTP 1000 tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797607_1_20250327071056.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexandra Eala, a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal," she said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage," said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala will face the winner of Wednesday's quarter-final between Britain's Emma Raducanu and American Jessica Pegula.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have," said Eala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match," she said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denmark welcomed on Wednesday Washington's decision to limit an American delegation's visit to Greenland to a US military base, after previous plans for the unexpected trip sparked criticism.
 <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday that he would accompany his wife Usha on Friday to the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the Danish self-governing island coveted by President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in January, Trump has insisted he wants to take over Greenland for national security purposes, refusing to rule out the use of force to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance's announcement came just hours after Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's outgoing Prime Minister Mute Egede harshly criticised plans by a US delegation to visit the Arctic island uninvited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egede had qualified the initial plans as "foreign interference", noting the outgoing government had not "sent out any invitations for visits, private or official".
  <br>
  <br>
  Following March 11 elections, Greenland has only a transitional government, with parties still in negotiations to form a new coalition government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have asked all countries to respect this process," Egede had said in a Facebook post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the White House announced on Sunday that Usha Vance would travel to Greenland from Thursday to Saturday, while Egede had said US national security adviser Mike Waltz was also expected to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  US media had reported that Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be part of the visit as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usha Vance had been scheduled to view "historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage and watch the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race," in the southwestern town of Sisimiut, the White House had said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frederiksen denounced that visit as "unacceptable pressure" being put on Greenland and Denmark, and vowed "to resist". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened on Wednesday to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages, while the militant group warned they would return "in coffins" if Israel does not stop bombing the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a week since the military resumed operations following a January truce, Israel said two projectiles were fired from the Gaza Strip, with one intercepted and the other landing near the border, and with no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rocket fire came a day after hundreds of Palestinians staged a rare protest against Hamas, chanting slogans against the Islamist movement and calling for an end to the war.

  <br>
  Shattering weeks of relative calm in the war brought by the fragile ceasefire, Israel last week resumed intense bombardment and ground operations across Gaza, while militants returned to launching rocket attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, 830 people have been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its strikes on March 18. No deaths have been reported on the Israeli side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli officials say the resumption of operations was meant to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages, after a stalemate in talks with mediators on extending the truce – which saw 33 Israeli captives freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel wanted an extension of the truce's initial phase, while Hamas demanded talks on a second stage that was meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu told parliament that "the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here," he added, days after his Defence Minister Israel Katz had warned: "The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, said late Wednesday that he was more confident about cracking the top 100 in the men's singles world rankings, following his historic success at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  He became the first player representing Hong Kong, China to make the third round of an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, beating World No. 14 Ben Shelton in the second round before losing to Adam Walton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182 in the world, said he was glad to prove the doubters wrong with his play - and that it's possible for someone from the SAR to beat a top-20 player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to very much thank everyone in Hong Kong for their support. You all motivated me a lot. Especially the doubters - they always seem to say, oh you're not good enough. There isn't a tennis player from the SAR who is able to shine on the world stage, and beat a top 20 player," he told reporters at the airport after returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I want to tell everyone that it's possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old has been training at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's very grateful that the tennis legend had called him to offer his congratulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was super. He found my agent asking for my number, and he called me on his own number. Nadal texted me his congratulations. He says he hopes I can keep going as he thought I gained a lot for Hong Kong," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He called me a world-class player."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he now plans to play at the Barcelona and Madrid opens, saying his coaching team think he's ready for more action on the clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also explained that he drank some coke during matches because he was a bit tired and he wasn't into coffee, so the coaching staff said he could down the soft drink for some caffeine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he felt physically drained while playing in the third round as he wasn't used to the grind at major competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that's an area he would look to make improvements on.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks veered off course on Wednesday after the White House said President Donald Trump would announce fresh tariffs on the auto sector after markets close.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 percent at 42,454.79, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,712.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.0 percent to 17,899.01, while the CBOE Volatility Index -- Wall Street's so-called "fear gauge" -- jumped seven percent, reflecting market jitters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turn in market sentiment followed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks earlier Wednesday that Trump would unveil the "auto industry" tariffs at 4:00 pm (2000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the continuation of worries regarding the tariffs and the impact on the economy," Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital Securities told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is (also) waiting to see what the reciprocal tariffs are going to be on April the 2nd," he added. "So it's a continuation of this wall of worries."
  <br>
  <br>
  US automakers fell on the news, with Tesla closing down 5.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Motors shed 3.1 percent, while Ford initially slipped, before reversing course to finish up 0.1 percent. (AFP)

    Trump announces 25pc tariff on non-US-built cars

<img alt="US President Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797599_1_20250327060802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)

<img alt="In the Signal chat, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth lays out the weather conditions, times of attacks and types of aircraft being used. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797576_1_20250326222631.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday published what it said was the entire text of a chat group mistakenly shared with a journalist by top US national security officials, laying out plans for an imminent attack on Yemen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stunning details, including the times of strikes and types of planes being used, were all laid out in screenshots of the chat, which the officials had conducted on a commercial Signal messaging app, rather than a secure government platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The magazine, which initially only published the broad outlines of the chat, said it was now publishing the details after the Trump administration repeatedly denied that any classified information had been included.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scandal has rocked President Donald Trump's administration, which for now is reacting defiantly – attacking The Atlantic and denying any wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly responded to say The Atlantic was conceding "these were NOT 'war plans.' The entire story was another hoax."
  <br>
  <br>
  National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes had said on Monday the chain cited by The Atlantic appeared to be "authentic."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sent information in the Signal chat – also including Vice President JD Vance and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – right ahead of strikes against the Houthi rebels on March 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  For reasons unknown, Goldberg's phone number had been added to the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goldberg also revealed disparaging comments by the top US officials about European allies during their chat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic initially did not publish the precise details of the chat, saying it wanted to avoid revealing classified material and information that could endanger American troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Tuesday, Ratcliff and other officials involved in the chat played down the scandal, testifying before Congress that nothing critical had been shared or laws broken – and that nothing discussed was classified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said on Wednesday that it had asked the government whether in that case there would be any problem in publishing the rest of the material.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt responded, The Atlantic said, telling the magazine again that "there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat."
  <br>
  <br>
  And a CIA spokesperson asked only that one of the agency's officials referenced in the chain not be identified by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic said its publication on Wednesday included everything in the Signal chain other than that one CIA name.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes Hegseth laying out the weather conditions, times of attacks and types of aircraft being used.
  <br>
  <br>
  The texting was done barely half an hour before the first US warplanes took off and two hours before the first target, described as "Target Terrorist," was expected to be bombed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The details are shockingly precise for the kind of operation that the public usually only learns about later – and in vaguer terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)," Hegseth writes at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)."
  <br>
  <br>
  A short time later, Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz sent real-time intelligence on the aftermath of an attack, writing "Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID" and "amazing job."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthi rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the "axis of resistance" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has stepped up attacks on the group in response to constant Houthi attempts to sink and disrupt shipping through the strategic Red Sea. (AFP)

    UK slashes growth forecast, cuts public spending

<img alt="UK finance minister Rachel Reeves delivers the Spring Statement spending update. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797575_1_20250326221849.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government halved its 2025 growth forecast on Wednesday as it made billions of pounds of spendings cuts to shore up the public purse in the face of economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spring Statement spending update came as the Labour government, elected in July after a landslide election win, faces sluggish economic growth and rising borrowing costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's economy is expected to grow by just one percent this year, revised down from an estimate of two percent made in late October when Labour gave its inaugural budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the UK's spending watchdog, upgraded the country's growth forecast for the three following years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our task is to secure Britain's future in a world that is changing before our eyes," finance minister Rachel Reeves told parliament in the highly-anticipated update.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns over US tariffs and the war in Ukraine have added to the UK's economic woes, chipping away the government's fiscal cushion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat facing our continent was transformed when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invaded Ukraine," Reeves said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that "the job of a responsible government is not simply to watch this change, this moment requires an active government".
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recently pledged to hike spending on defence, with the government confirming Wednesday a £2.2 billion boost next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  To avoid slipping into a deficit, Reeves has cut disability welfare payments and government departmental budgets, blaming a period of heightened uncertainty in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Wednesday's update, the centre-left government announced it would slash the cost of running the civil service by 15 percent over the next five years, targeting annual savings of around £2 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The winner of this year's expanded Club World Cup in the United States will receive up to US$125 million in prize money, Fifa announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total prize fund of US$1 billion for the event, which runs from June 14 to July 13, had already been made public, but Fifa has now broken down the sums for the 32 participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each team will share in the US$525 million pot for participating, while a further US$475 million will be distributed according to performance in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  With additional bonuses, the team that emerges victorious from the seven matches played could receive up to US$125 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe will receive the lion's share of the prize money, with each of their clubs receiving between US$12.81 million and US$38.19 million, the exact amounts to be determined according to sporting and commercial criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  South American teams will each receive US$15.21 million in participation bonuses, while those from North and Central America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa will receive US$9.55 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Auckland City, the Oceania representative, will take home US$3.58 million for taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The distribution model... represents the biggest prize money ever awarded to a competition comprising a group stage and a knockout phase," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino in a press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition to the prize money earmarked for the participating clubs, an unprecedented solidarity programme will be put in place with the aim of redistributing an additional US$250 million to football around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino said all proceeds from the event will be redistributed to club football. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People who have financial difficulties would be able to apply online for waivers of healthcare charges in a few months' time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online applications will be possible under an expansion of waiver mechanism for healthcare charges as part of reforms to the city’s healthcare sector, the Hospital Authority said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  To apply, patients must at present submit documents at public hospitals or social service centres for assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Priscilla Poon, the authority’s chief manager of allied health, said officials are looking to utilise technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are thinking that at about the end of this year we would be able to release a simple version of this waiver app, that the patients are able to access [via] ‘HA Go’ to see how long their waiver period is and what the validity period is,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By around the second quarter of next year, we should be able to launch this online application.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reforms, the government will relax the income and asset requirements for people to qualify for a fee waiver, meaning an extra 1.1 million people will be eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The validity period of each waiver application will be extended from 12 to 18 months, which Poon said is a way to alleviate the workload of medical social workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It reduces the frequency of visits of patients to the medical social worker department,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other changes to the fee waiver mechanism are the inclusion of people aged under 65 who use general outpatient services occasionally and the revision of the definition of “family” to exclude members living with the patient who have no direct financial ties from asset reviews.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The men’s and women’s squad from New Zealand are chasing their third straight Hong Kong Sevens title this weekend when they battle it out at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated rugby tournament will take place for the first time at the new venue from March 28 to 30, having moved away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Zealand men’s squad kicks off their campaign on Friday, facing off Australia in their first pool match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We managed to win the last one in the old stadium. We're trying to create history again and win the first one in the new stadium," men’s squad captain Dylan Collier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should be awesome. Looking around it at the moment, it looks unbelievable. The pitch looks good as well, so it's going to be an awesome tournament coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women’s side, captain Sarah Hirini highlighted the importance of balancing fierce competition and camaraderie.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was seen handing out friendship bracelets to fellow captains during a photo shoot in the stadium on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We love it. We love what Hong Kong's all about. It's a party atmosphere. It's the home of Sevens, and we can't wait to get amongst it this weekend. Hopefully the South Stand will be rocking for us," Hirini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone's pretty competitive at the moment in the way teams are going, and improving over the series has been really awesome for our game. We hope that we do well, but we hope that the games itself are exciting as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hirini's squad opens their tournament against China, which will be joining the main event this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national women's team won the Melrose Claymores – a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens – last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the SAR squads say they are also looking forward to feeding off the home crowd's energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China team co-captain, Natasha Olson-Thorne, said her squad always gets an extra boost while playing at home, and they look to build on their success from last year when they were the runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great playing in front of a home crowd. They always got your back, so I think one of the special feelings to be running out of that tunnel and hearing the cheers from the crowds, and that's definitely motivational," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not pressure, it's just we want to embrace the pressure and play and have a good time."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the men’s side, Hong Kong, China will be looking to defend their Claymores title after last year’s triumph over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's always pressure being the winners from last year. I think some of us are used to it, but some of us are new in the team. So we help each other out and then just have to figure it out on the pitch together," captain James Christie said.

    Seoul found responsible for abuse of adoptions process

<img alt="International adoptions from South Korea began after the Korean War as a way to remove mixed-race children. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797520_2_20250326170321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean official enquiry said on Wednesday the government was responsible for abuse in international adoptions of local children, including record fabrication and inadequate consent, and recommended an official state apology.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It was determined that the state neglected its duty ... resulting in the violation of the human rights of adoptees protected by the constitution and international agreements during the process of sending a lot of children abroad," South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country remains one of the biggest ever exporters of babies in the world, having sent more than 140,000 children overseas between 1955 and 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  International adoptions began after the Korean War as a way to remove mixed-race children, born to local mothers and American GI fathers, from a country that emphasised ethnic homogeneity.
  <br>
  <br>
  It became big business in the 1970s to 1980s, bringing international adoption agencies millions of dollars as the country overcame post-war poverty and faced rapid and aggressive economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, the main driver has been babies born to unmarried women, who still face ostracism in a patriarchal society, and according to academics, are often forced to give up their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a landmark announcement, the country's truth commission concluded after a two-year and seven-month investigation that human rights violations occurred in international adoptions of South Korean children, including "fraudulent orphan registrations, identity tampering, and inadequate vetting of adoptive parents."
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said "numerous cases were identified where proper legal consent procedures" for South Korean birth parents were "not followed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission also said Seoul failed to regulate adoption fees, allowing agencies to set them through "internal agreements," effectively turning it into a profit-driven industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite regulations requiring verification of adoptive parents' eligibility, an overwhelming majority, 99 percent, of intercountry adoption approvals in 1984 alone were granted on the same day or the following day, the commission said, citing its investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These violations should never have occurred," the commission's chairperson Park Sun-young said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a shameful part of our history," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years, Korean adoptees have advocated for their rights, many reporting that their birth mothers were forced to give up their children, leading to the fabrication of records to make them legally adoptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some South Korean birth parents and adoptees even claimed that their children were kidnapped – by agents who sought out unattended children in poor neighbourhoods – or that authorities directed lost children towards adoption without trying to reunite them with their families, in some cases intentionally changing the child's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some adoptees – such as Adam Crapser – were deported to South Korea as adults because their American parents never secured their US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission confirmed human rights violations in only 56 out of 367 complaints, saying there was an overwhelming amount of data to try to verify, and said it would "make efforts" to review the remaining cases before its investigation expires on May 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some adoptees were dissatisfied with this outcome, urging the commission to fully recognise violations in all 367 cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without the truth, our lives rests upon guesses, estimations and creative narratives," Boonyoung Han, a Danish Korean adoptee, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are victims to state violence but without a trace! Literally. Destruction and withholding of our documents must not leave us open to eternal uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanna Johansson, a Korean adoptee in Sweden, said she considers the commission's announcement a "victory" for her adoptee community regardless.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also hope that more and more South Korean [birth] parents who lost their child without their consent will come forward and demand justice," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman has told analysts on an earnings call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see "a substantial rise" in its market share in Britain, which is "very open" to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also sees "great opportunities" to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tuesday meeting, Wang also told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD's profits coming from overseas markets "at a certain stage".
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. (Reuters)

 Lingering hopes that US president Donald Trump's planned tariff blitz next week will not be as painful as feared lifted most Asian markets on Wednesday, though uncertainty about Trump's policies and the US economy tempered optimism.

  Hong Kong battled to edge higher a day after tanking more than two percent on profit-taking and selling in the tech sector.

  The Hang Seng Index ended the day up 0.6 percent at 23,483.

<img alt="Christopher Hui says more than 900 capital investment migrant applications have been received. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797505_1_20250326155229.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said a renewed capital investment migrant scheme could bring investments worth HK$27 billion to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme was launched in March last year, with the minimum amount of investment for applicants tripled to HK$30 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to Legco, financial services minister Christopher Hui said more than 900 applications have been received for the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said about 750 applications have been approved in principle, and some 340 cases have been officially greenlit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said HK$27 billion of investments will be brought into the SAR if all cases are approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said none of the applicants have invested in residential flats so far, and that among the more than HK$10 billion of approved investments, some HK$5.1 billion have been made in collective investment schemes, HK$3.6 billion were put into equities, and HK$1.8 billion were made in debt securities.

    HK, Hainan to cooperate in promoting trade ties

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.

 The Housing Society on Wednesday announced two subsidised flat projects in Fanling and Kwun Tong, with units to be sold at 70 percent of market value, will go on sale in April.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Hemma Fab" project on Jockey Club Road in Fanling offers about 650 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 616 square feet, and prices from HK$2.3 million to HK$5.4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the "Hemma Emerald" project on Anderson Road offers 960 units with saleable areas ranging from 302 to 664 square feet, and prices from about HK$2.5 million to HK$6.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And although the Housing Authority will change the ratio for quota allocation between Green Form and White Form applicants under the Home Ownership Scheme from 40:60 to 50:50 in October, the ratio for the two projects will remain at 40:60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will take reference to [the Housing Authority's] implementation, and we may add these new arrangements in the next phase," the Housing Society's development and marketing director Monita Ko said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko added that about 40 percent of units will be reserved for families with elderly members or newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible people can apply for the two projects from April 1 to 14.

    Certify your subdivided flat early or pay more: govt

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Discounts will be offered to landlords who get their subdivided homes certified early under a proposed certification system, according to housing minister Winnie Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced last year a regulatory regime to manage the city's subdivided units and hope to kick-start the process by the end of this year or early 2026, depending on the legislation process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords will first have 12 months to declare their dwellings as "basic housing units". A grace period of 36 months will follow, not just to help owners complete certification, but also give tenants ample time to relocate if their flat is deemed unsuitable for living.
  <br>
  <br>
  To certify as a basic housing unit, owners must hire a building professional who checks if the flat meets a set of prescribed requirements. If not, modifications will have to be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fee is also payable to the government, and Ho explained why this was necessary in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administrative fees generated by this exercise should not be borne by all taxpayers. We expect to fix the problems involving around 110,000 units within 36 months. There will be a lot of documents for my colleagues to go through. This is the duty of affected landlords, so we’re merely trying to recoup the costs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said landlords who complete the certification in the first 12 months of the grace period will pay the least – or even nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fee then goes up in the second year, and rises again in the final year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expected the fee to be "a few thousand" dollars, with a final decision to be made later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the likelihood that landlords will offload such costs to tenants, Ho pointed out they could turn to public housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a lot of options for tenants. We have 20,000 transitional homes and 30,000 light public housing units. As for traditional public rental housing, 158,000 units will be completed in the next five years… If the rents (for basic housing units) become unreasonable, tenants will have a choice of moving elsewhere," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced that each basic housing unit must also have a window facing the street or semi-enclosed light well for ventilation and lighting reasons. But after hearing views from stakeholders and conducting site visits, Ho confirmed officials may also consider accepting windows facing fully-enclosed light wells, citing constraints of old buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said there are about 2,000 such units around the city, and believes they won't constitute a hygiene issue as long as the light wells are kept clean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will discuss the proposal at a Legislative Council panel next Monday, and Ho said she looks forward to any feedback to fine-tune the arrangements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ta Kung Pao newspaper on Wednesday renewed its criticism of the sale by CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial, Ta Kung Pao said there would be severe consequences if the conglomerate continues on this "wrong path".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the deal to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by the American firm BlackRock should not be considered a normal business decision on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also said the proposed sale undermined China's national interests.

    Seoul court clears opposition leader for top job run

<img alt="Lee Jae-myung appeals for patience outside the court in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797498_1_20250326152240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean appeals court reversed on Wednesday a lower court's ruling and found main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung not guilty of violating the election law, removing a barrier that could have blocked him from running for president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Following the ruling, Lee said the decision by the Seoul High Court completely vindicated him and proved the case was politically motivated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is truly outrageous that all this energy and national resources were spent for what is an obvious outcome," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was handed a one-year prison term suspended for two years by the Seoul Central District Court last year, a penalty that if it had been upheld would have jeopardised his bid to run in the next presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appeals court reversed the earlier ruling that had found Lee guilty of making a false claim during a parliamentary audit in 2021 while running as a presidential candidate about a land development project in Seongnam where he served as mayor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court cases have shone a spotlight on Lee since opinion polls show he is the frontrunner to replace President Yoon Suk yeol if the embattled leader's impeachment is upheld.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will hold a snap election within 60 days if the Constitutional Court upholds the impeachment of Yoon over his short-lived declaration of martial law in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party is regarded as by far the top contender for the next presidential election but faces legal challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear if the prosecution would decide to appeal Wednesday's court decision at the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the election law violation case, he also faces several other trials on matters ranging from bribery to charges mostly linked to a US$1-billion property development scandal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, if lawmakers are convicted of violating the election law and given a fine of one million won or more or even a suspended sentence and the conviction becomes finalised, they are barred from running for elections for at least five years and stripped of their parliament seat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, 61, ran against Yoon in the 2022 presidential election and lost by the slimmest margin in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, he survived a knife attack when he was stabbed in the neck by a man during an event and underwent surgery. (Reuters)

    NBA mulls over creation of a 10-strong European league

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA is to review a proposal to create a European basketball league, a spokesperson has confirmed, after a report detailed a new competition that could feature up to 10 teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sports business news website Sportico said on Tuesday that league owners will consider a plan that includes eight to 10 franchises, including up to four teams who already play in the EuroLeague – Europe's top club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed league would also feature new franchises in cities such as London and Paris, which could be worth as much as US$500 million, Sportico reported, citing a source with direct knowledge of the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  An NBA spokesperson said the league would consider the issue of a European league this week, noting that any new competition would be launched "in partnership" with FIBA, world basketball's governing body.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this week's NBA board of governors' meeting, the league will report on its exploration of a new men's basketball league in Europe, in partnership with FIBA," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rumours of the NBA taking a bigger role in European basketball have swirled for several months, with deputy commissioner Mark Tatum saying in October there was an "untapped opportunity" to grow the sport in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no doubt that I think there is an opportunity for the game of basketball to continue to grow in Europe," Tatum said on a conference call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And, you know, what we're focused on is really working with FIBA and our partners in Europe to tap into this untapped opportunity to further grow the game of basketball there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum noted that despite basketball's popularity in Europe, the sport had "less than a one percent share of the commercial market."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we just think there's an opportunity to have a better model for European basketball," Tatum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sportico reported that while no formal vote on the European league proposal had been scheduled during this week's meetings in New York, team owners could nevertheless vote on the plan "at any time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sportico reported that under the proposal being considered, the NBA would sell permanent franchise slots to outside investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, private capital, wealthy individuals or existing European basketball clubs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday, defeating a challenge from opposition parties who accused her of being a puppet of her father, billionaire ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a two-day censure debate in which the opposition attacked 38-year-old Paetongtarn's management of the country and her inexperience, MPs voted down the no-confidence motion by 319 votes to 162, with seven abstentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn thanked her supporters after winning the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All votes, both for and against, will be a force driving me and the cabinet to carry on working hard for the people," she wrote on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin, the most influential but controversial politician of modern Thai history, returned to the kingdom in 2023 after 15 years of self-exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He served a few months of an eight-year jail sentence for historic graft and abuse of power charges in a police hospital before being pardoned by the king, fuelling rumours of a backroom deal to treat him leniently.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 75-year-old remains popular among millions of poorer Thais who prospered under his 2001-2006 rule but is despised by the kingdom's conservative elite who regard him as corrupt and manipulative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn became prime minister last year at the head of a coalition government led by the Pheu Thai party – the latest incarnation of the political movement founded by Thaksin – after the incumbent Srettha Thavisin was thrown out by a court order.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the censure debate Rangsiman Rome, an outspoken lawmaker with the main opposition People's Party, accused Paetongtarn of engineering preferential treatment for her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You made a deal, a demon deal, to get your father better conditions than other prisoners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The condition was your father will not be in jail for a single day."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn denied the allegation, pointing out that she only became prime minister several months after her father's royal pardon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition MPs also accused Paetongtarn of avoiding tax. (AFP)

    GBA cities need to maximise tourism synergy: survey

<img alt="The study, led by the Polytechnic University, suggests cities in the Greater Bay Area work together to grow the tourism market together. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797477_1_20250326142939.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Findings from a study led by the Polytechnic University’s School of Hotel and Tourism Management have indicated there’s great potential for cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA) to collaborate further in their tourism strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project, which also involved the University of Macau and Sun Yat-sen University, started about two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers conducted site visits to Hong Kong, Macau and nine other GBA cities on the mainland to look at their tourism resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also analysed 200,000 comments from popular online platforms and interviewed 182 residents, tourism officials and business owners in local communities to better understand travel experiences in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study found that GBA cities share many similarities in their tourism strengths, such as food, cultural heritage and natural resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Professor Tony Tse from the study team said the region has failed to take advantage of them, noting that there is a dearth of long-haul travellers in many GBA cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 11 cities have all their attractions, they have their own unique points about tourism... I think they can work together in a very complementary way to attract visitors from both within and outside the region," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Hung Kam, the principal investigator, said GBA cities should build a "regional tourism brand," such as by coming up with travel itineraries that include multiple destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has a very unique cuisine with its [cha chaan teng] and others, such as Michelin restaurants," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau has a very unique cuisine with Portuguese cuisine fusioned with Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Zhongshan has its famous roast pigeon, and Guangzhou has double-skinned milk dessert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So every destination has its uniqueness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we can organise this gastronomy tour, not only to explore cuisines in Hong Kong but across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that could be more appealing to those who only offered Hong Kong cuisine, for example."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PolyU professor said that even though Hong Kong is a well-developed tourism destination, there are still many opportunities for growth through working more closely with others in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proposed authorities in different cities establish a central unit to coordinate regional branding efforts and set up a one-stop online platform to distribute travel information to travellers.

 The organiser of Art Basel Hong Kong said on Wednesday this year's edition aims to strengthen Hong Kong's position as an arts and cultural hub while connecting creative ecosystems across the globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, director Angelle Siyang-Le said the event brings together 240 galleries from 42 countries and places, including 23 newcomers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "it's not only about the number of galleries, what we focus on is the content of what the gallery is bringing," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our galleries continue to bring top quality artworks to our regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That also shows how much the galleries really value the support from the collectors in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siyang-Le said she expects a good turnout especially from Southeast Asia, noting that collectors from the region were showing strong interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from Hong Kong and mainland China, which remain the [biggest groups of people attending], people from the Philippines and Singapore are definitely on the rise," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under moves unveiled in the Budget this year, Art Basel is also partnering with the Tourism Board to create "immersive experience zones" and promote local culture and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to make sure that locally people understand the importance of culture, but more importantly we want to [take the Hong Kong brand international] through all our Basel shows," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to promote the living culture of Hong Kong and most importantly to remind people outside of Hong Kong constantly and regularly that Hong Kong is such an amazing place to visit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The premium art fair will run from Friday to Sunday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the fair expanding into public spaces like M+ Museum and Tai Kwun, Siyang-Le said the moves are happening because she wants to make art accessible beyond just the convention centre.

 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak said there has been a strong response to various government youth programmes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  programme, Mak said application numbers for various activities, such as internships and exchange programmes, have gone up in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister cited a 16-week internship scheme in Dunhuang, Gansu province, during which students learnt the history of the ancient city and trained as tour guides to welcome tourists from all over the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall positive response is due to the proactive outreach by officials in the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have introduced various measures during this term of government. Therefore, we have to get into the schools to introduce all these measures so students are aware of the programmes that they can participate in,” Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youth affairs chief also said the government encourages students who have taken part in these programmes to join “Youth Link”, a network established last September and is part of the Youth Development Blueprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the network already has more than 10,000 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said youngsters can share their experience with fellow students through the “Youth Link”.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that one of the floors in Youth Square in Chai Wan will be renovated and a studio will be set up, so young people can share their stories through videos.

    'All systems go at Kai Tak for rugby showcase'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park said it's ready to host the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We are fine-tuning our arrangements, and we learn from our past experiences. We adjust our operations and enhance communication with various parties and maintain continuous improvement,” Tang King-shing, a Kai Tak Sports Park director, told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are confident that we are ready for the Rugby Sevens.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue experienced mishaps earlier. In one incident, fans at the World Snooker Grand Prix were told to leave while a match was still in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rugby Sevens will take place from Friday to Sunday at the new Kai Tak Stadium, having moved from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security checks will be conducted outside the venue, with spectators asked not to bring long umbrellas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also said they have retained the iconic South Stand – a ground for rugby fans donning elaborate outfits – which will have a “complete upgrade” in its new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are very pleased to see our fans in fancy dress enjoying themselves in the South Stand,” said Hong Kong China Rugby executive director Bryan Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They have a good idea of what is appropriate and what is not. We have a list of prohibited items… We encourage all of our fans to follow that list, to ensure that they’re not bringing in any props that won’t be allowed into the stadium.“
  <br>
  <br>
  A fan village outside the stadium will hold various activities such as live stage performances, and all matches will be shown live on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But organisers said the opening hours at the village will be shorter than previously announced “to make egress as smooth as possible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s still plenty of time for people to enjoy themselves. We don’t view this as a negative, this is a positive response,” said Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said about 43,000 tickets have been snapped up, and is optimistic that the three-day event would be sold out.

    Malls set to get more room for business

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Wednesday officials will soon come up with measures to allow shopping malls to host more business activities within their public open spaces.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came after a revamped ante-chamber meeting at the Legislative Council, where officials bounce ideas off lawmakers based on their membership in specific panels, rather than a more general group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said lawmakers generally welcomed the government's idea for malls, which is meant to give the economy a shot in the arm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we remove barriers and allow owners to make good use of spaces to host activities, to drive up the economic environment in the community?" she told lawmakers after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we streamline our vetting?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn also said officials are studying whether to give floor-area concessions to developers for building carparks above ground and not just for underground facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  For her part, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said she gave an update to lawmakers about how officials have lowered the construction cost to date for building light public housing flats by around HK$6 billion to HK$21 billion mainly through the improved use of modular integrated construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong and development panel chairman Lo Wai-kwok hailed the revamped meeting prodedure, saying it allows more frank and free exchange of ideas between the two sides.

    New A&amp;E fee to bring timely treatment in urgent cases
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1797455-20250326.htm

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797455_1_20250326115900.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health says the new fee for people seeking help at accident and emergency wards in public hospitals can result in quicker treatment for more serious cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January 1 next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients will have to pay HK$400 per visit, up from the present flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the new fee is reasonable, saying that charges for similar services in other places can exceed US$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that category four and five patients, or those deemed as "semi-urgent" and "non-urgent" respectively, now account for 60 percent of the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said this has led to urgent patients – or category three cases – not getting treated in time sometimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have not met the target of treating 90 percent of [category three] patients within 30 minutes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only managed to treat about 70 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we think we should be able to improve on that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through the fee adjustments, we hope to help more category three patients and meet our service targets, allowing them to be treated sooner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the government has taken into account public affordability, how to better utilise services, as well as cost sharing when coming up with the adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that while evening outpatient services have been stepped up, patients will not opt for that if A&E fees remain at a low level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko pointed out that the decision not to exempt category three A&E patients from the fee rise helps to avoid unnecessary arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a lot of colleagues, especially those from A&E," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of triage, it's very clear for category one and two patients because we will look at their vital signs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes, when it comes to category three and four, it's not that easy to differentiate between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the time, it's clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But to avoid unnecessary argument and taking into consideration day-to-day operations, we think that the charge of HK$400 is suitable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the revamp, each drug prescription will be for up to a maximum of four weeks, down from up to 16 weeks at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drugs will cost HK$20 per four-week supply at specialist outpatient clinics and HK$5 at general outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko pointed out that patients can still be dispersed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time, depending on the doctor's prescription.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added public education will be stepped up to ensure that people are aware of the adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires in South Korea have killed 24 people, officials said on Wednesday, warning that the toll in one of South Korea's worst wildfire outbreaks could rise further, with more people injured and the blaze still not under control.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Twenty four people are confirmed dead in the wildfires so far," and 12 seriously injured, a ministry of interior and safety official said, adding that these were "preliminary figures" and the toll could rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blazes are causing "unprecedented damage," acting president Han Duck-soo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen different blazes broke out over the weekend, with the death toll jumping overnight as one major fire tore through villages and burned a historical temple to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has raised the crisis alert to its highest level and declared a "a full-scale national response" to bring the fires under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dry, windy weather has hampered efforts to contain the fires, with the government taking the rare step of evacuating thousands of prisoners out of detention centres in affected counties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, authorities issued an emergency alert for Hahoe Folk Village – a Unesco-listed world heritage site popular with tourists – as the blaze drew closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wildfires burning for a fifth-consecutive day in Ulsan and the Gyeongsang region are causing unprecedented damage," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told an emergency safety and disaster meeting that the blazes were "developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched emergency evacuations on Tuesday afternoon "but sadly, casualties could not be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night, chaos continued as power and communication lines were cut in several areas and roads were blocked," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of firefighters have been deployed, but "strong winds reaching speeds of 25 metres per second persisted from yesterday afternoon through the night, forcing the suspension of helicopter and drone operations," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constantly shifting wind directions and ongoing dry weather advisories have revealed the limitations of conventional firefighting methods," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said the government has launched a "full-scale national response".
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuees sheltering in the gym of Sinsung elementary school said the fire had hit their villages so quickly they did not have time to take anything with them as they fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The wind was so strong," Kwon So-han, a 79-year-old resident in Andong said, adding that as soon as he got the evacuation order he fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire came from the mountain and fell on my house," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who haven't experienced it won't know. I could only bring my body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain is forecast for late Wednesday, with authorities hoping to capitalise on even a light sprinkling to help extinguish the fires. (AFP)

<img alt="Son Heung-min reacts at the end of the match with Jordan that saw South Korea draw again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797449_1_20250326114106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Son Heung-min blamed South Korea's shoddy pitches for their 2026 World Cup qualifying struggles after a 1-1 draw with Jordan left them sweating on an automatic place at the tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Koreans were held at home for a second game in a row on Tuesday after also drawing with Oman last week and hold a precarious lead at the top of Asian qualifying Group B with an away trip to third-placed Iraq still to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's two qualifiers in March were moved away from Seoul because of the capital stadium's poor pitch but skipper Son said the turf was still below par and took aim at his country's football administrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we're at home we're supposed to enjoy the best playing conditions possible but things have not improved at all," the Tottenham striker told reporters after the game in Suwon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know we can play better than this but when conditions on our home soil get in the way, then I wonder where we should get our home advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Poor pitches have been a running theme in South Korean football, with former Manchester United and England forward Jesse Lingard also weighing in last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lingard, who now plays for FC Seoul in the K League, tripped over a chunk of turf while playing at home for his club and later took to social media to air his frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's World Cup qualifier against Iraq in October last year was also moved away from the capital because of the playing conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know this may sound like an excuse, but every small detail matters in football," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can make the difference of getting one point or getting three points. I hope people will pay closer attention to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-sung gave South Korea the lead in the fifth minute before Jordan equalised later in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves the Koreans on top of Group B with 16 points, three ahead of Jordan and four ahead of Iraq, who suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Palestine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two qualify automatically for the World Cup in 2026 in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea play Iraq away in their next game before rounding off their campaign at home to Kuwait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite this disappointment we're still leading the group and that's a fact," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to stay there until the end of the round."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Indonesia head coach Patrick Kluivert said it was "just the beginning" after his Indonesia side beat Bahrain 1-0 in front of nearly 70,000 in Jakarta to breathe new life into their World Cup qualifying hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five days after Barcelona and Dutch great Kluivert saw his team thrashed 5-1 by Australia in his first game as coach, Oxford United's Ole Romeny scored the only goal in the 24th minute for a vital three points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan top Asian qualifying Group C and have already punched their ticket to North America in 2026, with Australia in distant second in the other automatic qualifying place on 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  With two rounds of matches to go, Saudi Arabia are third on 10 points, one point ahead of Indonesia in fourth, with Bahrain and China on six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing third and fourth go into another round of qualifying – Indonesia's most likely route to their first World Cup since gaining independence as a country in 1945. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka battled back in the second set to blast her way into the semi-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 7-5 win over China's Zheng Qinwen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory  on Tuesday gives Sabalenka her first place in the last four at Miami, with a clash against Italy's Jasmine Paolini standing between her and a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It looked like it was going to be routine business for the Belarussian against the ninth-seed Zheng when Sabalenka took the first set comfortably.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng had worked something out between sets and came out firing, breaking Sabalenka twice to open up a 4-2 lead in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was in real trouble at 0-40 down but, after some signs of anger, was able to fight back to hold for 4-4 and then turned her aggression into a powerful finale.
  <br>
  <br>
  With some blistering returns, the top-seed broke to go 6-5 and then with her serve at full force, confidently held to secure the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Paolini moved into the semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, beaten in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to make it to the last four in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took just 77 minutes for Paolini to take care of business against Linette who had progressed into the quarters with a surprise win over Coco Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy delay to the start of the game, caused by heavy rain in the afternoon, didn't cause any issues for the sixth-seeded Paolini who dominated from the off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, who is looking for her second title at the WTA 1000 level, after last year's triumph in Dubai, looked confident and said she had known her form would start to bring her results.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there – maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's two quarters see second-seed Iga Swiatek up against Alexandra Eala, the wild-card teenager from the Philippines, who has already beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

<img alt="The Hospital Authority said it would not resume the use of the light in question until thorough checks are completed. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797428_1_20250326094629.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has suspended the use of about 200 examination lights of the same model as that involved in a recent incident that saw a surgical lamp fall at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital in Tsuen Wan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority said late on Tuesday that it has been notified of the incident, which saw the lamp hit a doctor and a healthcare staff while a patient was under examination, by the Department of Health and the manufacturer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a precautionary measure, the Hospital Authority has immediately halted the use of all ceiling-mounted examination lights of the relevant model," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temporary replacements from other manufacturers or using different models have been carried out to ensure that clinical services remain unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority urged the manufacturer to complete thorough inspections as soon as possible and to guarantee the safety of the examination lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until then, it said, hospitals and clinics will not use the model.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that all ceiling-mounted medical equipment in hospitals and clinics undergo regular maintenance and servicing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will closely monitor the manufacturer to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and servicing of medical equipment, safeguarding the safety of both patients and staff.

<img alt="Novak Djokovic breezed past Italy's Lorenzo Musetti to book his spot in the next round in Miami. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797434_1_20250326101120.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic cruised into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Italian Lorenzo Musetti in one hour 22 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musetti, the 15th seed from Tuscany, got off to a flying start to take a 2-0 lead in the first set but then proceeded to lose the next nine games as the Serb, looking confident and sharp, ran away with the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic has won the Miami Open on six occasions but has not featured in the quarters since his last victory here in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old is now just three wins away from winning his 100th tour-level title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had a really good start of the match. First couple games I started a little bit slow and then I knew that if I give him time, he's going to make his shots," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He loves kind of running around his backhand, hitting forehands. But he is so talented, he can play any shot in the game on any surface," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, particularly in the first seven, eight games of the match. But I think breaking his serve to come back to two-all and break right away at 3-2, it was a momentum shift and I tried to use that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will face American Sebastian Korda on Wednesday for a place in the semi-finals after the 24th seed beat French veteran Gael Monfils 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in a rain-affected match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda visibly struggled with his wrist, however, and said after the match that he had been in discomfort with an injury that has caused him trouble in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty painful right now, we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Will do a lot of work with my physio now, we'll see how it is tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't played a lot of tournaments this year. Hopefully I can play some good tennis and see where it takes me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda later pulled out of his doubles match with partner Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo upset fifth-seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-2 to take his place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, who enjoys plenty of support from South Florida's large Argentine community, has now reached the last eight in three of his past four appearances at Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo failed to make the most of three break points in the opening game but eventually broke through at 3-3, converting his fourth break point of that game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23rd seed, who lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, was dominant in the second set, but his victory was postponed by a three-hour, 30-minute rain delay that arrived when he was 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy. It's always difficult when you're playing a really good match, controlling the game, and you have to stop for rain," said Cerundolo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy, but I was chill and came back to the match confident and played a really good service game. I'm super happy to get back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals in the US, on hard courts. It's a great achievement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Cerundolo is 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated American Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day after a thrilling three-set win over Brazilian Joao Fonseca, Australia's Alex de Minaur was eliminated by tenth-seed Italian Matteo Berrettini who triumphed 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini had the chance to close out the match when serving at 6-5 but let three match points slip and the match went into a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur then had a great chance to force a deciding set when he was 6-3 up but was unable to convert the three set points and Berrettini was able to claw back victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian will face third-seed Taylor Fritz who progressed with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Australia lucky loser Adam Walton. (AFP)

<img alt="Authorities stand outside the house of the grandparents of Emile Soleil. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797420_1_20250326091733.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A months-long investigation into the mysterious death of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested four people including the boy's grandparents on suspicion of murder and concealment of a body.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death of Emile Soleil, a boy of two-and-a-half who went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, had remained unexplained even after some of his remains were discovered nine months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors at the time said the cause of his death could have been "a fall, manslaughter or murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile had been staying at the summer home of his maternal grandparents in the tiny hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Emile's mother and father were absent on the day he disappeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sharp turn of events on Tuesday, the boy's 59-year-old grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of voluntary homicide and concealment of a corpse, said Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two adult children of the couple were also arrested, Blachon added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's arrests were the result of fact-finding "over recent months", the prosecutor told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month investigators had returned to the village, sparking talk of a development in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large flowerpot with traces of blood had been seized by the investigators in front of a local church, a source close to the case told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several years ago the boy's grandfather had been questioned over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school in the 1990s where he was a scout leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had initially considered his possible involvement in Emile's death as only one of many hypotheses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps what is happening is not what we had expected," said Philippe Vedovini's lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, when questioned by police in Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that "being placed in police custody means nothing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Julien Pinelli, who represents Emile's grandmother, Anne Vedovini, said that she wanted nothing more than to learn "the truth about this tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if this measure is necessary to find the truth, of course she will submit to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern village of La Bouilladisse, an AFP reporter saw police conduct a search of the couple's main home, an affluent farmhouse. They have seized an SUV and a horse trailer.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the neighbours, who did not wish to give his name, saw the police detain Vedovini, who is an osteopath, and his wife at 7 am in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, they're quiet neighbours," he said. "They've been under pressure for the past two years, that's for sure. They have lived in a reclusive manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile was last seen walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000 feet) up in the French Alps, in the late afternoon of July 8, 2023. He was wearing a yellow T-shirt, white shorts and tiny hiking shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A massive search failed to find any sign of the boy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine months later, a walker discovered his skull and teeth 1.7 kilometres from the village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later found more bones and items of the boy's clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, a traditional Catholic funeral mass for the toddler was held in the Basilica of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, a Unesco-listed medieval Gothic cathedral said to house relics of Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus Christ.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hundred mourners were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile's grandparents and parents are devout Catholics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying "the period of silence must yield to the period of truth."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to understand. We need to know," they said. (AFP)

<img alt="Brazil's midfielder Joao Gomes walks off the pitch downcast as Argentina's players celebrate their win over Brazil at the Mas Monumental stadium in Buenos Aires. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797405_2_20250326110003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina celebrated their 2026 World Cup qualification with a dazzling 4-1 thrashing of arch-rivals Brazil in Buenos Aires.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julian Alvarez, Enzo Fernandez, Alexis Mac Allister and Giuliano Simeone sealed an emphatic win on Tuesday for the world champions, who had been assured of their World Cup berth after Bolivia's 0-0 draw with Uruguay earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That goalless stalemate ensured a festive atmosphere at the Estadio Monumental before a ball had been kicked and Argentina kept the party going with a blistering performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico Madrid forward Alvarez opened the scoring after just six minutes, latching onto Thiago Almada's through ball and dinking a close-range finish past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  It got better for Argentina six minutes later when Chelsea's Fernandez tucked away the hosts' second goal of the night after Brazil's back four failed to deal with a low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Brazil being run ragged by a rampant Argentina, they were thrown a lifeline on 26 minutes after a blunder by Cristian Romero gifted a goal to Mattheus Cunha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Romero was caught in possession 25 yards from goal, allowing Cunha to steal in and drive a low shot past Emiliano Martinez to make it 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any hopes of a Brazilian fightback were snuffed out in the 37th minute with a superb goal from Mac Allister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almada was once again the creator, lofting a pass into the area which Mac Allister met with a first-time volley to make it 3-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Argentina in complete control, Simeone then brought the house down with a 71st minute strike to make it 4-1 – his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone, the 22-year-old son of Argentine legend Diego Simeone, somehow blasted into the roof of the net from an acute angle to crown a dominant performance by the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means Argentina have qualified for next year's finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada with four games to spare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentines lead the 10-team qualifying group with 31 points from 14 games and are guaranteed one of the six automatic qualifying slots awarded to South America. Brazil are fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American games, Ecuador stayed on course for qualification with a 0-0 draw against Chile in Santiago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador are second in the standings, eight points adrift of Argentina on 23 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uruguay's draw with Bolivia – and Brazil's heavy loss – allowed them to move up to third place on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia meanwhile missed the chance to close the gap on the leaders after a 2-2 home draw with Paraguay in Barranquilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Luis Diaz and Jhon Duran fired Colombia into a 2-0 lead after just 13 minutes but Paraguay grabbed a share of the points with goals from Junior Alonso and Julio Enciso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela boosted their hopes of a first-ever World Cup qualification with a 1-0 win over Peru in Maturin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salomon Rondon's 41st-minute penalty secured three precious points for Venezuela, who are the only South American team never to have qualified for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela's win lifted them into seventh place in the table, leaving them on course for an inter-confederation playoff. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reached deals on Tuesday with Ukraine and Russia to pause attacks at sea and against energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some sanctions against Moscow in its latest step towards endorsing Russia's positions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The separate agreements are the first formal commitments by the warring sides since the inauguration of Donald Trump, who is pushing for an end to the war and a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that has alarmed Kyiv and European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US agreement with Russia goes further than the agreement with Ukraine, with Washington committing to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a persistent Russian demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless links between some Russian banks and the international financial system were restored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this was untrue, and there was no requirement of sanctions relief for the deals to come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, even now, even today, on the very day of negotiations, we see how the Russians have already begun to manipulate," Zelensky said in his nightly video address. "They are already trying to distort agreements and, in fact, deceive both our intermediaries and the entire world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and Moscow both said they would rely on Washington to enforce the deals, while expressing scepticism that the other side would abide by them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: "We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelensky and his team to do one thing and not the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said the truce agreements would take effect immediately, and that if Russia violated them he would ask Trump to impose additional sanctions on Moscow and provide more weapons for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no faith in the Russians, but we will be constructive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were reached after parallel talks in Saudi Arabia that followed separate phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin rejected Trump's proposal for a full ceasefire lasting 30 days, which Ukraine had previously endorsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has nevertheless softened its rhetoric towards Russia in recent days, with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff saying he did not "regard Putin as a bad guy", alarming European officials who consider the Russian leader a dangerous enemy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat, in which case Ukraine would have the full right to self-defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has attacked Ukraine's power grid with missiles and drones throughout the war, arguing that civil energy infrastructure is a legitimate target because it helps Ukraine's warfighting capability.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, Ukraine has been launching long-range strikes on Russian oil and gas targets, which it says provide fuel for Russia's troops and income to fund its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the pause in attacks on energy would last for 30 days from March 18, when Putin first discussed it with Trump. Ukraine had said last week that it would accept such a pause only after a formal agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement on a truce at sea addresses an issue that was critical early in the war, when Russia imposed a de facto naval blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, worsening a global food crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, maritime battles have been only a comparatively small part of the war since Russia withdrew its naval forces from the eastern Black Sea after a number of successful Ukrainian attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has been able to reopen its ports and resume exports at around pre-war levels, despite the collapse of a previous UN-brokered Black Sea shipping agreement, but its ports have come under regular air attack. Zelensky said the agreement would bar such strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said the agreement would require sanctions relief including restoring links between Russia's agricultural export bank and the Swift international payments system. That and other steps could require agreement from European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been pressing Moscow and Kyiv to bring a rapid end to the war, a goal he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Russia that Washington and Moscow say could lead to lucrative business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its Nato ambitions and give up land claimed by Moscow. (Reuters)

    US stocks make minor gains on tariff hopes

<img alt="Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797399_1_20250326062321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly closed higher on Tuesday, building on earlier gains amid hopes that US President Donald Trump might take a narrower approach to upcoming tariffs than originally expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 42,587.50, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 5,776.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.5 percent to 18,271.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The absence of bad news is good news for stocks," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there has been "so much bad news" over the last few weeks that the respite on Tuesday allowed investors to breathe a sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, markets are waiting for further hints about Trump's upcoming tariff rollout, with the president having promised "reciprocal tariffs" tailored to each trading partner on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump earlier signaled that sector-specific levies hitting industries like automobiles and semiconductors could come around the same day, the White House said Monday that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March, the Conference Board said, with survey respondents flagging growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, new US home sales picked up slightly less than expected last month, with analysts warning that tariffs could raise costs for homebuilders -- weighing on the market subsequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting updates on US GDP data released Thursday, and the release of a key inflation gauge due Friday. (AFP)

    World Athletics approves swab test to determine gender

<img alt="The president of the international track and field federation said the female category had to be protected. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797391_1_20250326033236.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics said on Tuesday it had approved the introduction of a cheek swab test to determine if an athlete is biologically female.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sebastian Coe, the president of the international track and field federation, said the test, whose introduction was given the green light by the World Athletics Council, was a "really important" way of protecting the female category.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it," Coe said in a press conference after the Council met over two days in Nanjing, China following the World Indoor Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics has not fixed a date for the introduction of the test, but it is expected to be in place for the outdoor World Championships in Tokyo this September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe said the decision to introduce the swab testing was taken after a wide consultation on the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overwhelmingly, the view has come back that this is absolutely the way to go," Coe said, adding that the swab test was not considered to be overly intrusive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was confident that the policy could stand up to legal challenge, but added: "You accept the fact that that is the world we live in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would never have set off down this path to protect the female category in sport if I'd been anything other than prepared to take the challenge head on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (difference of sex development) regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we'll do whatever is necessary to do it. And we're not just talking about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics is looking at cheek swab tests but is also considering using blood spot tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test for the SRY gene, which is "almost always on the male Y chromosome" and "is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex", would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career, the federation says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe warned during his campaign to be elected International Olympic Committee president "that we run the risk of losing women's sport" unless the female category was protected. (AFP)

<img alt="Gerard Depardieu, 76, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797392_1_20250326035129.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court on Tuesday that he was not in the habit of "groping" women, and called the #MeToo movement a "reign of terror".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts," Depardieu said in his first statement at the trial, in which he is charged with sexual assault on two women during the shooting of a film in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not somebody who rubs himself against others on the metro," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu said he was "not like that" in response to the accusations, adding that "there are vices that are alien to me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu, 76, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I deny all of it," the actor, dressed in black, said in the packed courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court on Tuesday "will become a reign of terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial relates to charges of sexual assault during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" ("The Green Shutters") by director Jean Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anouk Grinberg, a prominent actor who appeared in the film, has backed the two plaintiffs – a set dresser, 54, identified only as Amelie, and a 34-year-old assistant director. Both women allege sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another prominent actor Fanny Ardant is expected to testify in favour of Depardieu later this week. (AFP)

    Trump, intel chiefs dismiss chat breach

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and his top intelligence officials raced on Tuesday to stem a growing scandal after a journalist was accidentally added to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels in a security breach.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump brushed off the leak as a "glitch," while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged in the conversation on the Signal messaging app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also defended his National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who added Atlantic's magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat by mistake ahead of the air strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told broadcaster NBC that the breach was "the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one". Waltz "has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – who were both reported to be in the chat – both endured a stormy Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over the leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no classified material that was shared," Gabbard, who has previously caused controversy with comments sympathetic to Russia and Syria, told the committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She refused however to comment on whether Signal had been installed on her personal phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed he was involved in the Signal group and had the app installed on his work computer, but said the communications were "entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information".
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats on the committee called on Waltz and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senator Mark Warner blasted what he called "sloppy, careless, incompetent behaviour". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China and hosts Singapore battled to a goalless draw on Tuesday night as they began the final round of their AFC Asian Cup football qualifying campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  This extended Hong Kong’s unbeaten run against Singapore to seven games, of which the SAR had secured victories on three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was the hosts who dominated the first half, forcing the SAR squad to sub out attacking midfielder Wong Wai for defender Yue Tze-nam in the 34th minute to withstand the pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad had a much better performance after the break, building a more structured offence, but could not catch a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts had two goals disallowed, including a lovely chip shot by Shawal Anuar in the 77th minute that was ruled offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be back to play at Kai Tak Sports Park on June 10 against India for their next qualifying match.
  <br>
  <br>
  To earn a spot in the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia, the SAR will need to come out on top of Group C, which also features Bangladesh.

 China's hopes of directly qualifying for the 2026 World Cup took a hit after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Australia on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jackson Irvine scored a brilliant curling shot to open the scoring for the Aussies in the 16th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  An error by China’s goalkeeper Wang Dalei shocked the home crowds at Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium 13 minutes later, as he let a weak shot by Nishan Velupillay slip through his fingers.
  <br>
  <br>
  China made four changes after the break and threw bodies forward in search of a goal but those efforts were in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the loss, the national team stayed at the bottom of the group of six, seven points behind second place Australia with two matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two teams of the group directly qualify for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  China now need to fight for a fourth-place finish in the group to advance to the fourth qualifying round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their two remaining group matches are against Indonesia and Bahrain.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coleman Wong’s history-making performance at the Miami Open will serve as a huge morale boost for the SAR’s next generation of tennis players, Hong Kong, China’s tennis chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old became the first-ever player from the SAR to get a win at a Masters 1000 match, and reached the event’s round of 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Cheng, president of Hong Kong China Tennis Association, said it was a remarkable achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The draw size of a 1000 event is actually 96, which means that we're putting him inside the top 100 players in the world and he is able to get through a couple of rounds,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He's done something which no one has done before in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The city’s tennis boss said Wong’s groundbreaking result would inspire a lot of young players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we're looking at in the tennis generation here overall is to make sure that one generation is better than the last one,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, tennis has retained its "Tier A" sport status for two more years, avoiding a significant funding cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the decision is vital to the development of the sport in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not just about the funding, but it's also about the coaching and the technical support and the strength and conditioning support and the sports science support coming from the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you put it all together, it's the complete package,” he said.

<img alt="Experts say family doctors should educate patients about whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797359_1_20250325203807.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A family physician said on Tuesday that the government's overhaul of healthcare charges could motivate people to prioritise their overall health instead of only focusing on treating a disease.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-lim, vice president of general affairs at the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians, said it is important for family doctors to educate patients about urgent and non-urgent symptoms so they could decide whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we promote health – and with a healthy lifestyle and with a very good management of chronic diseases – a lot of complications and a lot of acute conditions can be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In turn, it will reduce the attendance to specialist operations departments or the A&E department."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Lau pointed out that the cost of advanced pathology and non-urgent imaging tests in the public sector remain significantly lower than those in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Head of healthcare and social innovation at Our Hong Kong Foundation, Dicky Chow, welcomed the government's review of the public healthcare fee structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow believes it will enhance the healthcare system’s sustainability and ensure that public funds are used more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chow urged the government to enhance the capacity of outpatient and primary care services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also suggested that authorities should establish more evening clinics and better utilise community pharmacies to help meet demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) expressed the concern that the proposed fee adjustments could add significant financial burden to grassroots and lower-middle class patients with chronic illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They emphasised the need for a more comprehensive medical fee waiver system to prevent these groups from missing out on necessary treatments due to financial constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested that the government should clarify how increased fees would enhance public healthcare services.

<img alt="Vietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan (centre) looks on at a court in Ho Chi Minh City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797356_1_20250325193707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The appeal of a Vietnamese property tycoon convicted of money laundering began on Tuesday, three months after she lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Property developer Truong My Lan was found guilty in April 2024 of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and sentenced to death for fraud amounting to US$27 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan appealed against that verdict and the court said there was no basis to reduce her sentence, but ruled that she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three quarters of the stolen assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now she is appealing against the verdict from a second trial in October, in which she was sentenced to life in prison for three crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Lan, now accustomed to high-profile hearings, chatted with police officers and looked relatively relaxed as she waited for the court to start in Ho Chi Minh City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her niece, who was handed a five-year prison term in October for fraudulent appropriation of property, sat behind her, flanked by officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 68-year-old was found guilty of laundering US$17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of US$4.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also found guilty of bond fraud to the tune of US$1.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court determined that Lan was "the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three other defendants were also sentenced at the court in Ho Chi Minh City and given terms ranging from two to 23 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-seven of them are appealing against their sentences, state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam totalled US$27 billion - equivalent to around six percent of the country's 2023 GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan owned just five percent of shares in SCB on paper but at her trial the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 percent through family, friends and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims. (AFP)

<img alt="Paul Chan says AI will act as a catalyst in helping Hong Kong become a more sustainable society. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797342_1_20250325181504.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said that artificial intelligence is a game changer for Hong Kong in its goal to become a more sustainable society, as the city goes all out to achieve its carbon emission goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks on the second day of the "2025 Hong Kong Climate Forum" in Kowloon, where he also noted that there is an urgency to speed up the green transition in the face of more frequent extreme weather events, record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, as well as increasing stress on the public health system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Hong Kong is dedicated to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and is especially focusing on net-zero electricity generation, green transport, buildings, and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary said that not only can AI empower specific green tech but it can act as a catalyst for encouraging behaviourial changes, while transforming various sectors and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clearly, AI has vast potential in optimising energy production and consumption," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI can also accelerate the invention of new materials. It can improve climate modelling and forecasting, enhancing our preparedness in the face of natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From energy-saving tech for home appliances and vehicles to smarter traffic management, these innovations are spreading across our country and the world at large," he said, adding that AI could also help optimise capital arrangements to achieve sustainable returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that Hong Kong is now developing AI on five fronts, including in super-computing capabilities, algorithms, data, capital, and talent.

<img alt="Michel Platini, left, and Sepp Blatter were cleared of fraud mismanagement by a Swiss court. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797334_1_20250325173315.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court on Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former Fifa president and former Uefa president were acquitted for a second time on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of two million Swiss francs of Fifa money in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers and held his left hand over his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorney general’s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter approved Fifa paying the sum to France football great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential adviser from 1998 to 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly nine and a half years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of soccer’s most powerful men.
  <br>
  <br>
  That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at Fifa after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter’s reputation likely always will be tied to leading Fifa during corruption crises that took down a swathe of senior football officials worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, one of football’s greatest players and later Blatter’s protege in the sport's politics, never did get the Fifa presidency he often called his destiny. (AP)

    Microplastics fear for those who chew gum

<img alt="Researchers say a gram of gum releases an average of 100 microplastic fragments and that some shed more than 600. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797333_1_20250325172205.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chewing gum releases hundreds of tiny plastic pieces straight into people's mouths, researchers said on Tuesday, also warning of the pollution created by the rubber-based sweet.
 <br>
  <br>
  The small study comes as researchers have increasingly been discovering small shards of plastic called microplastics throughout the world, from the tops of mountains to the bottom of the ocean – and even in the air we breathe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also been discovered microplastics riddled throughout human bodies – including inside our lungs, blood and brains – sparking fears about the potential effect this could be having on health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to alarm people," said Sanjay Mohanty, the lead researcher behind the new study.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no evidence directly showing that microplastics are harmful to human health, said Mohanty of the University of California, Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new pilot study instead sought to illustrate yet another little-researched way that these mostly invisible plastic pieces enter our bodies  – chewing gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Lowe, a PhD student at UCLA, chewed seven pieces each of 10 brands of gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the researchers ran a chemical analysis on her saliva.
  <br>
  <br>
  They found that a gram of gum released an average of 100 microplastic fragments, though some shed more than 600.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average weight of a stick of gum is around 1.5 grams.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who chew around 180 pieces of gum a year could be ingesting roughly 30,000 microplastics, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This pales in comparison to the many other ways that humans ingest microplastics, Mohanty emphasised.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, other researchers estimated last year that a litre of water in a plastic bottle contained an average of 240,000 microplastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most common chewing gum sold in supermarkets is called synthetic gum, which contains petroleum-based polymers to get that chewy effect, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, packaging does not list any plastics in the ingredients, simply using the words "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohanty said that "nobody will tell you the ingredients."
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers tested five brands of synthetic gum and five of natural gum, which use plant-based polymers such as tree sap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was surprising that we found microplastics were abundant in both," Lowe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gum shed almost all of the microplastics during the first eight minutes of chewing, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Jones, a researcher at the UK's University of Portsmouth not involved in the study, said manufacturers should be forced to give more specific ingredients than just "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones said he was surprised that the researchers found certain plastics not known to be in gum, suggesting they could have possibly come from another source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the overall findings were "not at all surprising", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  People tend to "freak out a little bit" when told that the building blocks of chewing gum were similar to what is found "in car tyres, plastic bags and bottles", Jones said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowe also warned about the plastic pollution from chewing gum – particularly when people "spit it out onto the sidewalk".
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, which has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but not yet published, was presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the forum was Chief Executive John Lee, who said Hong Kong is a global city connecting the world, and that the SAR will continue to promote free trade and market liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are devoted to deepening international exchange and collaboration. Hong Kong has signed investment agreements covering 33 economies, and free trade agreements covering 21 economies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aspire to add the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade pact – to our free trade agreements soon, and better contribute to regional cooperation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Equities diverged on Tuesday, as investors struggled to extend Wall Street's rally despite easing fears over US president Donald Trump's planned tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asian stocks fluctuated through the day, with Hong Kong sinking 2.3 percent to 23,344, weighed by a drop of around six percent in tech giant Xiaomi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi had raised US$5.5 billion in a mega share sale as it looked to expand its electric vehicle business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, which comes after a similar move this month by EV firm BYD, stoked worries about market liquidity. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Art Central fair is returning to Central Harbourfront from Wednesday with works from more than 100 galleries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Corey Andrew Barr, the fair director, said he expects a good turnout for the event, which features workshops, installations and art performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Last year we had over 40,000 people here and we expect to see something similar this year, if not greater,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark its 10th anniversary, the fair debuts the "Legend" gallery to highlight lesser-known artists from earlier generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the works on show is a collection by Japanese “rainbow artist” Ay-O as presented by Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So the Legend section is a new thing for us,” said Inessa Li, art adviser at Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the art fair, we are just very honoured to participate in it and get more people to know this excellent talented artist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In partnership with the Tourism Board, the fair presents three artists who explored and created works inspired by Central and Sheung Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po neighbourhoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can experience the creative process in a transformed art booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because they all have their own stories that are related to the neighbourhood through their artistic approach, we want to show what's the art related to the neighbourhood and what's the significance of Hong Kong's different areas,” said curator Shirky Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cornerstone art fair runs until Sunday.

<img alt="Daniela Klette is led away to a helicopter after a detention review hearing in Karlsruhe last March. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797316_1_20250325155616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former member of Germany's far-left Baader-Meinhof gang who was arrested last year after more than 30 years on the run will face trial on Tuesday for a series of armed robberies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Daniela Klette, 66, was part of the radical anti-capitalist group also known as the Red Army Faction, which carried out a series of bombings, kidnappings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was arrested in February 2024 at her Berlin flat, where police found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, explosives and large sums of cash, after apparently hiding there in plain sight for two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks earlier, the creators of a German "most wanted" podcast had stumbled across photos of Klette on Facebook attending capoeira classes in Berlin, though it is unclear whether this led to her arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial starting on Tuesday in the northern city of Celle relates to robberies Klette allegedly committed with two other gang members to finance their life on the run after the RAF disbanded in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  After she was detained, prosecutors also had Klette formally arrested on suspicion of involvement in three attacks in the 1990s, while the gang was still active.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named after two of its early leaders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, the Baader-Meinhof gang emerged out of the radical fringe of the 1960s student protest movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's members took up arms against what they saw as US imperialism and a "fascist" German state that was still riddled with former Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the height of its notoriety in 1977, the group shot dead a German bank chief and kidnapped and killed industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, a former SS officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the so-called German Autumn of 1977 marked the beginning of a long period of decline for the RAF, the group continued to operate for another two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette was part of a notorious trio – along with fellow gang members Ernst-Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg – who were active as part of the RAF's "third generation" in the 1980s and 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the RAF disbanded, Klette and the two men are believed to have financed their lives in hiding through armed robberies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for Staub and Garweg, who would now be 71 and 56 if they are still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial in Celle relates to four attacks on money transporters and nine cash heists from shops in which the suspects got away with a total of 2.7 million euros, according to prosecutors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette is said to have acted mainly as the getaway driver but also faces one charge of attempted murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said she carried a "realistic-looking" dummy bazooka during some of the heists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial is set to last around two years and will hear from 12 witnesses, according to the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette reportedly put up no resistance when she was arrested at her apartment in Berlin's bohemian Kreuzberg neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to German media reports, she had been using a fake Italian passport and going by the name of Claudia Ivone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neighbours told the Bild daily she had a partner about the same age as her and always said "hello" when she went out walking with her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette had no bank account and likely paid her rent in cash, possibly for several months or years at a time, according to Der Spiegel magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacks Klette is accused of committing in the 1990s, which are being dealt with in separate proceedings, include an attempted assault on a Deutsche Bank building in Eschborn, near Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is also accused of playing a role in a 1991 RAF attack on the US embassy in Bonn, which was the German capital at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third accusation relates to a 1993 explosives attack against a prison then still under construction in Germany's Hesse state. (AFP)

 Beijing is willing to work with Portugal to build a more stable, fruitful and dynamic relationship, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Portuguese counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is also willing to work with Portugal to promote China and Europe to become strategic partners with mutual trust, Wang said, adding that China supports Europe in maintaining its "strategic autonomy", according to a ministry statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China regards Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, and supports Europe in maintaining its strategic autonomy," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Portugal's Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel is visiting China this week, the first to the nation by a high-level Portuguese government official in over five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top officials in Beijing and European capitals are looking at each other with renewed interest as US President Donald Trump's administration threatens to upend transatlantic ties and global trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from Rangel, the French foreign minister and Italy's Senate president are all scheduled to visit China this week. (Reuters)

    Abe assassination probe leads to church's dissolution

<img alt="The Unification Church's Tokyo headquarters in Shibuya. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797307_1_20250325151020.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church in Japan, upholding a government request for a revocation spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tokyo District Court’s revocation of the church’s legal status means it will lose its tax-exempt privilege and must liquidate its assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the church can still appeal the decision to higher courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order follows a request by Japan’s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into the 2022 assassination of Abe revealed decades of cozy ties between the South Korea-based church and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in 1968 amid an anti-communist movement supported by Abe’s grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan’s civil code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two earlier case involved criminal charges – the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan has in place hurdles for restraining religious activities due to lessons from the prewar and wartime oppression of freedom of religion and thought.
