<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary on Sunday said he believes the Hong Kong market is stable and attractive, especially against the backdrop of global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Paul Chan also urged different sectors to lure foreign capital and talent amid changes in the global market, saying the United States' so-called reciprocal tariffs have caused severe volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR government will maintain vigilance and enhance monitoring, forecasting, and planning to cope with the evolving situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can break new ground amid the changing landscape, as long as people stay united and do their best," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many large-scale international financial institutions and long-term capital are looking to step up participation in the Hong Kong market, he added, while overseas scientists and scholars are considering relocating to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively attracting quality issuers from all over the world to list in Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that the Securities and Futures Commission and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing have been instructed to make preparations for a possible surge in mainland firms looking to list in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a related note, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui has voiced his confidence in the Hong Kong market, saying it has gone through many challenges before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, the minister said authorities will continue to enhance the market's safety, stability and foreseeability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a market operator, what we need to achieve is a credible market which both buyers and sellers will participate in, and it needs to operate smoothly," Hui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As in the past, when even the macro environment, like what you said, is more complicated, it is important for us to stay calm and continue our work."

 Hong Kong, China's Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet made a triumphant return to international competition, securing their first Badminton Asia Championships mixed doubles title in Ningbo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duo, pairing up for the first time since December's World Tour Finals, overcame Japan's Hiroki Midorikawa and Natsu Saito in a thrilling final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong pair started strong, taking the opening game 21-15, but their Japanese world number 11 opponents rallied to claim the second game 21-17 to set up a decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was proved to be the SAR pair's day as they dominated the third game, winning eight consecutive points at one stage en route to a 21-13 win, lifting the Asian title for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks Hong Kong's second mixed doubles gold at the event after Reginald Lee and Chau Hoi-wah won it 11 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse came into the final riding high on confidence, having pulled off a semi-final upset over China's top-ranked Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday reaffirmed investors that Hong Kong will continue to welcome global business as a free port during "turbulent" times in global development.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking at the opening of InnoEX, a four-day innovation and technology trade event featuring more than 450 exhibitors from 13 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing guests in a speech, the financial minister acknowledged "a shifting global landscape marked by a daunting trade war and technological fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged businesses to adapt by finding new partners, exploring untapped markets, and adopting more flexible business models in what he called the "new normal".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also declared that it is in "Hong Kong's DNA" to establish new connections and forge new partnerships, noting the SAR is home to more than 4,700 startups, with 28 percent founded by overseas entrepreneurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rest assured that our free port status and free trade policy remain unshaken. We are firm in our commitment to the free flow of capital, goods, talent and information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the event, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong stressed that unilateral trade policies and protectionism means that technological cooperation will be more vital than ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we navigate an increasingly complex world with a looming revival of unilateralism and protectionism, it is essential that we continue to harness innovation and embrace collaborative spirit to sustain the competitive edge of the tech-driven economies while pushing the technological boundaries for the well-being of people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the city's strategic location as a gateway between mainland China and global markets, world-class infrastructure and a highly diverse talent pool – all of which, he said, will attract top innovators and investors from around the world.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The commander of the SAR's search and rescue team on Sunday said a consensus has been reached with their mainland counterparts to work together in future missions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's 51-member team returned home from Myanmar on Wednesday after assisting in search and rescue efforts following a devastating 7.9-magnitude earthquake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after a Commercial Radio programme, deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the team, revealed that more than 10 mainland teams, including volunteers, were involved in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese rescue teams have about 300 members. If we have 300 people working together each time, the manpower, equipment and technology, as well as the efficiency, can be improved. We can also be well-organised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheu also recalled the moment when the SAR rescuers found a 52-year-old man alive, after he was was trapped in the rubble for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said local residents and officials in Myanmar cried and clapped their hands after the man was rescued, describing the scene as emotional.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, doctor Axel Siu, who's the Chief of Service (Accident and Emergency) at Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin Hospitals, recalled how the team battled the sweltering heat and swarms of mosquitoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they adjusted their strategy by sending smaller teams of two to three people to scout an area first, before deciding whether more personnel should be deployed there to conserve energy.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials warned on Sunday that air pollution in certain areas of Hong Kong will reach "serious" levels, and urged vulnerable groups of people to reduce outdoor exposure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) explained that the level of suspended particulates has gone up since Saturday night due to a "dusty air stream associated with the northeast monsoon".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 10am Sunday, eight of the department's 18 monitoring stations recorded "very high" pollution levels, just one tier below the most severe "serious" classification in the Air Quality Health Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The eight districts are Eastern, Central and Western, Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Tai Po and North.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD noted that with the monsoon moderating gradually, winds were expected to weaken, hindering the dispersion of pollutants. The pollutant level is likely to remain "relatively high in the following one or two days", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children, the elderly and people with heart or respiratory illnesses were advised to cut down on time spent outside, while employers of outdoor workers were told to assess the risks and take preventive measures to protect the health of their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau said schools should take appropriate measures to safeguard students' health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The northeast monsoon has also brought very dry conditions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point on Sunday morning, the relative humidity fell to 21 percent at the Observatory's Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters. The forecaster said that is the lowest mark ever recorded in April since the relevant monitoring equipment was set up in 1984.

<img alt="Rory McIlroy reacts after holing his putt on the 18th green.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy raced out to the best start the Masters has seen in its 91-year history, with six straight 3s on his scorecard that shot him into the lead on Saturday and left him 18 holes away from that coveted green jacket and the career Grand Slam.
 <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy chipped in for eagle as part of his amazing start. And then he delivered another eagle late in the round as contenders were lining up behind him, a majestic 6-iron to 6 feet on the par-5 15th hole that carried him to a second straight 6-under 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was an awesome day and puts me in a great position going into tomorrow,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He led by two shots over a familiar foe — Bryson DeChambeau, who delivered some magic of his own with a 45-foot birdie putt to start his round and a putt from nearly 50 feet for birdie on the 18th hole that gave him a 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was DeChambeau who crushed McIlroy’s spirit last year at Pinehurst No. 2 by beating him at the US Open, stretching McIlroy's drought in the majors to more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also familiar to McIlroy was his position going into the final day at Augusta National .
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 14 years ago when McIlroy, a 21-year-old with long, curly locks and unlimited potential, took a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters. What followed was a meltdown that left him in tears when he shot 80.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I just have to stay firm and just stay in my own little world,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't had a better chance at that green jacket until this week, when he recovered from two double bogeys in the opening round and responded with rounds of 66-66.
  <br>
  <br>
  At stake on Sunday is a chance to become only the sixth player to capture all four professional majors, a feat last accomplished nearly 25 years ago by Tiger Woods at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners, who went from a five-shot deficit to one shot behind McIlroy in a span of three holes on this wild Saturday, closed with eight straight pars for a 70. He was in third place, four shots behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one else was closer than six shots of McIlroy. Justin Rose, who had a one-shot lead at the start of the day, shot 75 and was seven shots back. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States wants a nuclear agreement "as soon as possible", Iran said after rare talks on Saturday, as US President Donald Trump threatens military action if they fail to reach a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who briefly spoke face-to-face with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff during the indirect meeting in Oman, said the talks would resume next Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The American side also said that a positive agreement was one that can be reached as soon as possible but that will not be easy and will require a willingness on both sides," Araghchi told Iranian state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At today's meeting, I think we came very close to a basis for negotiation... Neither we nor the other party want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on for ever," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the White House said: "The discussions were very positive and constructive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oman's foreign minister acted as intermediary in the talks in Muscat, Iran said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the negotiators also spoke directly for "a few minutes", Iran's foreign ministry said. It said the talks were held "in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere".
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-term adversaries, who have not had diplomatic relations for more than 40 years, are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Araghchi, a seasoned diplomat and key architect of the 2015 accord, and Witkoff, a real estate magnate, led the delegations in the highest-level Iran-US nuclear talks since the previous accord's collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties were in "separate halls" and "conveying their views and positions to each other through the Omani foreign minister", Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process took place in a "friendly atmosphere", Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, weakened by Israel's pummelling of its allies Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the United States, hand-in-glove with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, wants to stop Tehran from ever getting close to developing a nuclear bomb.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no visible signs of the high-level meeting at a luxury hotel in Muscat, the same venue where the 2015 agreement was struck when Barack Obama was US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal earlier that the US position starts with demanding that Iran completely dismantle its nuclear programme -- a view held by hardliners around Trump that few expect Iran to accept.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries," Witkoff told the newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponisation of your nuclear capability," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks were revealed in a surprise announcement by Trump during a White House appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the talks began, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country. But they can't have a nuclear weapon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iran sought "a real and fair agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's meetings followed repeated threats of military action by both the United States and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it requires military, we're going to have military," Trump said Wednesday when asked what would happen if the talks fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 deal that Trump abandoned aimed to make it practically impossible for Iran to build an atomic weapon, while at the same time allowing it to pursue a civil nuclear programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which insists its nuclear programme is only for civilian purposes, stepped up its activities after Trump withdrew from the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest International Atomic Energy Agency report said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilograms of uranium enriched to 60 percent, nearing the weapons grade of 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karim Bitar, a Middle East Studies lecturer at Sciences Po university in Paris, said the Iranian government's very survival could be at stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The one and only priority is the survival of the regime, and ideally, to get some oxygen, some sanctions relief, to get their economy going again, because the regime has become quite unpopular," he told AFP.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrated pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix, his 50th Formula One race, while dejected championship-leading teammate Lando Norris qualified sixth and said he had been "clueless on track".
 <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes rival George Russell was second fastest at the floodlit Sakhir desert circuit but was then handed a one-place grid drop, promoting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to the front row instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli collected a similar penalty, after Mercedes released their drivers too early from a red flag stoppage, and dropped to fifth while Alpine's Pierre Gasly moved up to fourth on the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've felt confident out there pretty much all weekend," said Piastri, who was also fastest in two out of three practice sessions and lapped with a best time of one minute 29.841 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Piastri, winner in China from pole, could become the first double winner of the season and looks set to slash the 13-point gap to Norris, who is only one clear of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said the Australian deserved his pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is amazing, as good as it has been all season which is strong. Just I have been off it all weekend," Norris told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why, just clueless on track at the minute. Just not quick enough, simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The only positive for Norris was having Verstappen end up in seventh place for Red Bull at a track where the four-times champion was utterly dominant last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he had been struggling with the brakes and lack of grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea where we will be in terms of race pace. We'll be in the middle of the pack so hopefully a bit of excitement," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Sainz qualified eighth for Williams, at a track where he was quickest in pre-season testing, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton ninth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time this season that both Red Bulls had reached the top 10 shootout, although they flirted with an early exit in Q1 and Q2 when they left it until the last minute to set a time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously as a driver you want more but considering what I had in practice, and it’s only my second race (for Red Bull), I’ll still take it," said Tsunoda, who replaced Liam Lawson after the opening two races.
  <br>
  <br>
  Esteban Ocon crashed his Haas in the second phase, triggering red flags after he careered backwards across the gravel into the barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman took his time clambering out and was taken away in the medical car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian rookie Jack Doohan qualified his Alpine 11th, his best session yet, and one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Albon failed to make it through the opening phase for the first time this season, the Williams driver qualifying only 16th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albon was then promoted to 15th when Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits while already taking part in a second phase he was then excluded from.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards said they had been informed of the violation too late to stop him progressing at Albon's expense.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hadjar's teammate Lawson had another difficult evening and was only 17th. (Reuters)

 US President Donald Trump's administration has granted exclusions from steep reciprocal tariffs to smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a notice to shippers, the US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes. The exclusions are retroactive to 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US CBP listed 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays. The notice did not provide an explanation for the move, but the late-night exclusion provides welcome relief to major technology firms such as Apple, Dell Technologies and many other importers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. (Reuters, AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin De Bruyne sparked Manchester City’s remarkable fightback from two goals down in a 5-2 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday that re-ignited his team’s Champions League qualification hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old De Bruyne curled a free kick in off the post to begin the comeback in the 33rd minute and had a hand in goals by Omar Marmoush and Mateo Kovacic in the first half. James McAtee added a fourth, off a pass from goalkeeper Ederson, who later came off injured before fellow academy product Nico O’Reilly wrapped up the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a display showing the enduring quality of De Bruyne, who announced last week he would be leaving City at the end of the season after 10 years at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injuries have affected the Belgium playmaker's impact in recent seasons but his class can still shine through, with his assist for Kovacic the 119th of his Premier League career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eberechi Eze and Chris Richards scored in the first 21 minutes for Palace to shock City into action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory lifted City into fourth place above Chelsea and Newcastle, who have games in hand in the race to secure England's five Champions League spots. (AP)

 The United States and Iran opened high-stakes talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Saturday, with President Donald Trump threatening military action if they fail to produce a deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides entered "indirect" talks -- via an intermediary -- in the Omani capital Muscat, Iran's foreign ministry said. The Americans had called for the meetings to be face-to-face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disagreement over the format indicated the task facing the long-term adversaries, who are seeking a new nuclear deal after Trump pulled out of an earlier agreement during his first term in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was leading the Iranian delegation while Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff headed the US team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our intention is to reach a fair and honourable agreement from an equal position," Araghchi said in a video posted by Iranian state TV.

 At least 69 people were killed this week in unusually intense thunderstorms across eastern India's Bihar state and in neighbouring Nepal, officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bihar disaster authorities said at least 61 people had died in strong thunder and lightning storms on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more people were killed in neighbouring Nepal, disaster officials said, blaming "lightning strikes" on Wednesday and Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rain was forecast to hit Bihar again on Saturday, according to the local India Meteorological Department office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, experts warned that climate change was fuelling an alarming increase in deadly lightning strikes in India, killing nearly 1,900 people a year in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lightning caused 101,309 deaths between 1967 and 2020, with a sharp increase between 2010 and 2020, a team of researchers led by Fakir Mohan University in the eastern state of Odisha said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sweeping cold front has brought fierce winds across northern China, prompting widespread weather warnings, transport suspensions and emergency response measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Meteorological Center (NMC) on Saturday renewed an alert for strong gales that were expected to sweep the country's northern and coastal regions over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure public safety, Beijing temporarily shut 15 overground railway sections, affecting a total of 106 stations and over 200 kilometres of tracks. Numerous parks and museums were closed, including the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and Beihai Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 10 am on Saturday, a total of 288 trees were toppled across the city due to the strong winds, damaging 19 vehicles, according to Beijing's emergency management authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's airports cancelled hundreds of flights scheduled for Saturday, and a humanoid-robot half marathon that was set to take place on Sunday was postponed to April 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  No injuries or fatalities related to the extreme winds were reported in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  In northern Shanxi Province, the State Grid branch deployed over 3,000 personnel to inspect and reinforce electrical facilities. Emergency repair teams and mobile generators were positioned across the province in advance to ensure rapid power restoration in the event of outages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, strong winds disrupted rail, road and air traffic. (Xinhua)

 China is committed to safeguarding an open, inclusive, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has told Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a video call, the pair exchanged views on issues such as responding to the so-called "reciprocal tariffs" imposed by the United States, maintaining the multilateral trading system, and giving play to the role of the WTO, according to a statement released by the Commerce Ministry on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the fabrication of "reciprocal tariffs" out of thin air by the United States is a typical practice of unilateral bullying and these tariffs will inflict serious harm on developing countries, especially the least developed nations, and could even trigger humanitarian crises.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on WTO members to unite and counter unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying practices through openness, cooperation, and multilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Okonjo-Iweala said that escalating trade tensions have posed serious challenges to global trade and economic growth prospects and WTO members should work together to defend an open, rules-based multilateral trading system, resolving differences through dialogue and cooperation under the WTO framework.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Immigration Benson Kwok says more officers will be deployed to verify documents submitted as part of Top Talent Pass Scheme applications, following reports of false information being provided on occasions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will look into each case very carefully. Since June last year, we have been carrying out verification procedures for applicants' academic qualifications," he told reporters on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If verification procedures have not been carried out before, they will be conducted when applicants renew their pass."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kwok also said national security risks persist in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Immigration Department will not lower its guard, and it will make coordination actively on the implementation of the national security legislation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The department will continue to safeguard the southern gateway to our country and comprehensively block those who endanger national security from entering Hong Kong."

    Weather forces suspension of water splashing event

 The weather put a dampener on a water splashing festival in Kowloon City to celebrate Songkran on Saturday afternoon, with organisers forced to suspend the event when a thunderstorm warning was issued.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Water Splashing with Electronic Music" festival was part of a campaign to enhance Hong Kong's day and nighttime vibrancy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rizwan Ullah, a member of Kowloon City District Council which co-organised the event, said there was no problem with a little rain, but the threat of a storm posed safety fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the rain, it makes you feel more like in Bangkok or in Thailand, celebrating Songkran. I mean with rain it's perfectly okay, no problem. But the problem is with thunder," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because if you are government organising an event like this with thunder, you have that responsibility to ensure public safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man who said he has been going to the festival for many years was disappointed with the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand that it should be suspended due to the thunderstorm warning, but I hope it can be resumed soon. The atmosphere is not as good as before," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Shanghai said while water splashing was the highlight of the festival, he still enjoyed the food on offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This festival is still special because there are Thai New Year celebrations in Hong Kong. The atmosphere is quite good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival was slated to continue at Carpenter Road Park Basketball Courts on Sunday.

 Pan Yundong, deputy commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, has called for all sectors to leverage the SAR's advantages in telling good stories about Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event on Friday, Pan said Beijing is committed to becoming a source of stability as the world undergoes unprecedented changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted how Chinese cultural appeal had resonated worldwide, and urged all sectors to showcase the nation's credible, lovable, and respectable image.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Hong Kong transitions from stability to prosperity, Pan said the SAR government is implementing reforms with strong central government backing. He hopes everyone will adopt the can-do attitude known as the "Lion Rock Spirit".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also noted how new technologies like AI and big data are changing how people communicate. He said Hongkongers should embrace these changes, while helping shape a positive narrative for the city and the nation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed police commissioner Joe Chow on Saturday said officers will work more closely with police in other jurisdictions to combat cross-border scams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Chow said it's becoming increasingly difficult to fight scams because many fraudsters or syndicates operate from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been working alongside other law enforcement agencies overseas, especially through the Interpol channel," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have two officers seconded over there in Singapore, the Singapore office of the Interpol. So on a day-to-day basis, we also continue this kind of collaboration work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Locally, Chow said many scams involve stooge accounts, and police will focus on catching those who sell them.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, police arrested 139 alleged stooge account holders on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said national security threats are still in place despite the SAR being generally stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said some people are using social media platforms to incite anti-government sentiment, and some shops have been printing seditious messages on receipts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soft resistance has never been stopped," he said. "So we have to work harder and harder, and at the same time, we would like to enhance the national security awareness of  the whole community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also highlighted the use of new technology in police operations, such as plans to utilise drones in patrolling in both urban and rural areas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn says one or two sizeable Northern Metropolis land parcels should to be put up for tender this year, while one in the San Tin Technopole will be tendered in 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has received 22 submissions expressing interest to develop the three pilot areas of large-scale land disposal located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Linn said the submissions were made by property developers, contractors, conglomerates and logistic companies. She said 60 percent were local companies, and the others were from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect to see some output in the next two years, including building or formation works. These can be rolled out gradually," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We normally give developers six to seven years in total, although there were opinions that the time was insufficient. We have to strike a balance because we want to speed up development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn added that the government will not rule out using a "two-envelope approach" for the tenders, which means non-premium factors will be considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Development Bureau launched a two-year pilot scheme to relax the restrictions under land leases on public spaces of shopping malls, giving them more flexibility to host activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the scheme aims to boost the economy by encouraging shopping malls to make better use of their public spaces.

 Argentina dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso on Friday as it sealed a US$20 billion, 48-month Extended Fund Facility deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 <br>
  <br>
  The IMF deal lays out an immediate disbursement US$12 billion, and a first review is planned for June with an associated additional disbursement of some US$2 billion, the IMF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South American nation's central bank announced that it will undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina will eliminate major parts of the so-called "cepo" capital controls that have restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies from this year will also be able to repatriate profits out of the country, a key demand from businesses that could unlock more investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of Monday, we will be able to put an end to the foreign exchange restrictions which were imposed in 2019 and which limit the normal functioning of the economy," Economy Ministry Luis Caputo said at a press conference.  (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A man facing the death penalty for committing two murders was executed by firing squad on Friday, the second such execution in the US state of South Carolina this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Mahdi, 42, was executed for the 2004 murder of 56-year-old James Myers, an off-duty police officer, and the murder of a convenience store employee three days earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement from the prison, "the execution was performed by a three-person firing squad at 6:01 pm (2201 GMT)," with Mahdi pronounced dead four minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad -- a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society," defence lawyer David Weiss said in a statement. "Mikal died in full view of a system that failed him at every turn -- from childhood to his final breath."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myers found Mahdi hiding in a garden shed at his home before Mahdi killed him and set the body on fire. Mahdi also pleaded guilty to murdering a convenience store clerk three days before he killed Myers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Carolina gives its death row inmates a choice between lethal injection, the electric chair and the firing squad. Mahdi chose the firing squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first execution by firing squad in the United States in 15 years was carried out in South Carolina on March 7, when a man convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend's parents was put to death.
  <br>
  <br>
  A three-person squad of Department of Corrections volunteers opens fire on the condemned man, who is restrained in a chair with a hood over his head 15 feet (five meters) away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi had requested clemency from Governor Henry McMaster but South Carolina's Republican chief executive did not grant it, or any previous clemency petitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's lawyers had argued that he had suffered his entire life. He was four when his mother fled her abusive husband, leaving the boy to be raised by his volatile mentally ill father, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between the ages of 14 and 21, Mikal spent over 80 percent of his life in prison and lived through 8,000 hours in solitary confinement," his lawyers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They described Mahdi as "deeply remorseful and a dramatically different person from the confused, angry and abused youth who committed the capital crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahdi's execution was the 12th in the United States this year. There were 25 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of US executions since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have been performed using lethal injection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alabama has carried out four executions using nitrogen gas, a method that has been denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others -- California, Oregon and Pennsylvania -- have moratoriums in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump is a proponent of capital punishment and on his first day in office called for an expansion of its use "for the vilest crimes."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the US military base in Greenland, a Danish territory coveted by US President Donald Trump, has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island.
 <br>
  <br>
  Colonel Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik Space Base since July, was removed after reports she distanced herself and the base from US Vice President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory during his visit two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties," the US Space Force said in a statement late Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not expand further, but US website Military.com said Meyers sent a March 31 email to all personnel at Pituffik "seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there" following Vance's appearance."
  <br>
  <br>
  During his March 28 visit to the base, Vance told a press conference, "Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Nuuk and Copenhagen viewed the visit as a provocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on social media, "We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a Facebook post that "the United States will not get Greenland. We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future."
  <br>
  <br>
  In her email, relayed to Military.com, Meyers wrote, "I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base."
  <br>
  <br>
  On X, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said, "Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meyers has been replaced by Colonel Shawn Lee, the US Space Force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted that Washington needs control of Greenland for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it, causing tensions to soar between the United States and Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen traveled to Greenland last week, telling the United States that "you cannot annex another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls show a vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the United States. (AFP)

    Trump takes annual physical exam, says it went well

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800043_1_20250412093003.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump, who in January became the oldest person to assume the US presidency, underwent his first physical exam of his second term on Friday and said it went well, with results set to be released Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who turns 79 in June and likes fast food so much he staged a photo op at a McDonald's during his campaign last year, spent several hours being poked and prodded by the doctors at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went, I think, well ... every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. "I think I did well. I think they're releasing the report on Sunday," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he took a cognitive exam and got all the answers right.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall I felt I was in very good shape. A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul and I took — I wanted to be a little different than Biden. I took a cognitive test and I don't know what to tell you other than I got every answer right," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The physical could offer the first clear look at Trump's condition since his ear was grazed by a bullet in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign released a report by Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor and a Republican Congressman from Texas, saying the injuries were superficial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House typically determines what data will be released from a president's health exam and earlier in the day Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said results will be released as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump is not compelled to release any information, and there is no template for the presidential exam. Trump released only limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 election, Trump drew sharp contrasts with his predecessor, Joe Biden, now 82, claiming he was younger and fitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House doctor in 2018, when Trump was serving his first term, said the president was in overall excellent health but needed to shed weight and start a daily exercise routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked on Friday if the medical team had suggested any changes to his habits, the president said that they had "a little bit", but did not elaborate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump included a cognitive exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, as part of his physical during his first term, and his doctor later said he scored 30 out of 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden released detailed summaries of his physical exams while in office, but several books published in recent months have raised questions about his mental acuity in his final months in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mental ability and age of both Biden and Trump were in focus during last year's election campaign, especially after Biden's disastrous performance in a debate with Trump in June, and Trump's increasingly rambling speeches at rallies. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Rose remained atop a star-studded leaderboard after the second round of the Masters on Friday , with defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau all within three shots of the lead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rose followed his opening 65 with a 1-under 71 that left him 8 under for the tournament. He was one ahead of DeChambeau , the reigning US Open champion, whose rounds of 69-68 have him firmly in the mix for his first green jacket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking of first green jackets, McIlroy is in good shape to finally get his own. He had the low round of the day, a 6-under 66 to get to 6 under for the tournament. McIlroy needs only the Masters to complete the career grand slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners also was at 6 under, and Scheffler was in a group another shot back that included Shane Lowry, Matt McCarty and Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler dropped a shot at the par-4 finishing hole, which played the toughest on the course Friday. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Friday, concluding a rollercoaster week on a positive note amid hopes that the market has absorbed the worst headlines about trade conflicts.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities shrugged off early weakness after China announced 125 percent tariffs on US goods in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that escalation, traders hope "that we're going to pivot from the phase of escalation to negotiation and hopefully further down the road to de-escalation," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potentially "a lot of bad news is in the price already," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,353.36, up 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 1.6 percent to 40,212.71, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.1 percent to 16,724,46.
  <br>
  <br>
  US equities this week have gyrated as markets digest President Trump's shifting announcements on tariffs and the evolving stance of other parties, including the European Union, which unveiled and then paused countermeasures earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, economists point to a rising risk of a US recession amid worries about inflation. On Friday, a survey from the University of Michigan noted a sharp drop in consumer confidence, and flagged a worrying rise in both short-term and longer-term inflation expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are also turning attention to quarterly earnings season, which began in earnest on Friday with large banks and financial players.
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan Chase surged 4.0 percent following better than expected results, while BlackRock gained 2.3 percent and Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo lost 1.0 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Friday welcomed the High Court’s decision to dismiss a legal challenge against the environmental impact assessment of the San Tin Technopole project.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling removes uncertainties surrounding the project, and that authorities will “press ahead with this flagship project of the Northern Metropolis”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court’s decision came after the applicant withdrew his judicial review application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justice Russell Coleman allowed social worker Eddie Tse to drop his case and rejected a request to have former Sai Kung district councillor Debby Chan take over the proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coleman shot down the request in a written judgement, saying Tse and Chan did not share sufficient common interests beyond a general concern for environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ruled that Chan only expressed interest in the case "after she learnt from the applicant that he had decided to withdraw his own challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing for the judicial review in June has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Department also welcomed the ruling, saying it will continue to strictly review all environmental impact assessment reports according to statutory requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than HK$27 billion and nearly 300 hectares of land have been earmarked for the innovation and technology hub in San Tin.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of Israeli air strikes on Gaza have killed "only women and children" after a ceasefire collapsed, the UN said, as an Israeli attack in the territory's south on Friday left a family of 10 dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  A UN rights office report also warned that expanding Israeli evacuation orders were resulting in the "forcible transfer" of people into ever-shrinking areas, raising "real concern as to the future viability of Palestinians as a group in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it was looking into the attack that killed members of the same family in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, adding separately that it had struck about 40 "terror targets" across the territory over the past day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed its Gaza strikes on March 18, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, more than 1,500 people have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory to which Israel cut off aid more than a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten people, including seven children, were brought to the hospital as martyrs following an Israeli air strike that targeted the Farra family home in central Khan Yunis," civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced Israel, saying: "If this is not barbarism, I ask you, what is it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  And the UN decried the impact of the ongoing Israeli strikes, finding that "a large percentage of fatalities are children and women". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian non-permanent judge Robert French has stepped down from the Court of Final Appeal, with the government on Friday expressing regret over his resignation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration also extended its gratitude to the departing judge and issued assurances that the SAR's judicial work would not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The presence or absence of individual judges will not undermine the integrity of the system, nor impair the [Hong Kong SAR] government's determination in upholding the rule of law," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Hong Kong SAR] government fully supports the judiciary in its continuous efforts to appoint and retain foreign non-permanent judges in the future, and will endeavour to capitalise on the [Hong Kong SAR's] common law system, upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Confirming French's departure, the judiciary said he had "affirmed his continued respect for the independence and integrity" of all judges at Hong Kong's top court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary is grateful to Mr Justice French for his valuable contributions to the work of the [Court of Final Appeal] and his support for the rule of law in Hong Kong during his tenure," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French, who previously served as the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, joined the top court as a non-permanent judge in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following his exit, there are nine non-permanent judges sitting on the Court of Final Appeal. Five of them are from the United Kingdom and Australia.

  "In light of its steady caseload, the operation of the [Court of Final Appeal] will not be affected by the recent change in membership of the court," the judiciary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judiciary will continue to identify suitable local and overseas candidates for appointment as non-permanent judges."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bar Association has expressed regret over French’s resignation, adding that it is grateful for his contributions to the development of jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted his departure will not affect the court's judicial functions, and said that it has “every confidence in the independence of the [Court of Final Appeal]”.

 A subway tunnel under construction near Seoul collapsed on Friday, likely leaving two workers trapped at the site, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said authorities were mobilising 55 rescue workers and 18 vehicles to rescue possible victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at Gwangmyeong, a city just south of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's officials said authorities earlier withdrew workers from the construction site and stopped traffic around the area after receiving reports that a ventilation shaft at the site was at a risk of collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The officials said it wasn't immediately known whether any workers re-entered the site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top EU officials and Chinese leaders are due to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, a spokesperson for the European Council said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had announced plans for a summit in January, before US President Donald Trump took office and unleashed swingeing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are coordinating with China to set a date for the meeting, which is expected to take place in China in the second half of July," said the official at the council, the body representing the EU's 27 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc faces a delicate balancing act, seeking to negotiate with an unpredictable ally in Washington to avoid tariffs and the need to diversify trading partners, with its bid to hold the line on its own trade concerns regarding China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Friday, President Xi Jinping urged the EU to join hands with Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying", referring to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of the EU's two main institutions – the council and the European Commission – have held regular summits with China's leadership. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Friday the government will further review operations at RTHK after lawmakers expressed concern over the broadcaster's expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a special finance committee meeting on the budget in the legislature, lawmakers raised questions over the station's headcount and spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho noted that the broadcaster's forecast budget for this financial year had been set at HK$1.5 billion, around 50 percent more than that of five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the station cannot keep asking for more public money when the government is under financial stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go back to review once again the overall operations of RTHK, its production and manpower arrangements," Yau said in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK is under the purview of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip noted the broadcaster is cutting four positions from its 750-strong workforce this financial year, and questioned if it could cut more jobs at the programme officer level in the TV section, since three of its five TV channels are relays of state television or broadcast acquired programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Angelina Kwan said the streamlining will continue, and proposals will be submitted to the bureau later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan added that RTHK has been purchasing outside programmes to provide more diverse content.

<img alt="Mohamed Salah says the prospect of winning before a full Enfield is what drives him crazy every day. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799966_1_20250411175726.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah said he is driven every day to deliver Premier League glory to Liverpool this season after signing a new two-year contract on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah, 32, has defied the distraction of months of speculation over his future by scoring 27 goals and providing 17 assists in the 31 league appearances to help open up an 11-point lead at the top of the table with seven games to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian was part of the Liverpool side that delivered the club's first league title for 30 years in the 2019/20 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Covid restrictions meant that the Reds lifted the trophy in front of an empty Anfield and there was no parade through the city's streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I said in the beginning of the season, I just want to win the Premier League more than anything else," Salah told Liverpool's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want it so bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we owe that to the fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They deserve it, they deserve to enjoy it after that long time, with celebrating at Anfield and in the street and just enjoying ourselves winning the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said "that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said news of Salah's new deal may have come as a "pleasant surprise" for supporters but praised the club's sporting director Richard Hughes for ensuring the Egyptian remains at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer, of course, that things were heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend Mo Salah, who is such a great player as a free agent, that he can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he stayed at our club and that's also a compliment for Richard." (AFP)

    Yoon in emotional exit from official residence

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol returned to his private home on Friday from the official residence after his removal from office, with crowds of supporters turning out to greet his motorcade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court upheld Yoon's impeachment last Friday, capping four months of unprecedented constitutional turmoil after his short-lived attempt to impose martial law in December sent shockwaves through Asia's fourth-largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will now hold a snap election on June 3, and questions remain over whether Yoon might still play a role given how his impeachment appears to have deepened polarisation in society and stirred up his conservative supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds had gathered outside the gates of the official residence, where Yoon briefly stopped to hug and shake hands with supporters, some of whom were crying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president has not been seen in public since he was released from prison on March 8 when a court cancelled his detention warrant in the criminal case against him. He did not attend the impeachment ruling by the Constitutional Court on April 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of his ruling party members and supporters have been seen visiting the official residence where Yoon reportedly discussed the upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he left the official residence, Yoon donned a red baseball cap saying "Make Korea Great Again" given to him by a supporter, video footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now I will go back to being one of the people... and find a new way for the country and the people," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his wife were driven in a motorcade from the official presidential residence to their private apartment in a 37-storey building in Seoul. The pet-loving couple will also take back more than 10 dogs and cats they own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 280 police were deployed around his private home on Friday ahead of the move, and Yoon is to be accompanied by a security detail of about 50 people, media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president still faces trial on a criminal charge of leading an insurrection, which is punishable by death or a life sentence if he is convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race to replace Yoon kicked off this week with nearly 20 hopefuls expected to contest for the candidacy of the conservative People Power Party that is in a fight to retain the presidency against a populist liberal who leads in the polls. (Reuters)

    Warning system in works for HK's flood-prone roads

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday announced a pilot scheme to install flood-warning systems at five flood-prone areas to prevent vehicles from being stranded during severe rainstorms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Wading Line System will be set up at Chai Wan Road, Lung Cheung Road in Wong Tai Sin, Tsui Ping Road in Kwun Tong, Chatham Road North in Ho Man Tin and Nam Wan Road in Tai Po Market.
  <br>
  <br>
  These five low-lying road sections were heavily flooded during what were described as "once-in-500-years" deluges in September 2023, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system comes with red wavy lines painted on roads, water level markers and real-time monitoring equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drainage officials will also install flood-monitoring devices at the lowest points of the road sections to collect real-time water level data.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the water level reaches 0.1 metres, staff from the Drainage Services and Highways departments will be deployed to clear blocked drains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic will be diverted on site when the water level reaches 0.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If water rises above this level, it can seriously damage vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officials get a flood warning, they will send teams to the site within 15 to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With installation work starting in late April and expected to be completed by mid-May, the five pilot projects cost around HK$700,000, a government spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials will examine the scheme's effectiveness before deciding on the next step.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US dollar tumbled along with most stocks while gold hit a fresh record high as panic gripped markets again on Friday, while China retaliated against Donald Trump's latest tariff blitz against the world's number two economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing raised the tariffs on US imports to 125 percent near the end of trading in stocks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.13 percent to close at 20,914.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.74 percent to end at 7,801.51 while the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8 percent to end at 4,900.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president's decision to delay crippling duties for 90 days sparked a frenzied scramble for equities that had been beaten down since his "Liberation Day" announcement unleashed a global panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the realisation that nothing had been resolved, coupled with Trump's decision to double down on his battle with economic superpower China, fuelled another bout of selling of US assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The greenback tanked against the yen, euro, pound and Swiss franc – investors dropping what is usually considered a key safe haven currency as they look to unload US risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold-standard Treasuries were also under pressure amid speculation that China was offloading some of its vast holdings in retaliation for Trump's measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weaker dollar and the rush for safety has also sent bullion to a fresh record high above US$3,220.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Beijing's latest tariffs move made in response to Trump, President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying" by Washington, state media said as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, Beijing said it would ramp up levies against the United States to 125 percent, compared with the 145 percent China faces.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Washington's moves defied "basic economic laws and common sense" and "seriously violates international trade rules" but said it would "ignore" future US hikes.

  <br>
  Markets across the region were back deep in negative territory at the end of a highly volatile week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo shed 3 percent – a day after surging more than 9 percent – while Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington and Bangkok were also in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.
  <br>

  Beijing said earlier in the day that it would implement a moderately loose monetary policy in a bid to reassure investors. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged the European Union on Friday to join hands with China in resisting "unilateral bullying", in reference to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi stressed the need for cooperation between the bloc and Beijing in weathering Trump's continual escalations in the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, he stressed, would not only "safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sanchez also said "we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain buys about 45 billion euros of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez's trip comes as the EU rethinks its global trading relationships in the face of turmoil caused by the US import duties announced last week that have sent world markets into a tailspin.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a "numbers game" that "will become a joke", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement followed the US move to raise the "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's duties on Chinese products have "become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries. (Xinhua/AP)

 Police said on Friday 139 people have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and obtaining property by deception, with losses to victims amounting to more than HK$130 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspects, aged between 19 and 73, provided syndicates with stooge accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspects were said to be involved in phone, investment and online scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior inspector Wong Yuen-yan said the Kowloon West saw about 1,700 scams in the first quarter, 10 percent more than in the same period of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the police will continue to crack down on syndicates and stooge account holders.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman said on Friday it’s launching an investigation into how the Highways Department handles damage to roads, such as uneven surfaces and potholes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog added that it has also received public complaints about the department’s ineffective monitoring of contractors and delays to repair work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ombudsman Jack Chan said it’s essential for the department to ensure roads are safe and convenient for public use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Moreover, as sudden and exceptionally severe rainstorms brought about by extreme weather have happened from time to time in recent years, road closures due to subsidence and serious flooding also take place now and then,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this light, I have decided to launch a direct investigation operation to examine the Highways Department 's work on the repair and maintenance of public roads.”
  <br>
  <br>
  People are being invited to put forward any views they have on the matter by May 11.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the government has come up with strategies to tackle an expected drop in Hong Kong's global trading volume as a result of the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan told Ming Pao newspaper that the trade war has brought continued uncertainty to the logistics, maritime and aviation sectors in Hong Kong, and the government will take a leading role by offering them more concrete guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the strategies is to help the maritime sector look for new growth areas and set up new markets outside Europe and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the bureau will be more proactive in attracting shipments to the SAR by stepping up collaboration with ports in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus, the transport minister said, is to deepen exchanges and cooperation with international ports and shippers in an attempt to expand the SAR's maritime network, and in that regard an office will be set up in the Middle East in the second half to get more ships to be registered here.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is also considering streamlining customs procedures to boost transshipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the aviation industry, Chan highlighted the need for the sector to upgrade and transform itself by offering diversified services.

    Trump levy looms larger for senders of small parcels

<img alt="People sending small parcels to the US will have to pay US$100 per item from May 2 and US$200 from June 1.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is continuing to see fallout from the trade war started by US President Donald Trump who raised the duty on small goods parcels from the SAR to 120 percent from the 90 percent that he had set just a day before that, and the 30 percent in his opening salvo on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the amendment in an executive order that went public on Thursday Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tariffs on parcels will go up from US$75 to US$100 from May 2 and from US$150 to US$200 from June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in tariffs closes a trade exemption rule known de minimis that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to enter the United States free of duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  It means people wanting to send small parcels worth up to US$800, which are currently exempt from any duties, to the US from the mainland, Hong Kong or Macau will now have to pay US$100 per item posted between May 2 and before June 1 and US$200 for goods sent after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The skyrocketing increase in duties comes as the number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of these packages now enter under the de minimis rule, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in duties on small goods parcels has been framed by Trump as a solution to the national emergency arising from the US trade deficits and in his starting a tit-for-tat trade war that has seen him levy a punitive 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has said no one wins in a trade war and described the tariffs as protectionist.

 Commerce minister Algernon Yau on Friday said the chief executive would head to the Middle East next month with representatives from mainland enterprises to seek more business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yau made the announcement during the legislature's special finance committee meeting on the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DAB's Starry Lee, who's also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, asked how the SAR government planned to reduce its reliance on the US market amid the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed to the fact that Beijing had tasked Hong Kong with strengthening its global connections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau replied that officials like himself have been to different countries seeking new partnerships, and John Lee would also do so next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In May, the CE will visit the Middle East together with [those from] mainland enterprises. So amid the geo-political tensions, we seek to further development in new markets in the Middle East as well as Asean," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the 10 Asean countries, I've been to seven of them. Mr Lee has also led delegations to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. You can see the SAR government has been working proactively to connect with the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Import and export sector lawmaker, Kennedy Wong from the DAB, asked whether the government plans to move some of its Economic and Trade Offices from Europe and the United States to new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that his bureau had been making plans to move some of the offices around, and it would submit its proposals later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance and industrial sector lawmaker, Jimmy Ng, meanwhile, asked for a direct communication channel with officials due to the trade war, saying the sector had been caught off-guard by the ever-changing developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said in response that his bureau had held two recent meetings with the trade, saying the financial secretary could take the lead to liaise with the business sector if needed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner for Digital Policy Tony Wong said Hong Kong aims to launch a locally developed chatbot in the second half and that it may be available for use free of charge in the initial stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center is developing local large language models, and its generative AI document processing application HKPilot has been used by government departments since last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Wong said he hopes the application can improve work efficiency and, in the long run, replace traditional jobs that require a lot of manpower.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects HKChat's launch in the second half to bring great convenience to the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, Hong Kong residents may want to apply for some government services and they may not know where to find the services or what the procedures are," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because the chatbot is trained with data from Hong Kong and we provided it with a lot of information, it will answer you in detail the things you have to prepare and the procedures when applying for the services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong was speaking ahead of the annual World Internet Conference's Asia-Pacific summit at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday and Tuesday, the first time it is being hosted in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the summit to attract more than 1,000 officials and business representatives from around the world, like the Six Little Dragons from Hangzhou which include DeepSeek and Unitree Robotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes Hong Kong can make use of its advantage of being connected with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can demonstrate our strength in innovation and technology to the outside world through Hong Kong and seek more room for its development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The World Internet Conference uses Asia-Pacific summit as its theme, hoping to connect different countries in the Asia-Pacific region and paying special attention to the development of emerging markets in the Global South."
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said the authorities will go all out in making a success of the summit and hope it can be hosted in Hong Kong again next year.

<img alt="Paul Chan says the SAR government has formulated various response plans to help fend off financial risks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799904_1_20250411111509.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibits and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

<img alt="Lawmaker Kennedy Wong says having a diversified set of trading partners will be increasingly important for Hong Kong firms.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong on Friday said the world had entered a new period of uncertainty and disruption because of the US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two goals from Ulrik Saltnes spurred Bodo/Glimt to a 2-0 home victory over Lazio in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lazio arrived on Thursday in a windy Bodo to find snow had blanketed the pitch in the early hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the artificial turf was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to the challenging zero-degree conditions in northern Norway, spending much of the match pinned back and on the defensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European Cup semi-final, Bodo/Glimt neutralised Lazio's defence, attacking the box time and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Lazio registered just a single shot on target throughout the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am incredibly pleased with a lot but I do not think we should get carried away," Bodo/Glimt coach Kjetil Knutsen told Viaplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a clear identity and an incredible strength within us. We should be happy with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts seized early control, with Jens Petter Hauge firing a clever, short shot in the opening minutes that Lazio keeper Christos Mandas had to stretch to push out of danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the half-hour mark, Bodo/Glimt came close again when Ole Didrik Blomberg received the ball inside the box but it slid off his foot as he prepared his shot and the effort went well wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt made the breakthrough just two minutes after the restart when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise short pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg to give the hosts the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the hosts looked to double their advantage, their sharp, quick passing continued to trouble the Lazio defence but several promising opportunities were squandered as they struggled to convert their finishing touches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt scored their second goal in the 69th minute when Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear it, the ball had already crossed the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lazio back-up keeper made another save in the last seconds from Odin Bjortuft's attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had speed in their exchanges because of the artificial pitch," Lazio manager Marco Baroni told Sky Sport Italia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the second leg will be a different game and qualification is still open."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be next Thursday at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers held Athletic Bilbao to a nail-biting goalless draw at home in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, despite being reduced to 10 men early on.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage on Thursday after Rangers defender Robin Propper was sent off in the 13th minute for a foul on Inaki Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, appearing in the last 16 of a major European competition for the first time since 2015-16, had a couple of clear-cut opportunities in the first half, with both Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet coming close.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, goalkeeper Liam Kelly produced a series of fine saves to keep them at bay as the Scottish Premiership side defended strongly and even threatened when Cyriel Dessers fired wide from long range.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was delayed for seven minutes in the second half due to an injury to 18-year-old Bailey Rice, who was carried off on a stretcher after taking a knock on the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao, who finished second in the league phase, thought they had broken the deadlock when substitute Alex Berenguer scored in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, however, was flagged offside after a VAR review but a penalty was awarded as the ball had bounced off the hand of defender James Tavernier before the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sending-off seemed pretty clear to me. I didn't see the penalty well though, but it seemed a bit strange," Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet at the last moment we lacked clarity and didn't manage to convert the spot kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The draw is not what we wanted considering they played with 10 men and we had chances," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Kelly again emerged as the hero with a crucial save from Berenguer to keep the result scoreless as Bilbao failed to score in a European game for the first time in their last 19 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was a proper Rangers performance," Rangers boss Barry Ferguson told TNT sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the exact reaction I wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's what I spoke about on Monday and the players tonight showed a performance full of heart, grit and determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played on Thursday at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao and the winners will face either Lyon or Manchester United, who drew 2-2 in the first leg, for a place in the final in Bilbao. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks fell on Friday, hurt by growing concerns about the US trade war and the potential for a global recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 124 points, or 0.6 percent, to open at 20,557 points, while the tech sub-index was 0.5 percent weaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index on the mainland and the Shanghai Composite Index were flat, losing just 0.1 percent at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 share index was down 5.6 percent in early trading, while shares also fell in South Korea and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses of US stocks accelerated after the White House clarified that the United States will tax Chinese imports at 145 percent, not the 125 percent rate that Trump had written about in his posting on Truth Social Wednesday. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.

 Recovery efforts wrapped up in the capital of the Dominican Republic after a roof collapse at a nightclub during a concert killed at least 221 people, authorities said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As families continue to mourn their loved ones, the cause of the catastrophe and the exact number of people who attended the fateful event have not yet been determined by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sudden collapse at the Jet Set club in Santo Domingo after midnight on Tuesday marred a concert by merengue singer Rubby Perez where politicians, athletes and other prominent local figures had gathered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today the search, rescue and recovery of victims ended," presidential spokesperson Homero Figueroa said in a video the government posted on social media. "Now it is time to move on to another phase, that of understanding and explaining what happened."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dominican government has approved creating a team of national and international experts to clarify the causes of the roof collapse at the popular venue, Figueroa said in the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency teams, that were on site until Thursday morning, pulled nearly 200 survivors from the building in the hours following the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Manuel Mendez, head of the country's emergency operations center (COE), said, "This is the hardest task I've had in my 20 years of leading the COE," breaking down in tears.
  <br>
  <br>
  After recovery efforts ended, the families of those missing left the area surrounding the nightclub, where they had stood for days embracing each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perez, the singer, was among those killed in the crush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominican President Luis Abinader attended his funeral on Thursday, with a public memorial service for him set to follow later in the day. (Reuters)

<img alt="A display in Tokyo shows stock market declines in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Continuing jitters about US tariffs hit Asian stocks in early trade on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei tumbling more than five percent and gold hitting another record high.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China. Levies on Chinese imports are now at a total of 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, the Nikkei 225 was off 5.4 percent, having soared 9.1 percent on Thursday after Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other markets also handed back many of their gains of the previous day, with the Kospi in Seoul off 1.64 percent and Sydney down more than two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil and the US dollar also slid on fears of a global slowdown in economic activity, while gold hit a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow safe-haven asset the yen also gained 0.9 percent against the dollar on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump maintained a 10 percent blanket tariff on most countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he paused plans for tariffs of 20 percent on the European Union and even higher levies on multiple other trade partners, including 24 percent on Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday that the EU was "very smart" to back off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China even as the bloc's chief warned it could tax US Big Tech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(The EU) were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing." (AFP)

<img alt="Britain's Defence Secretary John Healey and France's Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu attend a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, hosted by the United Kingdom and France at Nato headquarters in Brussels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's defence minister on Thursday urged his counterparts from around 30 countries to press ahead with plans to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia, as questions remained over whether the United States would provide backup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairing the first defence ministers' meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said its members must ensure "that we’re fully prepared for the moment a peace agreement is reached.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must be ready for when that peace comes. That’s why the work of this coalition is so vital," Healey said at Nato headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on social media, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said that “Ukraine is ready for peace - one that is just and backed by strength.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian government officials and military analysts have said that Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in Ukraine in the coming weeks to maximise pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As usual with coalition gatherings, the United States did not take part. The success of the coalition’s operation hinges on US backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, Sweden and Finland underlined the “crucial” role of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, representatives from around 50 nations will gather at Nato to drum up military support for Ukraine. That meeting will be chaired by Britain and Germany. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to join the meeting via video from Washington. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property developer Country Garden said on Friday it had reached an agreement with creditors holding nearly 30 percent of its existing offshore bond debt and was close to finalising terms with another group of bank creditors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposed restructuring covers aggregate outstanding principal amount of US$14.07 billion of its existing debt, Country Garden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had proposed the plan to cut its offshore debt by US$11.6 billion in January. Creditors holding 29.9 percent of US$10.3 billion in bonds had agreed to the plan, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also close to finalising a deal with a lender group made up of seven banks who hold three syndicated loans with an outstanding principal amount of US$3.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate firm has offered five restructuring options to its bondholders including extending the maturity by as much as 11.5 years alongside choosing mandatory convertible bonds and new debt instruments. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump claimed victory over Europe in the US tariffs war but acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China as markets plunged again on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump sought a victory lap at a White House cabinet meeting, saying the European Union had backed off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were very smart. They were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil. "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was upbeat, telling reporters that "I don't see anything unusual today," as he touted better than expected US inflation numbers and other economic indicators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the broad-based S&P 500 finishing down 3.5 percent after soaring 9.5 percent on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.5 percent, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dialling back of the planned global trade war left most of the focus on China, the world's number two economy after the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House on Thursday clarified that levies on Chinese imports are now at a staggering total of 145 percent - not the previously reported 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was because the latest tariff hike comes on top of a 20 percent tariff already imposed earlier. China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union welcomed the US president's partial row-back on his original threat to impose 20 percent tariffs against the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-nation grouping responded with its own olive branch, suspending for 90 days tariffs on 20 billion euros' worth of US goods that had been greenlit in retaliation to duties on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its latest measure, the Commerce Ministry in Beijing announced it would reduce the number of Hollywood films imported, but said it remained ready for dialogue. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people, including three children, were killed after a sightseeing helicopter crashed into the Hudson River in New York on Thursday, sparking a major water rescue operation, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed all those onboard the aircraft: the pilot and a family from Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the victims were initially taken to a hospital, but later succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, all six victims have been removed from the water. And sadly, all six victims have been pronounced deceased," Mayor Eric Adams told a briefing, after earlier calling it a "heartbreaking and tragic crash."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chopper's landing skids were seen protruding from the river beside a tunnel vent as several boats clustered around the impact site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police from both New York and New Jersey, which is on the opposite side of the river from Manhattan, responded to the scene along with fire department vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBC4 channel reported that its own helicopter was unable to take off because of weather conditions, with the weather in New York on Thursday gusty under thick cloud cover.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told the outlet that a rotor blade had come loose from the aircraft, while footage on social media showed pieces of the aircraft breaking off and the helicopter plunging into the waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A Bell 206 helicopter crashed and is submerged in the Hudson River in New York City," the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.

  "The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate."

  New York City Police commissioner Jessica Tisch said the helicopter took off around 3 pm, flying south before heading up the Manhattan shoreline to the George Washington Bridge turning back towards the downtown Manhattan heliport, losing control and hitting the water near a Hoboken pier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police commissioner said the aircraft was operated by New York Helicopter which did not respond to a request for comment but lists the Bell 206 among its fleet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another battering on Thursday, giving back a sizeable portion of the prior session's gains as investors grappled with lingering uncertainty about US President Donald Trump's trade and economic policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent the entire day in the red, disappointing traders who had been hoping to extend Wednesday's rally following Trump's pivot on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished down 3.5 percent at 5,268. The index had soared 9.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5 percent to 39,593, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.3 percent to 16,387.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's historic rally followed Trump's decision to pause for 90 days many of his most onerous tariffs on trading partners, while doubling down on levies on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks wiped out trillions of dollars in value in the sessions after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement before the president's reversal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But by Thursday, investors realized that Trump's tariff pause "is not enough to get people back in this market," said Peter Tuchman, senior floor trader at TradeMas Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed that US consumer inflation contracted 0.1 percent from a month earlier in a reading that was lower than analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traders have been unnerved by the massive reversals in Trump's policies, resulting in uncertainty that economists warn can paralyse consumers and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Energy was the biggest loser among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, where 10 groups finished in the red. Only consumer staples mustered a small gain. (AFP)

 Hong Kong Customs says it seized about 20 kilograms of suspected MDMA worth HK$4 million at the airport on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 31-year-old woman arriving from Vancouver was arrested after officers found the drugs in her checked luggage.
  <br>

  An investigation is ongoing.
  <br>

  Customs said it would continue targeting drug trafficking through intelligence-led enforcement and risk-based screening, particularly in high-risk regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public is urged not to carry unknown items or engage in drug trafficking for money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trafficking dangerous drugs carries a maximum penalty of HK$5 million and life imprisonment under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities have offered further support to insure local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) against pre-shipment risks amid sweeping tariffs, while announcing measures to help them tap into new markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taking immediate effect, the three measures introduced by the Hong Kong Export Credit Insurance Corporation came as US President Donald Trump decided to ramp up duties on Chinese goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau met on Thursday representatives of industries which were more affected by the tariffs to hear their views.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also hit out at Washington for "repeatedly changing its policies" and increasing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is totally illogical and ungrounded, once again showing the US's bullying act for suppressing its competitors," Yau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call upon the business community to unite and face the challenges together with a view to jointly counteracting the unreasonable coercion of the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures is the extension of free pre-shipment risk protection to "Small Business Policy" holders to June 30, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The insurance policy is tailor-made for exporters with an annual turnover of less than HK$50 million, covering contracts of sale and service they have with overseas buyers and clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exporters not covered by the "Small Business Policy" will also receive a 50 percent discount on pre-shipment cover premiums, while the premium rates for new markets have been slashed to align with those for traditional major markets to help them tap into Asean nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau pledged to maintain close liaison with the business trade to "jointly respond to the unreasonable coercion of the US" and support SMEs in financing, enhancing competitiveness and expanding into more diversified markets.
