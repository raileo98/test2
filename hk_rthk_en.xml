<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Brazil's President Lula discharged from hospital

<img alt="Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (second right) delivers a press conference with his wife and doctors at the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital in Sao Paulo. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783676_1_20241216140456.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was discharged on Sunday from a Sao Paulo hospital following emergency surgery to treat an intracranial hemorrhage.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am here in one piece... returning home calmly," the 79-year-old leader said as he made a surprise appearance at a news conference by his medical team at Hospital Sirio-Libanes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later smiled and waved to reporters as he left the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula had successful surgery last Tuesday in which doctors drilled through his skull to relieve pressure that built up after a blow to the head in October, when he fell in a bathroom in his presidential residence in the capital Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent a follow-up operation on Thursday to minimise the risk of further bleeding in the affected area of the protective intracranial membranes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president can resume activities but will need to take it easy for 15 days, cardiologist Roberto Kalil said at the news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a risk of the worst happening," Kalil said later in an interview with the Globo television network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula will remain in Sao Paulo until Thursday, when he will undergo follow-up tests. Once cleared, he will be able to return to Brasilia and his normal routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only restriction is physical exercise," said Kalil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another doctor, Ana Helena Germoglio, said Lula's recovery had "exceeded expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for his frenetic work pace, Lula burst into the news conference on Sunday without warning and approached the microphones, walking unassisted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He addressed reporters while wearing a fedora-style hat that covered signs of his operations, accompanied by his wife Rosangela "Janja" da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula's medical emergency started when he complained last Monday of a headache while in Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  An MRI scan found a hemorrhage between his brain and the dura mater membrane that protects it, prompting his swift transport to Hospital Sirio-Libanes -- the country's top medical facility -- for surgery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I confess I was scared by the volume of fluid growth in my head. I was worried by the urgency of the request" to go to the hospital, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never think I'm going to die, but I'm scared, so I need to follow the rules," Lula said, adding he will not go to the beach for the end-of-year holidays, as many Brazilians do.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going home now," he told reporters, "calm, sure that I'm cured and that I just need to take care of myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  After suffering his fall on October 19, Lula had told an official from his Workers' Party that the accident was "serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks following, the president skipped planned overseas trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from mid-November he resumed his active schedule, hosting a G20 summit in Rio and attending a Mercosur summit in Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest medical emergency adds to a list of health problems Lula has suffered over the years, including treatment in 2011 for throat cancer and a hip replacement operation last year. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An enhanced interactive exhibition dedicated to the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City has moved from the airport to Kai Tak's airside mall, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in the movie sets from  "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In".
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase of the exhibition, which was inspired by the movie, opened on Monday and will run until April 13 of next year, featuring several new photo spots, hidden gems for photography, and dining and retail stalls, including the iconic char siu rice from the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the exhibition's success at the airport demonstrated the strength of the SAR's movie tourism and local cultural exploration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The film industry in Hong Kong has great potential, especially when you consider that many of the filmmakers involved, both directors and screenwriters, are very young. The achievements they've made are highly commendable and have garnered much attention. Many critics have also recognised them. This is what makes me the happiest," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's perspective, we will continue to work hard to support the industry. In recent years, we have allocated about HK$4 billion into the Film Development Fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that an accompanying exhibition will be held at Kowloon Walled City Park, featuring a blend of both indoor and outdoor elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This exhibition is currently in the planning stages and also revolves around the 'Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In' theme. We are working hard to incorporate many different props. We hope to launch the exhibition in March or April of next year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, I'll keep some details under wraps, but further information will be provided by our colleagues from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency."

    Hundreds feared dead after cyclone hits Mayotte

<img alt="A man carries his belongings as rescue workers attempt to clear a blocked road, in the aftermath of Cyclone Chido in Mayotte. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783673_1_20241216132958.jpg&q=20">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials on Sunday said the death toll from Cyclone Chido's passage across Mayotte would be in the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, as France rushed rescue workers and supplies to the French island territory off Mozambique.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their efforts will be hindered by the damage to airports and electricity distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the cyclone's passage, clean drinking water was already subject to chronic shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand" deaths, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be "very difficult to reach a final count" given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of Cyclone Chido through Mayotte," she posted on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to provide support in the days to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also offered support, writing on X that his organisation "stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Sunday, the mayor of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP nine were in a critical condition in hospital, with another 246 more seriously injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm had "spared nothing", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that France's interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelago's shantytown, France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayotte's 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown on Saturday as Cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already Sunday, medical personnel and equipment were delivered Sunday by air and sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unicef said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told reporters. (AFP)

    South Korea's top court begins Yoon impeachment trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court kicked off proceedings on Monday over the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has been suspended from office over his failed bid to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon Yoon for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defence Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon’s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon’s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as “anti-state forces” bogging down his agendas and vowed to “fight to the end” against efforts to remove him from office. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

 The Consumer Council on Monday urged people to choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully, after finding EU-banned substances in some products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 25 anti-dandruff models and found that four contained zinc pyrithione (ZPT), which is banned in the European Union due to the potential harm to unborn children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four brands are HAIR CORNER, Petal Fresh Pure, CLEAR and Philip B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, the council’s chief executive, said consumers should identify the root cause of dandruff before buying products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you have dandruff, you have to identify probably what is the reason. Is [your scalp] too oily, or maybe too dry, or other reasons? This is something as a first screening about yourself,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But on the other hand, if you have this problem for quite a bit of time, it's much better for you to seek medical advice before you continue to try on different products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 90 percent of shampoo products also contained fragrance allergens, with two containing the EU-banned chemical BMHCA which can adversely affect both male and female fertility.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the watchdog said some products were not labelled at all or only included some fragrance allergens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to review their formulas and improve labelling transparency.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has reiterated its zero tolerance policy on workplace violence, including threatening staff and physical - or even verbal - abuse from patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Tung Chi-kwong, the authority's Workplace Violence Subject Officer of the New Territories West Cluster, told RTHK that cases of violence against staff fluctuated over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hoped to minimise such incidents by appealing to the public for a greater understanding of the issues facing its staff, and to create a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a very valuable occasion for us to actually plead to public members that we will try to induce a mutual-respect culture in the workplace, and then hopefully it will improve communications and new ways to kind of de-escalate the tension," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said cases of violence were often related to a patient's expectations not being met, such as long waiting times, or issues with the treatment plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was talking to frontline staff about their specific needs or the kinds of high-risk situations they faced, so it could provide tailor-made solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, we have been improving our designs of a forearm protector because one of the common injuries faced by our staff is when they have been doing some sort of routine nursing measures, like feeding or injection and so on. When our patients are in an abnormal mental state, they may consider the approach as threatening and sometimes they may have bitten or scratched our staff," said Dr Tung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said certain departments were more prone to violence, including psychiatry, geriatrics as well as the emergency room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Training was being given to staff from these departments, including break-away techniques to learn how to escape from dangerous situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Certain cases were also referred to the police, and the conviction rate was as high as 90 percent, the authority added.

    Beware of plasticisers in desk mats: Consumer Council
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said that some desk mats commonly used as table protectors contain chemicals that can affect fertility or growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among 15 desk mats it tested, seven contained four plasticisers listed as reproductive toxicants exceeding a European Union limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the worst example, plasticisers in a desk mat by Qivation surpassed the EU limit by 222 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The product has been referred to the Customs and Excise Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that nine desk mats contain three other plasticisers that can affect children's livers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although people are unlikely to absorb plasticisers through their skin, they are at risk if they have a cut, or put on sunscreen or oil-soluble moisturising products after touching the mats, the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, chief executive of the watchdog, urged the public not to use desk mats as place mats when they eat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reason being is obviously the ingredients that they used [in desk mats] may not be at the food grade, so it's much better to segregate the usage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you select the product, you have to make it clear about the purpose of that product. So that you can make use of it, the function of it properly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should also wash their hands immediately after using the desk mats in other circumstances, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also called on manufacturers to be careful about what ingredients they use in products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to choose those that can safeguard the health of consumers and manufacture it with a very high quality control in order to produce products that shouldn't have harmful substances for consumers," she said.

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen leaps across the goal line for his second touchdown against the Lions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783650_1_20241216110904.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen delivered another barnstorming performance with two rushing touchdowns, as the Buffalo Bills handed the Detroit Lions only their second defeat of the season with a 48-42 NFL victory at Ford Field on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blockbuster clash between the two high-scoring potential Super Bowl contenders did not disappoint, with Bills quarterback Allen once again underscoring his credentials as the front-runner for this season's Most Valuable Player award.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who rushed for three touchdowns and threw three more in Buffalo's defeat to the Los Angeles Rams last week, was in commanding form with 362 passing yards from 23-of-34 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bills running back James Cook also played a key role with two touchdowns and 105 rushing yards, which included one 41-yard sprint to the end zone in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Buffalo were always in control after racing into an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Detroit's offence kept the Lions in touch – with quarterback Jared Goff throwing five touchdowns and 494 passing yards in a game that saw the two teams combine for nearly 1,100 yards of offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills improved to 11-3 with the win, while Detroit fell to 12-2 to leave the Lions tied in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles – who defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for 290 yards with two touchdowns, and rushed for one more to set up the Philadelphia win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for two touchdowns but suffered a late injury scare as Kansas City eased to a 21-7 win over the Cleveland Browns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes limped off the field midway through the fourth quarter of a win that leaves Kansas City on 13-1, putting them on course to secure post-season home-field advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes was uncertain as to the severity of the injury but said he could have played on if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually you have to wait until the day after to get a good sense of it," Mahomes said. "I could have finished the game in different circumstances." (AFP)

    OSC-funded group wants to reach out to minorities

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity operating in the Eastern District is hoping to involve more ethnic minorities in community activities in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emily Yeung, an assistant social work officer at the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre, Social Welfare, says many non-Chinese senior citizens live in Eastern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told RTHK that a lot of them tend to stay at home and do not attend community events because of fear of not being able to communicate with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the community centre is one of 11 beneficiaries of the Operation Santa Claus (OSC) charity drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity was founded in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said with funding support from OSC, the charity will expand its “Narrating Life Stories - Supportive Project for Ethnic Minority Elders”, which trains volunteers to listen to the stories of ethnic minority elders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our project, we have welfare assistants that they can speak in their languages so that the elders can know the programme, what is going on, and they can have someone to share with as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>

    Man Utd deepen Guardiola's gloom; Chelsea cruise

<img alt="Manchester United's Leny Yoro battles for the ball with City midfielder Jack Grealish. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783632_1_20241216101239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United scored two late goals to deepen the pain for beleaguered Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, as Chelsea moved just two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on a day of high drama in the English top flight, Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and Southampton boss Russell Martin were both sacked, paying the price for their teams' struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the marquee game of the day at the Etihad, City defender Josko Gvardiol opened the scoring, but Bruno Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot in the 88th minute and Amad Diallo struck two minutes later to seal a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions City – who have dominated English football over the past decade – now have just one win in 11 games in all competitions and Guardiola is desperately searching for answers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a defence, I'm the boss, I'm the manager – I have to find a solution, and I don't find a solution," said the Catalan after the low-quality encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a big club, when you lose eight out of 11, something wrong is happening," he added. "What can I say? The schedule is tough, the injured players? No. I'm the boss, I'm the manager and I'm not good enough – it's as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men trail leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand, by nine points and sit outside the Champions League places, in fifth spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-ravaged City were far from their best at the Etihad but appeared to be on course for a vital win as the clock ticked down against their neighbours before they self-imploded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Nunes' sloppy back pass was cut out by Diallo and the Portuguese midfielder then chopped down the United winger in his attempt to make amends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes coolly converted from the penalty spot to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo then raced onto a simple long ball over the top of City's flat-footed defence, finishing neatly to complete a remarkable turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win is a huge relief for new United boss Ruben Amorim, who had won just one of his first four Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for the fans it has a deep meaning, especially in this context, in this moment," the former Sporting Lisbon boss said after his first experience of a Manchester derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a difficult moment one week ago against Nottingham Forest at home with a storm," he added. "It was a really tough moment after the game. Today, we are more happy, but it's three points that we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  United finished the day 13th in the Premier League table – where they started – after Tottenham hammered bottom club Southampton 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca's high-flying Chelsea beat Brentford 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to close to within two points of long-time leaders Liverpool, who have 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home team dominated the first half and got the reward they deserved shortly before the break when Marc Cucurella nodded home Noni Madueke's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson doubled Chelsea's lead in the 80th minute and they held out for the win despite a late strike from prolific Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a fifth straight win for Chelsea, who look increasingly like being Liverpool's main challengers this season, with Arsenal and City faltering. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday posted the third-fastest time ever recorded for the women’s 200-metre freestyle event, clocking in a time of one minute and 50.62 seconds to capture gold at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, finished nearly a second faster than Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey, who clocked in a time of one minute and 51.49 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Claire Weinstein rounded out the podium to take bronze with her one-minute-51.62 second performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey's result stands just behind only her world record, set in 2021 in Abu Dhabi, and Swedish Sarah Sjostrom‘s one minute and 50.43 from 2017. She now owns four of the five fastest times in event history.
  <br>
  <br>
  With that result, the four-time Olympic medallist for the SAR now has four 200-metre freestyle world crowns – along with one other in the 100-metre event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey had recently announced she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

 A woman has been bailed after she allegedly stole a sculpted model panda from a Kwun Tong public display on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 37-year-old was arrested in Sau Mau Ping on Saturday. She will have to report to police later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were called in after a security guard noticed that the model panda, valued at HK$100, had gone missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was part of an Urban Renewal Authority (URA) Christmas Celebration at Yue Man Square called 'Winter Transform'. It includes 80 giant panda installations, which range in height from half-a-metre to 3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said another model panda had disappeared last Monday but that the case was not classified as theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the display earlier this month, the URA said it features an industrial style panda and an astronaut panda - symbolising Kwun Tong's transformation from an industrial area to a modernised commercial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said, after Christmas, the pandas would be displayed in festive Chinese New Year attire.

    Acting South Korean president moves to reassure allies

<img alt="Han Duck-soo spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783580_1_20241215193531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday to reassure the country's allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly," Han said, according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a further attempt to stabilise the Asian nation's leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon's December 3 martial law decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures," Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Yoon did not appear on Sunday morning in response to a summons for questioning in a criminal investigation into his martial law decision, and they promised to issue another order, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, abuse of authority and obstructing people from exercising their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, a longtime technocrat picked by the conservative Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon's case moves to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators seeking Yoon's ouster braved the cold to throng the streets outside the National Assembly building where he was impeached. The crowd was about 200,000, according to police, Yonhap said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Han's role is only acting president, "I hope he will exercise the minimum power to operate the country stably, rather than actively be involved in state affairs," said Jo Sung-woo, a 39-year-old Seoul resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 8.5 km away, a much smaller number of Yoon supporters demonstrated in the central Seoul area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really can't stand to see these illegal lawmakers who were elected by fraudulent elections making evil laws and now this huge opposition party is running wild on their own," said Yim Joung-sook, 55.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea's diplomatic partners, worried over the country's ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said in a statement that the US president "expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK," using the abbreviation for the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday's impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spoke by phone with the commander of US Forces Korea, expressing concern about the possibility North Korea could attempt military provocations, such as launching ballistic missiles or cyber attacks, Yonhap said, citing Han's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president," he said. "He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals."
  <br>
  <br>
  But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon. If he is removed or resigns, a new elections will be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after the impeachment vote in parliament, which followed a failed vote a week earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee said the most pressing issue is a slump in consumption caused by insufficient domestic demand and the government's reduction of its fiscal role.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a National Stability Council for Governance comprising the government and parliament to discuss finance, economy and public livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to promptly discuss a supplementary budget," Lee said, adding that such a measure could support for small businesses and investments related to artificial intelligence and infrastructure to try to head off energy shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament, controlled by Lee's party, passed a 673.3 trillion won (US $470.6 billion) 2025 budget bill on Tuesday that cut the government's 677.4 trillion won proposal, without reaching agreement with Yoon's People Power Party and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law parliament cannot increase government budgets, and at the time the Democratic Party said a supplementary budget could be needed to address spending for people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party said its cuts were mostly in reserve funds for the government, interest costs and funds allocated to the presidential office, prosecutors and auditors for classified operations. The government accused parliament of delaying projects for small businesses with the cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deadlock over budget issues was one of the justifications Yoon cited for imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's financial authorities vowed on Sunday to act as needed to stabilise markets while the finance minister said he would announce an economic policy plan by year's end. (Reuters)

    More and more fancy a shot at joining the police

 Police say more and more young people are now interested in joining the force and it aims to recruit another 400 officers and 80 inspectors in the next few months.
 <br>
  <br>
  With almost 6,000 vacancies across various departments, the force held a recruitment day on Sunday, giving people a taste of what it feels to like to wear the uniform, and even fire a gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set up a mock firearm experience station so participants can experience the shock of a pistol firing a bullet, and also see how police constables receive weapons training," Senior Superintendent Mike Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also set up a booth that consists of AI police uniforms, where participants can try on different police attire and take photos."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 1,300 people attended the event, with 400 submitting applications on the spot, the force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said more than 9,000 applications for officer and inspector roles were received between April 1 and November 30, a 5.4 percent increase on the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 600 new officers were taken on, along with about 120 probationary inspectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more and more young people being interested in police work," Kwok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether a relaxation in eligibility requirements from May 2023 contributed to the increase in applications, Kwok said the force is trying to "snatch talent".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope our market competitiveness will suit societal demands. Of course we would want as much applicants as possible. But I think the increase was mainly due to people being interested in the job as we have held a lot of recruitment activities in local and mainland universities," he said.

    'Lack of awareness leading to migrant worker abuse'

<img alt="Domestic worker groups say some helpers are only being paid HK$1,000 per month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783564_2_20241215165703.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Domestic worker groups on Sunday warned that a lack of knowledge on rights and legal protections is leading to some helpers being abused in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) and the Union of Nepalese Domestic Workers in Hong Kong (UNDW) said that in the past two years, they received eight complaints from South Asian workers who had been severely underpaid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarah Pun, an executive member of FADWU and vice-chairwoman of UNDW, said many workers are only being paid HK$1,000 to HK$4,000 per month, when the minimum wage is HK$4,990.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Some of] the workers in Hong Kong don't know any rights of what is their proper salary and what is their contract salary, so some employers take advantage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our South Asian [domestic workers], don't have an agent in Hong Kong. The broker will tell them to come to Hong Kong because all those who want to come to Hong Kong, they also want to earn the money for themselves to support the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do some agreement, I think, with some amount, but they will not tell the worker the proper amount of the contract salary. So, they will just tell them that the only important thing is the job."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Nepali woman who turned to the groups for help told reporters that she was not paid her full salary, had her passport confiscated by her employer, and suffered constant mental and physical abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They did not provide me proper food. They did not provide me a room, no bed. I had to sleep on a [sofa]. They did not give me any rest days. There were no fixed working hours. I had to work 24 hours. That was what I was told," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They always found fault in my work and they were always complaining. They used to scold me with foul language and assault me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pun said the government should arrange mandatory training for both incoming helpers and employers, to increase awareness of responsibilities and fair wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the authorities should ensure that migrant domestic workers are aware of their rights and how to seek justice in the case of violations.

    'Bali Nine' drug smugglers return home: Australia

<img alt="Some of the 'Bali Nine' were held on death row in Kerobokan prison in Denpasar. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783560_2_20241215151025.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's government said on Sunday that five members of the "Bali Nine" drug ring have returned from Indonesia, after diplomatic efforts between the countries this month to strike a repatriation deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian Government can confirm that Australian citizens, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj have returned to Australia," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men were among nine people arrested in 2005 trying to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin out of the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These Australians served more than 19 years in prison in Indonesia. It was time for them to come home," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of ringleaders of the Bali Nine group, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in 2015, prompting Australia to recall its ambassador in protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only woman in the group was released from prison in 2018, and a male member died of cancer the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to convey our deep appreciation to the Government of Indonesia for its cooperation to facilitate the men's return to Australia on humanitarian grounds," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the men's return reflected "the strong bilateral relationship and mutual respect between Indonesia and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Senior Minister for Legal Affairs Yusril Ihza Mahendra this month met Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke in Jakarta and handed over a draft proposal for the return of the five prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the draft included the five being banned from returning to Indonesia, regulations on the legal basis for the transfer and a requirement that Australia respect the decision of the Indonesian court, Yusril said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusril said at the time that Indonesia would respect any decision taken by Australia when the prisoners returned home, including if the group was granted a pardon. He said the repatriation would not involve an exchange of prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's government did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Sunday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese police were searching on Sunday for the attacker who fatally stabbed a junior high school student and wounded another at a McDonald's restaurant, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teens were in line to order around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the attacker entered the fast-food restaurant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, and wordlessly stabbed them both, according to national broadcaster NHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were rushed to hospital where the girl later died. The other victim, a boy, survived and told police he did not know the man who had stabbed them, NHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear whether the girl knew the man, who remained at large on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of police have deployed to find the attacker, described as a man who appears to be in his 40s, wearing a grey jacket and dark pants, according to Television Nishinippon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack happened in less than a minute, local media reported, adding that around 10 customers were inside the restaurant at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent crime is rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws. But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday urged Hongkongers to "team up for a brighter future" as he invited people to put forward suggestions for his next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  A consultation exercise ahead of the blueprint expected in February got underway on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the government doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said the government has to carefully manage public finances as the global outlook remains gloomy and the city is undergoing economic transformation. But he added that accelerating the city's economic development is of equal importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this period, development is core and stability is the key. The administration has been seeking to expand into new markets and strengthen its position in technological innovation. Results of this are now beginning to flow through," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's make wise use of resources, and team up for a brighter future," he added, in a promotional video on the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the city's market sentiment has been improving, with the central government continuously rolling out measures to support Hong Kong, including bringing back unlimited entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 130,000 mainlanders visited the SAR last weekend, Chan said, adding that this was a 15 percent increase on the average number in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of innovative technology start-ups in the city is continuing to grow and a lot of enterprise founders from across the world agree that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in innovation and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign companies are confident towards Hong Kong. The government's efforts overseas in promoting the city's advantage and telling real Hong Kong stories are yielding positive impacts," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Challenges are inevitable in each development stage, but we have to focus on greater opportunities and prospects. According to our past experiences, Hong Kong remains strong despite highs and lows, and we will continue to make steps forward in new developments and reach newer heights," he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures struggled to reach 15 degrees Celsius across much of the city on Sunday morning, as the observatory warned of the coldest day so far this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A low of 13 degrees was recorded at the forecasters' headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was even colder in parts of the New Territories, the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A strong northeast monsoon will affect the coast of southern China today. Since it will be windy, wind chill effect will be particularly significant on high ground and exposed areas. People are advised to be aware of the change in weather and keep warm when engaging in outdoor activities," it warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that daytime temperatures are expected to rise this week, but mornings will still be cool.

    ABC faces US$15mn payout over Trump lawsuit

<img alt="Donald Trump waves to spectators at the Army-Navy football game in Landover on Saturday. The president-elect has won several legal battles since last month's election.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 ABC News will pay a US$15 million settlement payment to resolve a defamation lawsuit brought by President-elect Donald Trump, according to court documents filed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit stemmed from on-air comments made by top anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump was found "liable for rape" during an interview with US Representative Nancy Mace that aired in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the settlement require ABC News to make a US$15 million donation to a fund dedicated to "a presidential foundation and museum" for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news organization and Stephanopoulos will also issue public apologies saying they "regret statements" made about Trump during the aforementioned interview, and the broadcaster will pay an addition US$1 million in attorney fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was settled one day after Judge Lisette M. Reid requested depositions from both Trump and Stephanopoulos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had been found liable for sexual abuse -- a different transgression from rape under New York law -- in a 2023 case filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement marks the latest legal victory for Trump since winning the November 5 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a US appeals court granted the dismissal of charges for Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents upon exiting the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith also paused a second federal case regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, although Trump faces racketeering charges over the same issue in a case out of Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  And for Trump's May conviction in the hush money case -- the only criminal charges against him to go to trial -- Judge Juan Merchan has indefinitely postponed sentencing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.

  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.

  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.

  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.

  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

 Authorities in Thailand have arrested two men following a bomb blast at a festival near the border with Myanmar that killed three people and wounded dozens, police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An improvised explosive device went off on a dance floor at a festival in Umphang district in Thailand's northern Tak province on Friday night, according to local police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were killed instantly and another died later in hospital, police said. The explosion also injured 48 people among approximately 8,000-9,000 attending the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai police said they had arrested a Thai youth and a man they said was a member of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority rebel group that has fought the Myanmar military for decades for autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar's Karen state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tak police chief Major-General Samrit Ekamol said the Myanmar suspect had thrown the bomb after encountering a "rival gangster" he had previously fought with.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior KNU denied any involvement and said the group did not have any members in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The KNU can call on more than 5,000 fighters, maintains close links with the Thai police and military, and has extensive business interests on both sides of the border, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and urged security agencies to carry out an investigation. (AFP)

 Georgia's ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country's president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected former Manchester City striker Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country's next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.
  <br>

  The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote "illegitimate" and refused to step down. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UN envoy on Saturday urged foreign powers to work to avoid a collapse of vital Syrian institutions following the downfall of leader Bashar al-Assad, as diplomats gathered in Jordan for a conference on the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geir Pedersen, the UN's special envoy for Syria, also backed a "credible and inclusive" political process to form the next government as he met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible," Pedersen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Arab, Turkish, EU and US diplomats are holding talks in the Jordanian Red Sea resort city of Aqaba less than a week after Islamist-led rebels toppled Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, on a trip in which he met the leaders of Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, has repeatedly called for an "inclusive" process that reflects all the diverse ethnic and religious communities in Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting Pedersen, Blinken said the United Nations "plays a critical role" in humanitarian assistance and protecting minorities in Syria. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has elaborated on the plan to reform the healthcare system due to population and demographic changes - specifically boosting health management efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau earlier pointed out that even though the overall population in the SAR will increase in 2041, that's not the case for Hong Kong Island, which might drop slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the key components of the plan, is the merging of Hong Kong East and West hospital clusters, which the health chief said would improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Saturday, Lo said the move aims to utilise resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at merging the Hong Kong East and West clusters to co-care for 1.2 million people on Hong Kong Island. This will improve management and administration efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of medical services, it will allow the two to have a strong collaboration through increased cooperation in terms of training and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that services offered by Eastern Hospital would remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the bureau is also looking into adjusting public hospital charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo revealed that critical and emergency patients might be charged less, noting that the government is responsible for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for semi and non urgent patients, he said the authority will offer more a precise subsidy for them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to remove President Yoon Suk Yeol from office for his failed attempt to impose martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Out of 300 lawmakers, 204 voted to impeach the president on allegations of insurrection while 85 voted against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three abstained, with eight votes nullified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is now suspended from office while South Korea's Constitutional Court deliberates whether to uphold his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in as the interim president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court now has 180 days to rule on Yoon's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it backs his removal, Yoon would become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached.
  <br>
  <br>
  For weeks, thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul to demand Yoon’s resignation and jailing after his short-lived martial law declaration sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers quickly responded, breaking the military cordon and assembling in parliament to vote down the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, prosecutors said they had arrested a military commander who headed the capital defence command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrest warrants were also issued by the Seoul central district court for the national police chief and the head of the city’s police, citing the “risk of destruction of evidence”. (AFP/Agencies)

 People flocked to Victoria Park in Wan Chai to enjoy one of Hong Kong's largest outdoor fairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, the Brands and Products Expo opened on Saturday and will run until January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's event saw 900 booths set up, with some offering discounts, including HK$1 special deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lady said she had not been to the fair for many years, and this time, she bought a bag of medicinal herbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a steal. I didn't line up for too long. You can't imagine how happy I am because I got so many things for just HK$1. It would originally cost at least HK$100," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she arrived at the venue four hours early to make sure she got what she was looking for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Abalones and fish maw. I will make soup and other delicious dishes. It's almost new year and also the winter solstice," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also visited the Expo, and bought soup packs, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimps and egg rolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman Wingco Lo said Hong Kong's retail market had been facing various challenges, but with the festive atmosphere and the resumption of the multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, he's confident with the sales from the fair.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up his four-day duty visit to Beijing, making a last stop at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in the capital before returning home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, alongside Chief Secretary Eric Chan who arrived in Beijing on Friday, met Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security, as well as other mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a government statement, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the integrated development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and building the SAR into an international hub for high-calibre talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee reported to the minister that the idea of the committee came from President Xi Jinping, who “pointed out that education development, scientific and technological innovation, and talent cultivation should be promoted as an integrated effort”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He said he hopes that the [Hong Kong] SAR government can create joint forces with the ministry in serving the country’s workforce development strategy and make greater contributions to building a great country in all respects through Chinese modernisation,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the chief secretary, who chairs the committee, said the group would leverage Hong Kong’s strategic positioning and advantages in its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee held its first meeting on Friday and agreed to review and improve existing schemes on attracting high-performing individuals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the debut of pandas An An and Ke Ke have boosted the atmosphere at the park, and he expects the facility to see more visitors during festive holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two pandas gifted by the central government earlier made their first appearance to the public, and Pong said tourists from both home and abroad have been lining up to spend time with the animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme on Saturday, the chairman said the park was ready for a visitor boom in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is always a peak. We normally expect more visitors during Christmas and Chinese New Year, and now people are eagerly looking forward to visiting the giant pandas. We know they're going to visit the park during these festivals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said Ying Ying's baby twins are expected to greet visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether visitors would have to pay extra to see the twins, Pong said he had not considered it yet, but stressed that ticketing is integral for Ocean Park's income.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Water World has been closed for a seasonal break this winter, instead of keeping its doors open all year round as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said this allowed better allocation of manpower, so that more staff could help out at Ocean Park when the Water World was having a slack season.

    'HK can expand its market in developing EV'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transformation into green transportation is a new opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its market in developing electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Tse Chin-wan, who told a radio programme that while many countries and regions are promoting green transportation, not many places have double-decker buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities earlier announced a green transformation roadmap of public buses and taxis, with plans to subsidise the purchase of electric buses and taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief stressed that it's worth investing as Hong Kong can make use of the advantage and expand its market in the technology that's involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This green transformation actually provides opportunities under the establishment of a new economy... If we use subsidies to help double-decker buses develop the technology, we can grasp the opportunity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international city and we can set an example for other places."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government shelved the pay-as-you-throw scheme earlier this year, and though some green groups say the scheme should still be rolled out at some point, Tse noted that the authorities would continue to promote waste reduction and recycling rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there are different means to do so, but the ultimate aim is to establish a green-focused culture in society.

 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

 President Xi Jinping will conduct a three-day visit to Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR’s return to the motherland, Xinhua reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will be in Macau from December 18 to 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will be "at the inauguration ceremony of the sixth-term government" of Macau, Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau’s chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai and his cabinet will be sworn in on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Xi will also conduct an inspection tour during his stay in the Macau SAR,” the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sam offered his warm welcome and expressed his gratitude to Xi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the president’s visit shows the central government’s support and care towards the SAR.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

    Xi briefed on plans to achieve HK fiscal balance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he detailed to President Xi Jinping strategies to achieve fiscal balance "in three to five years", after the SAR government warned the deficit would balloon to around HK$100 billion for the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who was received by the president on the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, added the administration will aim to develop new growth points and grasp the opportunities provided by the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the CE was asked if the president was concerned by the SAR government's fiscal situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have explained the strategies that we will be adopting to ensure that we will eventually make a balanced budget. That may take a few years," Lee replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said one way to strengthen the city's economy would be "expanding outside" to markets like Asean and the Middle East, or even Latin America and central Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nation still offers "the biggest opportunities" for Hong Kong, Lee stressed, and that it's up to the SAR to capitalise on them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee revealed he and the president also discussed safeguarding national security, raising the level of governance, boosting development momentum, and improving people's livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a brief photo call at the start of the closed-door meeting, Xi had affirmed Lee's work and hailed his administration for completing the "historic legislation" of Basic Law Article 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that recognition speaks for itself. I am a believer of there is never the best, only the better. That is also the doctrine advocated by President Xi. In this area, we see things in the same angle," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I have been making reports to him as to how I can create extra synergy, new development, and also create economic growth for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will meet officials from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in Beijing on Saturday, before returning to the SAR on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee hoped the exchange would provide insight to a recently established SAR committee on education, technology and talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group, announced in his policy address, is chaired by the chief secretary.

    France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist leader Francois Bayrou as prime minister, handing him the daunting task of hauling France out of months of political crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou, the 73-year-old head of the MoDem group which is allied to Macron's party, was appointed nine days after Michel Barnier's government was ousted by parliament in a historic no-confidence vote following a standoff over an austerity budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President of the Republic has appointed Mr Francois Bayrou as prime minister and tasked him with forming a government," the French presidency said in a statement, giving no more details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou is the sixth prime minister of Macron's mandate after last week's toppling of Barnier, who became France's shortest-serving prime minister and lasted only three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also Macron's fourth prime minister of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou now faces an immediate challenge in putting together a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence vote in a deeply divided parliament and thrash out a 2025 budget in a bid to limit economic turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Macron received Bayrou for nearly two hours of talks Friday. BFMTV reported the talks with Bayrou had been "tense".
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier, 73, was expected to hand over power to his successor at a ceremony late on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England were placed in a group with Serbia as the draw for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Europe took place on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As they prepare to begin life under new coach Thomas Tuchel, England were also drawn alongside Albania, Latvia and Andorra in the five-team Group K.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matches will take place between March and November next year, with the group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runners-up in each of the 12 qualifying groups will get a second chance via a series of play-offs, with Europe now contributing a total of 16 nations to the expanded 48-team competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact make-up of the groups is not yet completely clear as it depends on the outcome of the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties will see reigning European champions Spain face the Netherlands, while Germany play Italy, Portugal take on Denmark and France meet Croatia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups in which these teams end up depend on whether they win and progress to the Nations League semi-finals next June, or are eliminated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are six groups of five teams who will begin qualifying in March, while the six groups of four teams will only start next September. (AFP)

 The government announced on Friday a two-fold proposal to handle unauthorised building works, with those convicted of serious breaches facing a maximum jail term of two years and a HK$2 million fine.
 <br>
  <br>
  While stiffer penalties could be introduced for serious contraventions of the Buildings Ordinance, authorities are also rolling out a leniency scheme for minor unlawful works deemed to be low risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau conducted a review of the existing regulations following a spate of incidents where chunks of concrete fell off the exterior facade of ageing buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was also public concern after a landslide exposed unauthorised structures at multiple Redhill Peninsula villas last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Buildings Ordinance, those who ignore removal orders for "serious unauthorised works", such as an illegal basement, could be jailed for two years, double the current ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum fine would also be raised by 50 percent to HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Owners, building professionals or contractors who erect structures without government approval even face a HK$2 million fine, up from HK$400,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also proposing to lower the prosecution threshold, such that proceedings could be initiated even when the person concerned doesn't "knowingly" begin construction without permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who inherit illegal structures from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain time frame after the new law is passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatively minor additions, including retractable awnings and outdoor signboards fixed to the floor, could be performed without prior approval in the future so long as the structures fit the prescribed size and height.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also plan to relax requirements for drying racks for clothes and air conditioner support frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a three-year grace period for owners to have minor structures inspected by a certified professional. Structures which are approved can be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokeswoman said the policy is aimed at minimising nuisance to the public. But the bureau was also aware of opinions that existing laws are not deterrent enough for serious breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, our resources are limited. So we want to focus our law enforcement efforts on the most serious cases, tackling the bigger illegal structures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which are served to premises aged 30 years or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal will begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says President Xi Jinping showed his affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783388_1_20241213183923.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Friday said Hong Kong needs more long-term planning in connecting its development strategy with that of the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said President Xi Jinping showed affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration during their exchanges in Beijing on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultant said Lee was awarded with a high evaluation due to the SAR completing national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law earlier this year, and its efforts in building ties with different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think particularly [President Xi is] concerned about Hong Kong's international development space, which has been, to a certain extent, shrunk by the United States and the West," Lau told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why President Xi must be happy to see John Lee and his government trying to develop, or to enlarge, Hong Kong's international economic space by developing closer relationships with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi was optimistic on Hong Kong's economy, and he expects "reform" and "innovation" to be the major principles for the city's future governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that it would require long-term planning so that Hong Kong could connect its development strategy with that of the mainland's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan also departed for Beijing to join the chief executive in meeting with relevant ministries in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi may want Hong Kong to boost its inter-departmental cooperation and also work with the central government to tackle external threats as US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That might involve a bigger impact on Hong Kong, and may also involve Hong Kong cooperating with the central authorities so that we can jointly handle the threats coming from Trump and his new administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Lee meeting leaders from universities in Beijing, Lau said Hong Kong has to strengthen its exchanges with mainland universities to further enable the city to serve as an educational hub.

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaking with local residents at the site of a missile strike carried out by Russia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783385_1_20241213182214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Friday said Russia launched a massive aerial attack against the country's energy infrastructure, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as one of the heaviest bombardments on the country's energy sector since the war began almost three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian defences shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes, according to Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A strong reaction from the world is needed,” Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to disrupt civilian life and Ukrainian defence manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest attack comes as uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether American military support for Kyiv will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said on Friday that Trump's opposition to Ukraine firing US-supplied weapons deep into Russia "fully aligned" with Moscow's position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statement fully aligns with our position, with our view on the reasons for escalation. It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry says it carried out the attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in retaliation for Kyiv's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said that air- and sea-based long-range precision weapons and drones were used against "critical facilities of Ukraine's fuel and energy infrastructure that support the military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar massive attack on November 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia also said on Friday that discussions of possibly deploying European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine to guarantee a future ceasefire were premature, and added it wanted peace rather than simply a truce. (Agencies)

<img alt="The CE thanked President Xi and the central government for their continued support of Hong Kong." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783377_2_20241213174844.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has praised Chief Executive John Lee for implementing the city’s domestic national security law and shoring up the global influence of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi, who received Lee on Friday during the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, also said the central government fully recognised the work of the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the past year, you have led the SAR government to be responsible and pragmatic in completing the historic legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, focusing on economic development and promoting solutions to people’s livelihood issues such as housing and healthcare,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have strengthened external exchanges and cooperation, which not only enhanced the international influence [of Hong Kong], but also further consolidated the great momentum of Hong Kong’s stable development. The central government fully affirms your work and that of the SAR government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said central authorities fully support the SAR government in leading Hong Kong to seek reforms and make greater contributions to the city’s prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee thanked Xi for his continued care and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the halfway point of the term for the current government. It is a critical period for leading Hong Kong to move forward, and to inherit the past and usher in the future. It is also an important moment to make great contributions to the building of a great country through Chinese modernisation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has seen results in different areas over the past two and half years, Lee said, with global rankings of the city reflecting the confidence in the SAR and proving that the policy direction is correct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the senior leaders at the meeting were Premier Li Qiang; Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang; and Cai Qi, director of the central committee’s general office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong were also present.

 The Hang Seng Index ended the week on Friday sharply lower, finishing down 2.09 percent to close at 19,971, its biggest decline in a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday proposed amendments to road traffic regulations to improve road safety and keep up with new technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the changes is requiring electric vehicles to have acoustic warning systems to alert pedestrians. Private cars will also need to use child restraining devices, while vehicles with extendable aerial structures must have over-height warning systems installed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals also include allowing remote control parking features and camera-monitor systems as alternatives to traditional mirrors. Electric commercial vehicles will also be permitted to use expressways without special permits under the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a Transport and Logistics Bureau spokesman said the government will continue updating regulations as needed to keep pace with evolving technologies and international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to create a safer and more convenient road environment for road users in Hong Kong through optimising vehicle design and construction standards with the amendment regulations," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments will be tabled to the Legislative Council next Wednesday for negative vetting.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said he saw "encouraging signs" of progress towards a ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza Strip on a visit to Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about the imperative of Hamas saying 'yes' to the agreement that's possible, to finally help bring this to an end. And we appreciate very much the role that Turkey can play in using its voice with Hamas to try to bring this to conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire [in Gaza] in place. And what we've seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that is possible," Blinken said after meeting Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two diplomats also discussed the situation in Syria which is in a state of flux following the fall of president Bashar al-Assad last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidan said that possible Turkish and US roles for Syria's future were among the topics they discussed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Turkey's priority in Syria is ensuring the stability and prevention of domination by groups deemed terrorists after the ouster of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken said it was "imperative" to work against a resurgence of the Islamic State group in Syria post-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country worked very hard... to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that that threat doesn't rear its head again. And it's imperative that we keep at those efforts," Blinken said in Ankara at a press conference with Fidan. (Agencies)

    Communication vital when medical incidents occur: HA

<img alt="The Hospital Authority says good communication procedures are essential when handling crises and reporting incidents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783350_1_20241213155420.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said training its spokespersons on how to communicate with the public and family members after medical incidents occur is necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  This recommendation of setting up a spokesperson preparedness programme comes from a review committee tasked with improving the authority’s management, which put forward various suggestions last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration had earlier ordered the authority to review its management following a spate of medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told a Legco panel meeting on Friday that it’s impossible to avoid medical incidents entirely, highlighting the incident rate in Hong Kong is much lower than in other advanced healthcare systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority’s chief executive, added that proper communication to avoid misunderstanding is more important.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must understand that adverse clinical outcomes do happen. That is the same everywhere. The point is to communicate the incident well to the public, the family members and our internal staff members to be transparent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On this, we think training is needed. Most of the time, we focus our training on medical training. So there's room for improvements in terms of communication skills. That's why we will follow up on this recommendation seriously.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the other recommendations put forward by the review committee is for a high-level reform committee, which will be formed and led by the HA’s chairman Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers asked the HA for a clear timeline on the committee's formation and whether legislators could get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the HA has begun its work on this issue, noting that no more details can be given at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liberal Party lawmaker Peter Shiu, who's also a former Eastern District Council member, expressed concern about the authority’s plan to merge the Western and Eastern Hong Kong Island hospital clusters, saying he’s heard people worry that some hospitals would be shut down after the integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo assured the legislator that hospital services will remain unaffected, noting the cluster is designed to cater to the population distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In 2041, there should be 8.5 million people in Hong Kong. A cluster would serve one-seventh of the population. So I think that is necessary for us to review and make adjustment. By integrating the two clusters, the Eastern Hospital services will not be affected. There could even be improvement because upon integration, the management and administrative efficiency will be enhanced,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel’s chair Chan Hoi-yan, for her part, raised concerns over the rising expenditure of the HA, noting the authority will receive over HK$95 billion in subsidies this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo mentioned that healthcare expenditures make up only 3.9 percent of the SAR’s GDP, which is quite low by global standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister said Hong Kong is well-known for the cost-effectiveness of its healthcare system, but also noted that an ageing population and implementation of new healthcare technologies are putting a strain on finances.

 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will decide whether and when to conduct military exercises in accordance with its needs and the situation on the ground, a defence spokesperson said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks when responding to media questions on military drills following Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's recent transit through Hawaii and Guam, emphasising the PLA's unwavering resolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu reaffirmed the PLA's mission to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and defend the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any attempt to split the nation through soliciting external support or resorting to force will be punished, and will never succeed," Wu said. (Xinhua)

    Govt urged to subsidise installation of taxi cameras

<img alt="Taxi drivers are required to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783335_2_20241213134537.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to subsidise taxi drivers to help them install surveillance cameras while providing more education for cabbies struggling to adapt to new electronic payment systems.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows a legislative proposal to require taxi drivers to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026, and implement electronic payment methods by late 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel on Friday, newly appointed transport minister Mable Chan said the proposal had been well-received by the public and the taxi trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proposing a win-win situation for passengers, taxi drivers as well as the entire taxi trade. We will be able to enable all passengers to have a better travelling experience with these systems. We will also be able to increase the deterrent effect for the black sheep in the trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Ryan Wong who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi Council, said he’s worried about rising operational costs and urged the government to consider subsidising CCTV camera installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said while the industry generally welcomes introducing e-payment means, some taxi drivers may not be familiar with digital platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some drivers may not be very familiar with using these platforms, which is a bit worrying. But we believe that through education and even workshops to provide information, this problem can be solved," he told reporters before the panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick said he doesn't think privacy is an issue as the government has implemented a system in which camera footage can only be accessed by authorised personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at all other public transport in Hong Kong, they already have a CCTV camera there. So I think you have to remember, even within the taxi cab, it's not a totally private place. It's semi-private. So I think the most important thing is to make sure the passengers are aware that the CCTV system is on," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton stars Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet on Friday crashed out of the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, falling to the national team's Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin in three games.
 <br>
  <br>
  That result could be the end of the road for the SAR pair, with Tse having already hinted at retirement earlier this year as she continues to battle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei pulled ahead late to win the opening game, 21-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Tang and Tse to bounce back, though, claiming a nail-biting 21-19 victory in the second to force a winner-take-all third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by six at the break, the SAR pair put up a fight by scoring six straight points to cut the deficit at 14-11.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jiang and Wei pulled away to seal a 21-15 victory to round out the 63 minute match-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong duo finished group play with one win and two losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei will join compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in the knockout round, which begins on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest chess world champion on Thursday after beating defending champion Ding Liren of China in the final match of their series in Singapore.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju, 18, secured 7.5 points against 6.5 of his Chinese rival in the contest, surpassing the achievement of Russia’s Garry Kasparov who won the title at the age of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian teen prodigy has long been considered a rising star in the chess world after he became a chess grandmaster at 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had entered the match as the youngest-ever challenger to the world crown after winning the Candidates tournament earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After securing victory, Dommaraju burst into tears and raised his arms in celebration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years. I am happy that I realised the dream (and made it) into reality,” he told reporters after his win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju is now the second Indian to win the title after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand, who has been a mentor to Dommaraju, said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the 18-year-old on his “remarkable accomplishment,” calling it “the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s match was a 14-round long-time classical event with a prize fund of US$2.5 million. (AP)

 A memorial ceremony was held in Nanjing on Friday in honour of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mourners gathered at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders to remember those killed by invading Japanese forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers placed numerous large floral wreaths on stage, before the national anthem was played and a moment of silence held to a lowered national flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed during the six-week massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as National Memorial Day, to ensure the massacre is not forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, there are only 32 living registered survivors of the massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1945, the war against Japan came to an end as Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender in the Second World War. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)
