<div class="itemFullText">
 Large crowds flocked to the waterfront promenade along the West Kowloon Cultural District on Tuesday for a spectacular pyrotechnics show to mark Christmas Eve.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many people RTHK spoke to said they were extremely impressed with the 10-minute "Winter Harbourfront Pyrotechnics", which will be on for three consecutive nights from December 24 to 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eunice, a resident from Macau, said celebrating Christmas Eve in Hong Kong for the first time was a delightful experience, with the pyrotechnic show serving as an unexpected bonus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely impressed. It's just crazy to me. It's my first time witnessing an experience like this and I think it's great. I really like the excitement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was this family in front of me and their little baby going 'wa' every single time and it just really made my day. It's the highlight of my day trip here in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Guangzhou said the show symbolised Hong Kong's prosperity, and wished it could be longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a group of children clad in Christmas attire enthusiastically awarded the show 20,000 points for its beauty, while saying they enjoyed spending time with each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said special traffic and transport arrangements are in place to cater for those enjoying the festivities, with MTR local lines and seven light rail lines operating overnight on Christmas Eve, and KMB also strengthening services on many routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Airlines on Tuesday lifted an hour-long ground stop of all its flights in the US due to an unspecified technical issue, a notice on the U.S. aviation regulator's website showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ground stop, ahead of the busy Christmas travel, had threatened the holiday plans of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A technical issue is affecting American flights this morning. Our teams are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience," the company had said in a statement following the ground stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  American operates thousands of flights per day to more than 350 destinations in more than 60 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the carrier clawed back lost ground and were marginally down before the bell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Federal Aviation Administration in a statement referred Reuters to the airline, reiterating that the carrier had reported a technical issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  American was responding to comments on X as numerous users posted there, as well as on Bluesky and Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hey, @AmericanAir just tell us whether we should go home or not. Please don't make us wait in the airport for hours," wrote one user.
  <br>
  <br>
  The grounding comes months after airlines were hit by a global tech outage tied to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and a software issue at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years ago, Southwest Airlines experienced a meltdown with its systems during the holidays that led to 16,900 flight cancellations and stranded 2 million passengers. It was eventually fined US$140 million in the largest-ever civil penalty for a travel disruption. (Reuters)

 A powerful blast ripped through an explosives plant in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday killing 12 people and injuring four others, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Footage showed shards of glass and metal scattered outside the plant, where ambulances stood by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to initial reports, 12 employees died and four were taken to hospital with injuries as a result of the explosion" in the Karesi district of Balikesir province, local governor Ismail Ustaoglu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the injured were not in a serious condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blast took place at 8.25am local time (0525 GMT) at a section of the plant which local officials said collapsed under the force of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the cause of the blast at the factory, which is located away from residential areas, was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to find out what caused it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities ruled out sabotage and prosecutors have launched a thorough investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

 A Macau official has died after a car accident in an industrial area of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Macau's Government Information Bureau said Chief of the Office of the Secretary for Security, Cheong Ioc-ieng, died after the crash on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A clip that circulated online showed the front of a private car engulfed in flames after a collision with a bus. The car reportedly lost control on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video showed Cheong, who had been driving the car, being pulled out of the vehicle by passers-by before firefighters arrived.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters said three people were injured at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheong was reported to have been taken to hospital with no signs of breathing or heartbeat. The other two injured people were passengers on the bus.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok are among seven national security suspects who have their SAR passports cancelled as the government levied a fresh round of sanctions against them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui and Kwok, along with Kevin Yam, Yuan Gong-yi, Anna Kwok, Joey Siu and Frances Hui – who are all living overseas – were earlier placed on a wanted list, with the authorities offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information that leads to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang told a press conference on Tuesday that the public is banned from providing the absconders with money, handling their funds, engaging in property transactions or entering into commercial partnerships with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Kwok, Yam and Yuan also had their professional qualifications or company directorships in Hong Kong temporarily stripped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security minister added that the authorities have initiated court proceedings to seize the money raised by Ted Hui on online platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're processing with the confiscation of the crime proceeds against Hui, and the amount is around HK$800,000," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the passport cancellations are useful because the group won't be able to travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the authorities have placed six more people living overseas on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are scholar Chung Kim-wah, former district councillor Carmen Lau, former actor Joseph Tay, and activists Tony Chung, Victor Ho and Chloe Cheung.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security police said they're suspected of inciting secession on social media, calling for sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland officials, colluding with foreign forces, and promoting a so-called referendum to achieve self-determination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy police commissioner on national security, Andrew Kan, said officers are freezing their bank accounts, and that the public should not give them any money on online platforms.

 The Social Welfare Department on Tuesday said there's been a sharp increase in the number of people applying to become foster carers since a monthly allowance was more than doubled to around HK$11,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  The payment was increased in April, while those providing emergency care saw their allowance roughly double to HK$13,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsung Ka-yee, officer in charge at the department's central foster care unit, told an RTHK programme that there are now more than 1,000 foster families in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the incentive payments were increased on April 1 this year, the number of enquiries we've received has surged by more than 35 percent compared to last year," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the actual number of applicants we're processing, because some enquiries might not lead to an actual application, we're now handling around 20 percent more applications than a year ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carrie Kong, chief supervisor for foster care services at the Hong Kong Christian Service, said carers welcome the increased allowance as it gives them a sense of recognition for their work.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told the same programme that it still takes time to place children in a new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though there are more foster families, and it's become easier for us to look for suitable families to match with the children's needs, this doesn't mean that children in need can be admitted within a short period of time, because matching a child with a family involves many factors," she said.

    French PM: Mayotte death toll likely to be 'dozens'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Monday hit out at "alarmist" claims about a significant death toll from Cyclone Chido, which hit the country's Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think that it'll be in the dozens and not in the thousands," he told BFMTV. "I think the alarmist and sometimes terrifying figures that have been put forward won't be borne out in reality."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official death toll from the cyclone that hit the impoverished islands earlier this month is at least 35, with some 2,500 injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a local official of the French territory on December 15 estimated that there were "certainly several hundred" victims, speculating that the death toll could rise to "several thousand".
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the storm battered the remote archipelago, rumours have circulated about possible mass graves in hard-to-reach areas still inaccessible to rescue teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doubts about the actual toll are linked to the makeshift dwellings where most potential victims lived as well as the Muslim tradition of burying the dead within 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many inhabitants of the flimsy shantytowns that were destroyed in the storm came from the neighbouring Comoros.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron visited Mayotte last Thursday and said the number of victims would "likely" exceed the first official tolls. (AFP)

    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

    China vows cooperation over severed undersea cables

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has provided information and documents to a joint investigation into two severed Baltic Sea undersea cables, and has invited Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to participate in and complete the inquiry, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made the remarks at a news briefing when asked about a Financial Times report that Sweden had criticised China for refusing full access despite an open investigation, and for not allowing its public prosecutor to board the suspect ship, Yi Peng 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese bulk carrier is moving again after sitting still for more than a month in Danish waters, the Swedish Coastguard said on Saturday. China allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board the vessel for the investigation last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to cooperate with the investigation, the Yi Peng 3 has been suspended for a long period of time, and in order to safeguard the physical and mental health of the crew, the shipowner company has decided to resume its voyage after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with the parties concerned," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that China had notified all relevant countries in advance and was willing to maintain communication and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yi Peng 3 came under investigation following the breach in November of two fibre-optic cables - one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania - that raised suspicions of sabotage and concerns about the security of critical infrastructure. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's president said on Tuesday that a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market had cast a "dark shadow" over this year's celebrations but urged the nation not to be driven apart by extremists.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his traditional Christmas address, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier sought to issue a message of healing four days after the brutal attack in the eastern city of Magdeburg killed five people and left over 200 wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dark shadow hangs over this Christmas," said the head of state, pointing to the "pain, horror and bewilderment over what happened in Magdeburg just a few days before Christmas".
  <br>
  <br>
  He made a call for national unity as a debate about security and immigration is flaring again: "Hatred and violence must not have the final word. Let's not allow ourselves to be driven apart. Let's stand together."
  <br>
  <br>
  His words came a day after the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) held what it called a memorial rally for the victims in Magdeburg, where one speaker demanded that Germany "must close the borders".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby, an anti-extremist initiative was held under the motto "Don't Give Hate a Chance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Steinmeier recognised that there was a "great deal of dissatisfaction about politics" in Germany but insisted that "our democracy is and remains strong".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Saudi doctor, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was arrested Friday at the scene of the attack in which a rented SUV ploughed at high speed through the crowd of revellers, bringing death and chaos to the festive event.
  <br>
  <br>
  His motive remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdulmohsen has in his many online posts voiced strongly anti-Islam views, anger at German authorities and support for far-right conspiracy narratives on the "Islamisation" of Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi suspect has been remanded in custody in a top-security facility on five counts of murder and 205 of attempted murder, prosecutors said, but not on terrorism-related charges. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has capped off a historic 2024 by winning The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the third time, tying him with basketball great Michael Jordan. He trails only four-time winners Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods and LeBron James.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very honoured,” Ohtani said through translator Matt Hidaka. ”Obviously all the hard work has paid off. Maybe next year, I’ll get the award again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In balloting by 74 sports journalists from the AP and its members, Ohtani received 48 votes. He previously won the award in 2023 and 2021, when he was with the Los Angeles Angels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Japan, I did follow Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods,” he said. “I would see their accolades and how they were successful in the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP honour has been given out since 1931. Golfer Babe Didrikson won six times, the most by a man or woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimmer Léon Marchand of France, who won four gold medals at the Paris Olympics, was second with 10 votes in balloting announced Monday. Golfer Scottie Scheffler, whose victories this year included the Masters and an Olympic gold medal, was third with nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP Female Athlete of the Year will be announced on Wednesday. (AP)

    Arsenal's Saka sidelined 'weeks' with hamstring injury

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka will be sidelined for "many weeks" after suffering a hamstring injury in Arsenal's 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, with manager Mikel Arteta describing his loss as a "huge" blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The England winger went down midway through the first half at Selhurst Park on Saturday and had to be replaced by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not looking good. He will be out for many weeks," Arteta said at a press conference, adding he could not be more specific.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard said the loss of the 23-year-old, who has nine goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season, would force him into a rethink.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously he's a big player for us," he said. "You just have to see the impact that he has on the team, but it's going to be a really good exercise for all of us to think about ways to overcome another challenge – because we've already had a lot in the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said Saka was "gutted" and "really emotional" after discovering the extent of his injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that fellow winger Raheem Sterling had injured his knee and would be out for a number of weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to look internally at what we have and be creative," said the Gunners boss, adding that he did not know if the club would sign a winger in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was filmed leaving Selhurst Park on crutches, souring what had been a comprehensive second win over the Palace in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta, whose third-placed team face Premier League strugglers Ipswich on Saturday, said he was confident that Saka would be back well before the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the development of a player," Arteta said. "At some stage, at this level, you are going to get injured – unfortunately badly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could have been worse, it could have been something else that can take you out for a year," he added. "It's how you react to that, how you overcome that situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said he was "putting some ideas together" about how to cope in the winger's absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the congested fixture schedule had played a part in Saka's injury, Arteta said the issue was more to do with consistently high workloads over many seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, Bukayo and Declan (Rice), they played over 130 games in two seasons," he said. "So what's going to happen in the second one, the third one or the fourth one, if that continues the same way? It's unsustainable." (AFP)

    Probe finds Trump ally paid for underage sex

<div class="itemFullText">
 A former US lawmaker who was Donald Trump's first pick to run the Justice Department paid for sex numerous times, including with an underage girl, according to a congressional report released Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Matt Gaetz also regularly used cocaine and ecstasy, and bought marijuana from his Capitol Hill office, according to the 37-page document, the culmination of a long-running probe by the House Ethics Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favours or privileges, and obstruction of Congress," panel investigators wrote, according to reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing - pointing to the Justice Department's decision not to bring charges against him in 2023 after a criminal probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came out despite him suing the committee to block its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congressional investigators found that the 42-year-old broke multiple Florida laws on sexual misconduct, although they cleared him of federal sex trafficking violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report listed payments by Gaetz totalling more than US$90,000 to 12 women "likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use" between 2017 and 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-congressman was a staunch Trump loyalist and a favourite of the president-elect's ardent supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned from Congress in November after Trump nominated him for US attorney general. (AFP)

 England Test captain Ben Stokes faces at least three months out after tearing his left hamstring during the tour of New Zealand, team management announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder had already been ruled out of next year's Champions Trophy one-day international tournament in Pakistan and the preceding white-ball tour of India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further assessments have since revealed the full extent of the injury, with Stokes set to undergo surgery in January, said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes suffered the injury while bowling during the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes did not bat in the second innings of that match as England slumped to a 423-run defeat – a result that meant his side still won a three-match series 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  He previously missed this year's home series against Sri Lanka and the first Test in Pakistan after tearing the hamstring on the same left leg in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  England's next Test is at home to Zimbabwe in May. They will then host a five-match Test series against India starting in June, before their pinnacle 2025 to 2026 Ashes tour of Australia. (AFP)

 US markets shook off early weakness and pushed higher on Monday, propelled by gains in Nvidia and some other large tech equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had been under pressure early amid concerns over higher US Treasury bond yields that impede year-end gains in a historically strong period of the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stocks didn't really have any direction in the morning, then we got this tech rally that just sort of drifted higher all day," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.2 percent at 42,906.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,974.07, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.0 percent to 19,764.89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks dropped last week after the Federal Reserve signalled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the market rose progressively in a quiet session with analysts pointing to low pre-holiday trading volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among economic releases, US consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in December amid concerns over the potential economic drag of new tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consumer confidence index slipped to 104.7 in December, down from a revised 112.8 last month, The Conference Board announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualcomm climbed 3.5 percent after a jury sided with it in a legal dispute with Arm over alleged breach of license agreements connected to Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. Arm Holdings fell 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordstrom fell 1.6 percent after Mexican investment group El Puerto de Liverpool and members of the Nordstrom family reached a deal that involves taking the department store chain private. The transaction is valued at US$6.25 billion, Nordstrom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will have a half session on Tuesday, Christmas Eve, followed by Wednesday's holiday. (AFP)

    'Safety education must start from young age'

<img alt="Fay Siu says there should also be jail terms, and not just fines, for offenders in some serious cases. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784736_1_20241223221832.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims on Monday called for more safety education as it revealed a concerning trend in workplace fatalities and sudden deaths in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group reported 76 fatal workplace accidents across all sectors as of Monday this year, with nearly half registered in the construction industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty cases were classified as "sudden death at work", which were double the total figure from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safety awareness is lacking not only in the industry but also in Hong Kong society as a whole," said Venus Cheuk, an organiser from the association.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told RTHK that pre-employment training alone is insufficient to address the issue, adding that safety education should begin from childhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because since childhood, we have had a deficit in safety education, which naturally hindered the development of a safety mindset," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's chief executive, Fay Siu, felt that the penalties meted out to some employers convicted of breaching the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance lacked deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said apart from fines, there should also be jail terms for offenders in some serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the association said six deaths or serious industrial accidents occurred during the construction of the airport's third runway system, with some taking place at night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Airport Authority said it has always adhered to the highest construction safety standards, adding that the accident rate for the third runway system project was 6.41 per thousand workers, much lower than the industry average.

<img alt="The government says the Airport Authority has acknowledged procedural failures in reporting and investigation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784730_1_20241223212303.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has called on the Airport Authority to improve its reporting mechanism and enhance staff training, after the body did not immediately report an incident involving the automated people mover system last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Back in November 2023, a girl was suspected to have stumbled and fallen into the gap between the platform and the train. She was helped to safety by passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the incident only came to light 11 months later in October this year, with the government saying it was not notified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority was then ordered to submit a report within one month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Monday, the government said the authority acknowledged procedural failures in reporting and investigation, but added it found no evidence of a cover-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the the authority blamed a "lack of alertness in reporting and communication among the frontline staff", and as a result the incident was not "properly recorded" back then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary actions have since been taken against the staff involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government noted that airport officials have pledged to take steps to address the situation. These include organising training sessions to strengthen the incident notification mechanism, and enhancing the CCTV system at the platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department also confirmed that the people mover system is safe in both its design and operation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Catholic leader Stephen Chow has called on people to stay hopeful for the future in his Christmas message.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cardinal Chow said amid the slower-than-expected recovery of the global and local economies, wars and geopolitical tensions, people should continue to have faith - and be extra supportive to young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Christmas and the New Year are a time for hope, love, peace and dreams. Without hope and dreams there will be no future, especially for our young people. We need to walk alongside them and empower their creative hope and dreams," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal added everyone can step up to provide love and hope, especially to those who are going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can think of those who are struggling in war zones with seemingly endless torment, displaced persons and refugees looking for a dignified future, prisoners waiting for a new life, married couples who cannot see a sufficiently stable future for childbearing, young people who fail to identify convincing reasons to envisage a hopeful future, the elderly who are lonely and abandoned, and those who are sick and lonely in hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, the Archbishop of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, Andrew Chan, called for forgiveness, peace, reconciliation and service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how easy it is to be blinded and distracted by the visible wealth around us, but it is even easier to be blinded by the invisible power of this world. It is easy to say that with power, comes responsibility, but far too often we see people taking power and using it without holding back," he said in a video message.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is nothing more powerful than God, and what he does with that ultimate power is to love and forgive."

 US President Joe Biden on Monday commuted the death sentences of 37 of 40 federal inmates, taking action ahead of the return of Donald Trump, who oversaw a sweeping number of lethal injections during his first term.
 <br>
  <br>
  "These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my Administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder," Biden said in a statement, announcing the prisoners would serve life in prison without the possibility of parole. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said a new contactless channel at the Chung Ying Street checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok makes it easier for people to access the area and demonstrates Hong Kong's innovative technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Facial recognition technology allows people with valid Closed Area Permits to enter and exit Chung Ying Street without stopping to show their passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an opening ceremony, Chan said he believes the revamped checkpoint also offers a photo opportunity for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope to replace manual checks with innovative technology – making checkpoint access easier for people, increasing passenger capacity, and showcasing Hong Kong's digital capabilities as an international hub," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reprovisioned checkpoint also provides tourists with a new photo spot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard, an Ap Chau resident who buy groceries in Chung Ying Street every week, said the technology makes his life easier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's instant. I'm very impressed. Very advanced progress," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$50 million checkpoint features nostalgic elements including grey bricks, white pillars and wooden benches inspired by old railway stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edward Wong, a project director from the Architectural Services Department, said he hopes the building will attract tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get the memory of the old station that we have in the Sha Tau Kok spur line and also we get the memory of the old station," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have some characteristics, for example rusty rail lines, so we are creating some rusty walls here. So we have to show that we can have some hotspots for the tourists to take photos here."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker was killed in Sheung Shui on Monday after he was struck by falling metal pipes while he was unloading them from a lorry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the man, in his 70s, was injured at around 10am near Man Kok Village. He was taken to North District Hospital where he was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said it has classified the case as an industrial accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said officers were sent to the scene to investigate what happened.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man was on Monday sentenced to four years and a month behind bars for his role in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang Ka-man, a businessman, was found guilty last month of rioting and conspiracy to wounding with intent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, deputy District Court judge Amy Chan said the defendant was involved in the violence around Yuen Long MTR Station on July 21, 2019, as video footage showed he held a rattan stick and stood at the front of a 100-strong group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said the group had planned their attack as many of them were armed, which showed they were expecting the arrival of a rival group dressed in black.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan described the assault as effecting hatred, bullying, intimidation and silencing, saying the white-shirted group should have called the police instead of, as she put it, enforcing the law themselves or using violence to express dissatisfaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge added that while there was no evidence showing that Tang had caused injuries to those dressed in black, he provided help to others dressed in white and was at the scene to encourage others to take part in the rioting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan reduced the defendant's jail term by five months, saying he had agreed during trial that a riot had taken place and had been involved in charity.

    'Handle Real Madrid fan complaints individually'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on organisers of a meet-and-greet session with former Real Madrid stars to address complaints about last week's event individually.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, fans complained that they had paid HK$6,880 to meet the veteran players but were unable to get their autographs or take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it has received 16 complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident this time was special and has to be addressed in a more individual and targeted manner, because every case is different," the watchdog's chief executive, Gilly Wong, said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it was a big case involving lots of people, it might have to be handled in a standard manner. But here, each complainant's case can be addressed separately, and they can try to coordinate with the organisers."
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong told RTHK that by the time he was allowed into the meet-and-greet session, some of the players had already left.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he wasn't impressed with the organisers' efforts to make up for the disappointment, including the offer of a group photo before Real's game against Barcelona at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're obviously dissatisfied. Actually the arrangement just kept getting worse. The arrangement of a group photo was already not particularly good, and they couldn't even arrange a new autograph session afterwards. The incident made us really sad," he said, adding that he wants a full refund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event organisers have apologised, explaining that players left early to prepare for the match. A WhatsApp hotline has been set up for those unhappy with the arrangements.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Monday said it has issued two fixed penalty tickets and 33 written warnings to premises that have violated the ban on disposable plastic products since a grace period for the new law ended about two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said it received 62 complaints and reports about non-compliance and in 33 cases no action was taken to rectify problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EPD has issued written warnings requiring the persons-in-charge to make improvements within 10 working days; otherwise, a fixed penalty notice will be issued," a department spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two catering premises were found to be persistently violating the rules and were each issued a fixed penalty ticket of HK$2,000, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having reviewed the data in these two months after the adaptation period, most of the non-compliance had been rectified within a short period of time, and only two cases with repeated non-compliance records required the issuance of fixed penalty notices at present," the spokesman said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokić shook off a slow start to post a 27-point triple-double as the Nuggets rallied to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 132-129 in overtime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jokić, who claimed his third MVP in four years last season, added 13 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb star, who was held to six points in the first half, bemoaned another slow start for Denver – who trailed by as many as 17 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took a 111-109 lead on Julian Strawther's layup with just over four minutes left in regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  CJ McCollum put New Orleans back in front 119-117 with 53.2 seconds left in the fourth, but Denver guard Jamal Murray drilled a step-back basket with nine seconds to go to tie it at 119-119, and when McCollum missed a three-pointer they went to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokić took over in the extra session, scoring Denver's first six points as they handed the Pelicans a seventh straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seems like we just like it that way," Jokić said of the late heroics needed by the Nuggets. "But we should be more hungry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray also scored 27 points for Denver, and Russell Westbrook added 21 off the bench. Jordan Hawkins led New Orleans' scoring with 25 points and McCollum had 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers posted their fourth straight win in impressive style, powering away in the second half to beat the Kings 122-95 in Sacramento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam delivered a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds and the Pacers put up 70 points in the second half of a dominant victory in which seven Indiana players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Turner scored 15 points, star guard Tyrese Haliburton and reserve Ben Sheppard added 14 apiece and T.J. McConnell contributed 12 points and 10 assists off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We brought it from start to finish," Sheppard said. "The energy we brought, both the bench and the starters – it was a great team win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Point guard De'Aaron Fox scored 23 points to lead the Kings, and Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 21 rebounds – but Kings fans were booing as the team fell to a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough night for us," Kings coach Mike Brown said. "There are going to be nights when you don't have it offensively, but we can't give up 70 points in a half." (AFP)

 Shanghai authorities have partially reopened a metro line which was closed on Sunday morning after a train smashed into a fallen crane on the track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The train was badly damaged but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that following emergency repairs, Line 11 services heading towards Disney Resort Station resumed around half a day after the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency said a crane at a construction site snapped and fell onto the tracks, causing damage to rail network facilities as well as the train.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said on Sunday that weapons in the country, including those held by Kurdish-led forces, would come under state control.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa spoke alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, after earlier meeting with Lebanese Druze leaders and vowing to end "negative interference" in the neighbouring country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ankara-backed rebels played a key role in supporting Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed a rebel alliance that seized Damascus on December 8, toppling long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press conference with Fidan, Sharaa said Syria's armed "factions will begin to announce their dissolution and enter" the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control, whether from the revolutionary factions or the factions present in the SDF area", he added, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said "we are working on protecting sects and minorities from any attacks that occur between them" and from "external" actors exploiting the situation "to cause sectarian discord".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria is a country for all and we can co-exist together," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed more than half-a-million people and displaced more than half its population, with many of them fleeing to neighbouring countries, including three million in Turkey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey has maintained strong ties with Syria's new leaders, and has continued military operations against Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A small plane carrying 10 people crashed into shops in the centre of the tourist city of Gramado in southern Brazil on Sunday, killing everyone on board, state government officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The aircraft's owner and pilot, Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, died along with the other nine passengers, all of whom were members of his family, according to Rio Grande do Sul Governor Eduardo Leite.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement published on LinkedIn, Galeazzi's company, Galeazzi & Associados, confirmed that the 61-year-old was on the plane, adding that he was traveling with his wife, their three daughters, several other family members and another company employee, who perished in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 17 people on the ground were injured, Leite said at a press conference, with 12 still receiving hospital care, including two in a critical condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manufactured in 1990, the twin-engine Piper PA-42-1000 took off shortly after 9 am local time from nearby Canela airport and was heading to Jundiai in Sao Paulo state under unfavourable weather conditions, the governor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the cause of the crash is being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Centre (Cenipa).
  <br>
  <br>
  Nestled in a mountainous region, Gramado is the most popular tourist destination in Rio Grande do Sul, which was severely impacted earlier this year by unprecedented floods that claimed dozens of lives, destroyed infrastructure and significantly disrupted the state's economy. (Agencies)

    Panama rejects Trump's threat to retake Panama Canal

<img alt="Panama's president reaffirms his country's sovereignty over the Panama Canal after Donald Trump threatened to retake control. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784633_1_20241223090126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama's president Jose Raul Mulino on Sunday dismissed recent threats made by US President-elect Donald Trump to retake control of the Panama Canal over complaints of "unfair" treatment of American ships.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Every square metre of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama," Mulino said in a video posted to social media platform, X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino's public comments, though never mentioning Trump by name, come a day after the president-elect complained about the canal on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal was completed by the United States in 1914 and returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mulino rejected Trump's claims in his video message, though he also said he hoped to have "a good and respectful relationship" with the incoming administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power," Mulino said. "As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, Trump responded to Mulino's dismissal, writing on Truth Social: "We'll see about that!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tens of thousands of people streamed into a central square in Serbia's capital on Sunday for a rally against populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government, whose tight grip on power has been challenged by weeks of street protests led by university students.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rally at Belgrade's Slavija Square, one of the largest in recent years, was called by students and farmer unions. It was part of a wider movement demanding accountability over the November 1 collapse of a canopy at a railway station in the country's north that killed 15 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are all under the canopy,” read one of the banners displayed at the main Belgrade square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller rallies were also held in the cities of Nis and Kragujevac. The protest in Belgrade started with a 15-minute silence for the victims. Later, chants of “You have blood on your hands!” were heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a show of confidence, the Serbian president on Sunday inaugurated a section of a newly-built highway in central Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vucic said he wouldn't budge to opposition demands for a transitional government and accused his opponents of using students to try to seize power.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will beat them again,” said Vucic. “They (the opposition) don't know what to do but to use someone's children.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apparent attempt to defuse the student-led protests, Vucic has been advertising what he said are “favourable” loans for young people to purchase apartments as well as attracting tens of thousands of doctors and other skilled people who have left the Balkan country for a better life in the West in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors have arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public scepticism about the honesty of the investigation. (AP)

<img alt="A man has been apprehended in connection with the death of a woman who was set on fire while she was on a stationary subway train in New York City.

<div class="itemFullText">
 New York City police announced on Sunday that they had in custody a “person of interest” in the early morning death of a woman who was lit on fire by a man she didn't know on a subway train.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police apprehended the suspect after receiving a report from three high school students, who had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New Yorkers came through again,” said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tisch said the suspect and the woman, both of whom have not been identified, were riding a subway train without any interaction between them to the end of the line in Brooklyn at around 7.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the train came to a stop, surveillance video from the carriage showed the man “calmly” walk up to the victim, who was seated motionless, possibly sleeping, and set her clothing on fire with what appeared to be a lighter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman's clothing then “became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds,” Tisch said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers on a routine patrol discovered the woman on fire, standing in the middle of the carriage. She was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeknownst to the officers, the suspect was seated just outside the train car, on a bench on the platform, Tisch said. Body cameras worn by the officers caught a “very clear, detailed look” at the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had a lighter in his pocket when he was taken into custody, Tisch said. (Reuters)

    Last-gasp comeback lifts Commanders over Eagles

<img alt="Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels celebrates with teammate Olamide Zaccheaus (14). Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784627_1_20241223080808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw five touchdown passes on Sunday as the Commanders halted Philadelphia's 10-game NFL winning streak with a 36-33 victory in which the Eagles also lost quarterback Jalen Hurts to a concussion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders piled up 22 points in the fourth quarter, rookie signal-caller Daniels finding Jamison Crowder with a nine-yard touchdown pass with six seconds left to secure what had seemed an unlikely win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game's never over until the clock hits zero," Daniels said after a win that kept the Commanders' playoff hopes alive while eliminating Dallas and San Francisco from contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels awesome," Daniels added. "Everybody can enjoy their Christmas now."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You got those guys that came in on the win streak they were on, they were hot and they’re a very good team," he went on to say. "And rightfully so, good offense, good defence, all-around well-prepared team and you want to go out there and see where you match up against those type of guys."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles, who hadn't lost since September, were without Hurts for most of the game after he hit his head on the turf after a tackle in the first quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Pickett replaced him and threw for 143 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but at 12-3 the Eagles dropped out of a tie for best record in the NFC and failed to clinch the NFC East division title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions remained atop the NFC with a franchise-record 13th victory, cruising past the Bears 34-17 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stung by a loss to Buffalo that snapped their 11-game winning streak, the Lions jumped to a 20-point lead on the way to setting a single-season franchise record for points scored with 493 so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lios quarterback Jared Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, including an 82-yard TD pass to Jameson Williams, who had a career-high 143 receiving yards on five catches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, as the Lions used a trick play in which Goff pretended to stumble to spring tight end Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive of the second half. (AFP/AP)

    Mbappé strikes as Real Madrid down Sevilla

<img alt="Mbappé opened the scoring for Real Madrid, who recorded their twelfth straight victory in all competitions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784625_1_20241223074531.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé scored a screamer and set up another goal as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 4-2 on Sunday to move second in La Liga above stuttering rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Atlético Madrid beat Barca on Saturday to claim top spot at Christmas, Carlo Ancelotti's side also took advantage with a comfortable home win which leaves them a point behind the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Ancelotti said ahead of Sevilla's visit that Mbappé's adaptation period had ended following his summer switch from Paris Saint-Germain and the French forward proved the coach right with a strong performance and his 14th goal of the season across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fede Valverde also netted a brilliant effort from range, with Rodrygo Goes and Brahim Diaz on the scoresheet for the hosts too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio scored for Sevilla, although they were thoroughly outplayed on veteran defender Jesus Navas' final game for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that we know each other better, my arrival changed a lot of things, and now, as the coach said, the adaptation is over and I feel very good in the team," Mbappé said. "We can see on the pitch that I click better with my team-mates and now we're all playing better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé, back after a brief absence with a thigh injury, scored for Madrid in midweek as they won the Intercontinental Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was welcome relief for the forward after missing two penalties in recent weeks against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, as well as suffering criticism for his form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I've got much more in my legs than I'm showing, but in the last games I've played better," Mbappé added. "The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom, I missed a penalty and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinícius Júnior suspended, Mbappé took the reins and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as Madrid brought the ball out from the back and worked it to Rodrygo on the left flank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian squared to Mbappé on the edge of the area, who took one touch to control, another to set himself and with his third, smashed a fierce effort past the helpless Álvaro Fernández.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's second, 10 minutes later, was even better, with Valverde firing a screamer into the top corner from over 30 yards out after a short corner routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti's side were in full flow and the third followed in the 34th minute when Lucas Vázquez crossed for Rodrygo, who finished with aplomb. (AFP)

    Brazil's Fonseca captures Next Gen ATP Finals crown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joao Fonseca became the second youngest champion of the NextGen ATP tournament on Sunday when he defied his lowly ranking of 145 to defeat Learner Tien in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Fonseca, 18, came through 2-4, 4-3 (10/8), 4-0, 4-2 to see off his left-handed American opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the youngest champion at the event since current world number one Jannik Sinner claimed the title also at the age of 18 five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult," Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with tennis legend Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a final against Learner in juniors at the 2023 US Open and I know the way he can play," he added. "He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca, the lowest-ranked player in the eight-man field, won all five matches he played this week at the Red Sea venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began the year ranked at 730 in the world and having made a maiden ATP quarter-final in Rio this year, he will be aiming to make significant progress in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to believe when I go before a tournament that I can win," Fonseca said. "But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool swept four points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah's masterclass inspired a memorable 6-3 rout of Tottenham, while Manchester United crashed to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah delivered a sublime performance featuring two goals and a pair of assists as Arne Slot's side ran riot in north London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old is now Liverpool's fourth top scorer ever with 229 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's brace took him past Billy Liddell, with only Ian Rush (346), Roger Hunt (285) and Gordon Hodgson (241) ahead of him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds have won 21 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Slot and have a game in hand on Chelsea to strengthen their lead in the title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a remarkable display of Liverpool's firepower as Luis Díaz and Alexis Mac Allister scored to put them in command.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 60 minutes we did everything we had to do, we were comfortable and good with the ball – the main thing is we worked very hard," Slot said. "But you have to be on top of your game for the whole game and we didn't do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke scored for Tottenham, but an eighth league defeat this season leaves them languishing in 11th place as the pressure mounts on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you want to discount the fact we're missing a goalkeeper, two centre-backs and a left-back and that hasn't coincided with how we're doing – I don't know what to say anymore," Postecoglou said of his critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim, who once again left Marcus Rashford out of his squad, is set for a miserable Christmas following the worst result of his brief reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Languishing in 13th place, United have suffered four defeats in nine matches in all competitions since Amorim arrived from Sporting Lisbon in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's second successive loss after their League Cup exit at Tottenham on Thursday underlined Amorim's belief that their road back to the top will be long and arduous.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who have conceded first in their last six games, were booed off at half-time, while the final whistle was greeted by more jeers from the few fans who stayed until the bitter end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous – I felt it in the stadium," Amorim said. "We have to suffer again, but we will try to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's decision to play without Rashford for the third consecutive game will face fresh scrutiny after United's wretched performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim surprisingly omitted the 27-year-old England forward from the squad for United's win at Manchester City last weekend, prompting Rashford to hint he was willing to leave the club for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford was at Old Trafford wearing a United tracksuit amid his extended exile, as Amorim made six changes from the line-up beaten 4-3 by Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese world number five Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the season-opening United Cup on Sunday citing the need for more rest, but plans to be at the Australian Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old is coming off a breakthrough season that reaped three singles titles, with the highlight winning Olympic gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also made her first Grand Slam final, at Melbourne Park, losing in straight sets to current world number one Aryna Sabalenka on the back of playing the mixed-teams United Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng has opted for more rest this time ahead of the season-opening major from January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the long season that 2024 was for me, I need a few extra weeks of rest, recovery, and good training to get ready for the new season," she wrote on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had such a fantastic time at the United Cup in January of this year, and therefore will miss the event greatly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still, I'm so excited to be back in Australia soon and I will see you all in Melbourne in a couple of weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  China begin their United Cup campaign against Brazil in Perth on Friday, leaving world No.175 Gao Xinyu as their top-ranked woman. (AFP)

 Incoming US president Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for US ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as US businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama took full control in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else," Trump said. "We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!"
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued that if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for US business interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated five percent of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the US East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly US$5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP)

    Putin vows 'destruction' after Kazan drone strike

<img alt="Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784590_1_20241222194935.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed to bring more "destruction" to Ukraine in retaliation for a drone attack on the central Russian city of Kazan a day earlier.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia accused Ukraine of a "massive" drone attack that hit a luxury apartment block in the city, some 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the frontier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos on Russian social media networks showed drones hitting a high-rise glass building and setting off fireballs, though there were no reported casualties as a result of the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whoever, and however much they try to destroy, they will face many times more destruction themselves and will regret what they are trying to do in our country," Putin said during a televised government meeting on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin was addressing the local leader of Tatarstan, the region where Kazan is located, in a road-opening ceremony via video link.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike on Kazan was the latest in a series of escalating aerial attacks in the nearly three-year conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has not commented on the strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin has previously threatened to target the centre of Kyiv with a hypersonic ballistic missile in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the defence ministry has called Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities over recent weeks retaliatory hits for Kyiv using Western-supplied missiles to hit Russian air bases and arms factories.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest threat comes as Russia claimed fresh advances on the battlefield in east Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry said on Telegram that its troops had "liberated" the villages of Lozova in the northeastern Kharkiv region and Krasnoye -- called Sontsivka in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is close to the resource hub of Kurakhove, which Russia has almost encircled and would be a key prize in Moscow's attempt to capture the entire Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has accelerated its advance across eastern Ukraine in recent months, looking to secure as much territory as possible before US President-elect Donald Trump comes to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has promised to bring a swift end to the nearly three-year-long conflict, without proposing any concrete terms for a ceasefire or peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow's army claims to have seized more than 190 Ukrainian settlements this year, with Kyiv struggling to hold the line in the face of manpower and ammunition shortages. (AFP)

    Some minor works could be exempted in future: Linn

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development minister Bernadette Linn said she expects at least a third of the 36,000 illegal housing structures subject to removal orders to be exempted, if legal amendments to the Buildings Ordinance are passed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials are proposing to allow certain unauthorised minor works to be kept if they have been checked and proven safe by approved professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan is to let officials focus on taking enforcement action against serious violations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme on Sunday, Linn said the checking fee by authorised experts should cost several thousand dollars on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government is planning to give homeowners a grace period of three years – after the new laws are passed – to complete the inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Buildings Department is conducting an analysis on this. It's possible that a third or half of these outstanding removal orders involve minor illegal structures," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means that at least 10,000 of these orders could be subject to checks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said items that could be exempted in future include enclosed balconies as well as flagpoles that are relatively small in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legal amendments also include tougher penalties for serious and major illegal structures, as well as a lower prosecution threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief added that under the proposed new rules, people who inherit unauthorised works from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain period of time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said this means that going forward, homebuyers should pay greater attention and exercise more caution when making a purchase.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal is due to begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police announced on Sunday that they have arrested and charged a 46-year-old man on suspicion of burglary and attempted burglary in connection with a string of cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Lau Wing-lam said the suspect is believed to have broken into 11 kindergartens, a construction site and an office in New Territories and Kowloon between May and this month, taking away cash and electronic gadgets worth over HK$230,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigation found that the man had acted alone. He pried open door locks or window frames using hard objects during the early hours of the day, and ransacked the place to steal cash and some electronic gadgets, such as computers, phones, and cameras," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The schools reported losses of more than HK$180,000 between them -- including HK$150,000 in cash -- while the construction site and office lost items worth about HK$43,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they’ve been able to recover some of those items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man is due to appear at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Sunday said the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has given restaurants a much-needed boost over winter solstice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said most eateries did “quite well” on Saturday night, with the sector recording nearly HK$400 million in sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Especially for Chinese restaurants, they can do two rounds of business, this has been quite good. Compared to last year, business has grown by about eight percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Some hotspots, like Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and some other areas, were crowded with people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also revealed that he's expecting a 10 percent growth in sales over the Christmas and New Year period, with an anticipated surge in visitors from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong can provide the kind of atmosphere for Christmas. When we see that all the shopping malls and even the streets [are] filled with Christmas atmosphere, then people from the mainland would rather come to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The catering representative said he hopes travellers can stay in the SAR for a longer period of time to further boost the local economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A train was badly damaged after it crashed into a crane in Shanghai on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  No one was injured in the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage circulating online apparently captured the dramatic moment, when the moving train – running at full speed – collided with the crane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos also showed the train suffering a substantial level of damage, with shattered glass all over the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that the crane had "intruded" into the track and damaged facilities on route 11 of the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said repairs are expected to take a considerable amount of time because of the complicated situation at the scene, adding that commuters should take other modes of transportation.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to mainland media, two cranes were lifting a steel frame just after 8am, when one of them suddenly snapped and hit the moving train.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784566_1_20241222130127.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that the government will roll out more innovative products, systems and cross-border cooperation to boost the capacity and liquidity of the SAR's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to comments from President Xi Jinping that both Hong Kong and Macau need to continue to expand global connections and enhance their attractiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi made the remarks when he attended the ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Macau SAR on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other things, the President also said the SARs have to accelerate their integration into the country's development plan, and play an even better connecting role in the new development paradigm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong therefore needs to promote more innovation, such as allowing the mainland to connect with more new emerging markets, while strengthening cooperation with traditional markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The higher liquidity and capacity of the Hong Kong market can better satisfy the fundraising needs of firms and organisations amid the geo-political situation and technological advancement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that while the country is facing challenges such as protectionism and unilateralism, it remains unwavering in promoting policies for high-level bilateral opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  To this end, Chan said Hong Kong -- as "a super-connector and super value-adder" -- will be even more proactive in encouraging multilateral exchanges and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will join hands with what he called other brother cities in the Greater Bay Area to go on roadshows and seek foreign investment, and create more win-win business opportunities.

    Airport crowded as people leave HK for Christmas

 The Hong Kong International Airport said on Sunday that it is stepping up services as people begin to fly out for the Christmas break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Long queues snaked around check-in counters at Chek Lap Kok, with many travellers saying they’re excited to take a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, surnamed Koo, told RTHK she’s off to Thailand for a warm Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five of us are joining a meditation camp there, then I'll visit Bangkok and Pattaya for six days. There's not much to do in Hong Kong. The atmosphere here isn't too good because people tend to go home early," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we go out to Mongkok, I go home when it starts turning dark, probably because of the habits we picked up during the pandemic. But when we're away from the city, we stay up later because the atmosphere is better.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kwok family, meanwhile, said they’re looking forward to a white Christmas in Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Osaka! We're so happy! It's so much fun there - and we're going to Universal Studios Japan!" the son said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We bought the tickets way ahead, and we want our kids to experience Christmas somewhere different. If it snows, our kids will be able to look at the natural scenery," the father added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority is advising people to travel to the airport via public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had said earlier that it’s expecting to handle around 200,000 passengers daily over the Christmas period, reaching pre-pandemic levels.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday he has appointed television executive Mark Burnett, who produced the tycoon's reality show "The Apprentice", as special envoy to the United Kingdom, one of Washington's closest allies.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role," the Republican leader posted on his social media platform Truth Social.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnett's role will be different from that of ambassador and does not need US Senate confirmation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mark will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities and cultural exchanges," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early this month Trump nominated Warren Stephens, a top Republican donor and billionaire investment banker, to be US ambassador to Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy Award-winning Burnett, who was born in London, is the creator of "Survivor", the reality competition series that became a US television juggernaut after its premiere in 2000. He has also produced other hit shows including "Shark Tank" and "The Voice".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also served as chairman of MGM Worldwide Television Group from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His biggest success was with "The Apprentice", the American reality program that aired on NBC under various formats for 15 seasons beginning in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show was widely credited with reversing Trump's fortunes and making him a household name in the United States before he announced his presidential run in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'The Apprentice' mythologised him anew, and on a much bigger scale, turning him into an icon of American success," a profile of Burnett in The New Yorker magazine stated in 2018. (AFP)

    Usyk one of the world's greats after Fury win

<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk reacts after his fight against Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784549_1_20241222081918.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk won his heavyweight championship rematch against Tyson Fury by unanimous decision on Saturday to stay unbeaten across two divisions and underline his right to be counted as one of the all-time greats.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian, who forced the pace and repeatedly tagged Fury with his accurate left hook, was awarded the fight 116-112 by all three judges, handing Fury his second straight loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usyk's win takes him to 23-0 with 14 knockouts and extends one of the all-time best careers that includes Olympic gold and undisputed champion at cruiserweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great fighter, it's a great performance," Usyk, 37, said of Fury, who was unbeaten over 35 fights until he lost their four-belt unification bout in May. "Unbelievable 24 rounds for my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the WBA, WBO and WBC belts were on the line this time after Usyk, focused on the lucrative rematch, relinquished his IBF title rather than face challenger Daniel Dubois.
  <br>
  <br>
  By beating Fury seven months ago, "The Cat" had already joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight, and the first of the four-belt era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat opens up an uncertain future for the 36-year-old Fury, now 34-2-1, who announced his retirement in 2022 only to change his mind and return to the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury, wearing a Santa-style red-and-white robe and bushy beard, appeared to Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You", before a determined-looking Usyk strode out in Cossack gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 6ft 9ins (206cm) Briton's jab held Usyk at bay early on and he landed a jarring right in round two. Usyk caught Fury flush with a left as he raised the pace in round three.
  <br>
  <br>
  They went toe-to-toe in a punishing fifth round, with Fury pummelling body shots while Usyk launched a flurry to the head. In the sixth, he stung Fury with a clean shot to the nose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supremely fit Usyk, renowned for taking charge in the closing rounds, was the aggressor in the seventh, tagging Fury with a hook as the "Gypsy King" backed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury regained the initiative in the ninth, wielding his jab and one-two combinations and leaning on the Ukrainian, utilising his career-heaviest 281lb (127.4kg) of weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was see-saw stuff as they traded blows but Usyk rocked Fury in the 11th with a lightning combination that ended with yet another left hook to the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Usyk uppercut to Fury's chin highlighted a furious final round and there was little doubt about the winner as the Ukrainian sank to his knees, arms aloft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports put the prize purse at US$190 million, with Usyk, as defending champion, expected to receive the bigger share -- a reversal of fortunes from May.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight sits high in the portfolio of Saudi Arabia's oil-funded push into sports, which has drawn accusations of "sportswashing" its dubious human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Formula One, the LIV Golf tour, Newcastle United and a swathe of ageing football stars, the kingdom's strategy confirmed its crowning moment this month when it was awarded football's 2034 World Cup. (AFP)

    Stellantis backtracks over planned Jeep layoffs

<img alt="Stellantis brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784548_1_20241222073225.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stellantis confirmed on Saturday it was reversing a decision to lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep plant in the US state of Ohio, following the ouster of embattled chief executive Carlos Tavares.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No employees will be placed on indefinite layoff on January 5, 2025, due to the previously announced shift reduction. Employees are expected to return to work as scheduled after the new year," a Stellantis spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes as "Stellantis continues to reassess its strategy in North America," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automaker had announced the job cuts at the plant in Toledo, Ohio in early November, saying it was part of an effort to "regain its competitive edge" amid struggles with falling sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, a 14-brand group that includes Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat, had planned to trim operations at the Toledo South Assembly Plant from two shifts to one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 400 employees were to be transferred to a "third-party service provider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis sales sank in the third quarter, with a 42 percent drop in North America alone. The group offered promotional deals as US dealerships struggled to reduce their inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stellantis has significantly revised its approach since Tavares's December 1 exit, with the new interim CEO giving guarantees to the French and Italian governments on maintaining its production and investments in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French-Italian-American company had 258,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2003. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to their ninth defeat in 12 matches at Aston Villa on Saturday as Arsenal dismantled Crystal Palace 5-1 to reignite their Premier League title charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest stormed Brentford's fortress to briefly climb to third in the table and Alexander Isak scored his first hat-trick in the English top flight as Newcastle ran riot at Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola -- in the worst spell of his managerial career -- made multiple changes following last week's painful derby defeat to Manchester United but it was to no avail as his injury-hit side lost 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season to put Villa ahead in the 16th minute and Morgan Rogers doubled the advantage for the impressive home side in the 65th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden scored his first top-flight goal of the season in stoppage time but it proved too little too late for the flailing champions, whose spark has vanished.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost six Premier League games in the current campaign, twice as many as they suffered during the whole of last season, when they were crowned champions for the fourth time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola said he trusted his players to turn things around despite their shocking run of just one win from their past 12 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys," he told the BBC. "Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bullish Mikel Arteta said Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, are now firmly in the title picture after his team's thumping win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, scored two more against the same opponents and there were also goals for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and substitute Declan Rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third-placed Gunners are just three points behind Liverpool, who are in action at Tottenham on Sunday, but Arne Slot's men have played two games fewer. Chelsea are in second spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one stage earlier this month Liverpool had a yawning nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not even halfway so we're going to try and set something. For us it's on," Arteta told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to enjoy Christmas with my family because when you win it's always better," added the Spaniard, whose side have finished as Premier League runners-up for the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest won their third consecutive Premier League match to keep up their push for European football, condemning Brentford to their first home defeat this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ola Aina slotted home the opener towards the end of the first half and Anthony Elanga made it 2-0 early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's about enjoying the moment," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "It's a very hard competition. Every game is so difficult and the next one is going to be very tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very proud of all the things we've been able to achieve, but we've achieved nothing yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle deepened Ipswich's plight and lifted themselves to seventh in the table with a 4-0 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak volleyed Eddie Howe's team ahead in the first minute and Jacob Murphy doubled Newcastle's lead before Isak side-footed in from close range just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden international scored his third nine minutes into the second half, poking the ball home after more fine work from Murphy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a ninth defeat in 17 games for Ipswich since they returned to the Premier League and they remain in the relegation zone, two points from safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mats Wieffer gave Brighton a 51st-minute lead against West Ham at the London Stadium but Mohammed Kudus equalised seven minutes later and the match finished 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Away from Saturday's action, Premier League basement club Southampton named former Roma and Torino boss Ivan Juric as their new manager, replacing the sacked Russell Martin. (AFP)

    Scholz mourns 5 killed, 200 wounded in car-ramming

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday visited the site of a car-ramming attack on a crowded Christmas market that killed five people and injured more than 200 as he called for unity while condemning the "terrible catastrophe."
 <br>
  <br>
  Police arrested a 50-year-old Saudi doctor of psychiatry at the scene, next to the battered BMW SUV that had ploughed through the festive crowd on Friday night, leaving a trail of carnage and bloodied casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sombre Scholz, dressed in black, was joined by national and regional politicians in the eastern city of Magdeburg, where they laid flowers outside the main church.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pledged that Germany would respond "with the full force of the law" to the attack but also called for unity as Germany has been rocked by a heated debate on immigration and security as it heads towards elections in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left chancellor said it was important "that we stick together, that we link arms, that it is not hatred that determines our coexistence but the fact that we are a community that seeks a common future."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was grateful for expressions of "solidarity ... from many, many countries around the world" and added that "it is good to hear that we as Germans are not alone in the face of this terrible catastrophe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourning and bereaved residents had already left candles, flowers and children's toys at the Johanneskirche church, where a memorial service was planned at 7:00 pm (1800 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  As Germany was reeling from the shocking attack, which came eight years after a jihadist strike on a Berlin Christmas market claimed 13 lives, more details emerged about the Saudi man under arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named by German media as Taleb A, he was a doctor who had lived in Germany since 2006 and held a permanent residence permit, working in a clinic near Magdeburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had long also worked as a rights activist who supported Saudi women and described himself as a "Saudi atheist". He had voiced strongly anti-Islam views, echoing the rhetoric of the far-right, according to his social media posts and past interviews.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his views expressed online grew more radical, he accused Germany's past governments of a plan to "Islamise Europe" and voiced fears he was being targeted by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bild daily reported that an initial drug test had proved positive, after police officers on Friday used a test kit that can detect narcotics ranging from cannabis to cocaine and methamphetamines. (AFP)

 Ten people, including four children, have been killed in a stampede in Nigeria’s capital city as a large crowd gathered to collect food items distributed by a local church at a Christmas event, the police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stampede occurred in the early morning hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, a high-brow part of Abuja, from where more than 1,000 people have been evacuated, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second such stampede in a week in Africa’s most populous country as local organisations, churches and individuals are increasingly organising charity events ahead of Christmas amid the country’s worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cyclone Chido, which ravaged the French archipelago of Mayotte, has claimed 76 lives in Mozambique, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chido made landfall in Mozambique on Sunday after tearing through the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte where hundreds of people are feared to have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone struck Mozambique in northern Cabo Delgado province and destroyed nearly 62,000 homes, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shelter, food and Non-food items (NFIs) - particularly hygiene kits, dignity kits, soap and mosquito nets are identified as being the most urgent needs for the affected population," the International Organisation for Migration said in a statement. (AFP)

 George Eastham, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, has died at the age of 88, his former club Stoke City announced on their website on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eastham, whose father also named George once played for England, won 19 caps for his country between 1963 and 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not play in England's 1966 campaign on home soil but the Blackpool-born winger was part of Alf Ramsey's squad that lifted the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham made 124 and 207 league appearances for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively before moving to Stoke in 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years earlier he had been involved in a court case against the so-called 'slavery contracts' which improved players' freedom to move between clubs and duly reformed the British transfer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Stoke City Football Club family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88," his former club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham represented the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley," said Stoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  After retiring, Eastham tried his hand at management, taking charge of Stoke for a short spell in the late 1970s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later emigrated to South Africa where he was a football coach for local black children. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai national was sentenced to death and two Germans were handed life sentences for the gruesome murder of a German real estate broker near the resort town of Pattaya, Thai media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Pattaya Provincial Court delivered the death sentence to Shahrukh Karim Uddin, a Thai of Pakistani descent, on Friday for the murder of Peter Ralter Mack, 62, in July 2023, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack's dismembered body was found inside a freezer covered in a thick layer of tape at a residence in an outer Pattaya suburb in southern Thailand's Chonburi province.
  <br>
  <br>
  German nationals Olaf Thorsten Brinkmann and Petra Christl Grundgreif confessed to the crime during the trial and their sentences were reduced from capital punishment to life in prison as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were found guilty of premeditated murder and concealing a body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mack disappeared after telling his wife he was meeting another property realtor, although his family later believed he had been lured away and kidnapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard evidence that the group planned to dispose of Mack's body at sea and transferred 3.35 million baht (US$98,000) out of his bank account. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    Thousands celebrate winter solstice at Stonehenge

<img alt="Research suggests Stonehenge may have had political as well as spiritual significance. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784513_1_20241221183146.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of tourists, pagans, druids and people simply yearning for the promise of spring marked the dawn of the shortest day of the year at the ancient Stonehenge monument on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Revellers cheered and beat drums as the sun rose at 8:09 am (0809 GMT) over the giant standing stones on the winter solstice – the shortest day and the longest night in the Northern Hemisphere. No one could see the sun through the low winter cloud, but that did not deter a flurry of drumming, chanting and singing as dawn broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be less than eight hours of daylight in England on Saturday – but after that, the days get longer until the summer solstice in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solstices are the only occasions when visitors can go right up to the stones at Stonehenge, and thousands are willing to rise before dawn to soak up the atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stone circle, whose giant pillars each took 1,000 people to move, was erected starting about 5,000 years ago by a sun-worshipping Neolithic culture. Its full purpose is still debated: Was it a temple, a solar calculator, a cemetery, or some combination of all three?
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper published in the journal Archaeology International, researchers from University College London and Aberystwyth University said the site on Salisbury Plain, about 128 kilometres southwest of London, may have had political as well as spiritual significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  That follows from the recent discovery that one of Stonehenge’s stones – the unique stone lying flat at the centre of the monument, dubbed the “altar stone” – originated in Scotland, hundreds of miles north of the site. Some of the other stones were brought from the Preseli Hills in southwest Wales, nearly 240 kilometres to the west,
  <br>
  <br>
  Lead author Mike Parker Pearson from UCL’s Institute of Archaeology said the geographical diversity suggests Stonehenge may have served as a "monument of unification for the peoples of Britain, celebrating their eternal links with their ancestors and the cosmos." (AFP)

    Pakistan Taliban claim raid killing 16 soldiers

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummelled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault," he said. "The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometres from the Afghan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged "in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pakistani Taliban – known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a UN Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there – and said "the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the Afghan Taliban show "ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants. (AFP)
