<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka praised on Friday the WTA's mission to highlight the personalities of its athletes and called Saudi Arabia's investment in the women's tennis tour an important part of growing the game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WTA rebranding, complete with a new logo and "Rally the world" tagline, comes amid a rise in global viewership and a record US$4.8 million prize awarded last year to Coco Gauff for winning the WTA Finals in Riyadh, a tournament sponsored by Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot. We needed this refreshing moment for so long," Sabalenka told Reuters at a WTA-hosted cocktail party in Hollywood celebrating the tour's new look and mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big move and I hope it's going to help our sport to get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, a big-serving Belarusian who grew up admiring the power games of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, said giving fans a more intimate look at the stars of the tour would pay off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The WTA should show our personalities and what it takes to become a top athlete," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have to be an inspiration for the younger generation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Announced in May, the multi-year partnership with PIF marked the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership amid criticisms of the Gulf nation's human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been there a lot and they have passion for sport. Their help means a lot for us," Sabalenka said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support is very important for the WTA. I think all of us will be very grateful for their support."
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's ATP Tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" last year with PIF, which has pumped huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Search teams in northern India on Saturday attempted to rescue 22 workers believed to be trapped after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials and local media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp near a village on the border with Tibet in Chamoli district on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said "relief and rescue operations have been accelerated" with the weather in the area clearing up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every effort is being made to safely evacuate all the workers trapped in the snow as soon as possible," Dhami said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the snow buried 55 workers initially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Army doctors at the site performed life-saving surgery on those critically injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season. (AFP)

    Hackman likely dead for nine days before being found

<img alt="Gene Hackman was a two-time Academy Award winner and credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing. (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793774_1_20250301120931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hollywood legend Gene Hackman had likely been dead for over a week when he and his wife were found lifeless in their New Mexico home, the local sheriff said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched a probe into what they said were the "suspicious" deaths of Hackman, 95, and his classical pianist wife Betsy Arakawa, 63, as questions swirl over how the actor could have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza told reporters that the partially mummified bodies had no external injuries but initial tests revealed "both individuals had tested negative for carbon monoxide."
  <br>
  <br>
  But, said Mendoza, tests had begun to narrow down a possible date of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An initial interrogation was conducted of Mr Hackman's pacemaker. This revealed that his last event was recorded on February 17, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of the Oscar-winning star of "The French Connection" and his wife were found on Wednesday, after emergency services were called to the scene when maintenance workers had been unable to access the sprawling property.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Arakawa's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses next to his body, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A German Shepherd was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendoza said as they waited for the results of toxicology tests, which might shed some light on the tablets by Arakawa's body, investigators were now trying to piece together a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included looking through planners and cell phones and searching for any video that might give hints to the couple's movements over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, he said, it was a complicated task, compounded by their low profile.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances of everyman characters inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. (AFP)

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan says salaries are the government's biggest expense. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793772_1_20250301115542.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said his proposal to freeze civil servant pay aims to show the government's determination in achieving a fiscal balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, he proposed cutting recurrent government expenditure by two per cent for the coming financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some lawmakers and political parties suggested deeper cuts of five to 10 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK programme that salaries were the government's biggest expense, and it was best to take a cautious approach to any cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make some adjustments in this area, while maintaining the level of public services. Even when training staff to use technology, it takes time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that reducing recurrent expenditure by two per cent annually is more appropriate. If we move too quickly, haste makes waste and the results may not be as good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief reiterated that he didn't want to rely too heavily on land income, citing the tremendous financial pressure on residents when land and property prices soared in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want housing to be as expensive as it was during times of short supply. So we'll continue our work on land supply. As for releasing prepared land, we can be flexible and take market conditions into consideration."
  <br>
  <br>
  On plans to roll out eight residential plots in the coming year, Chan said land sale plans shouldn't be linked to land premium income and this year's housing supply shouldn't be excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said the government would expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that many mainland enterprises had expressed an interest in its development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infrastructure investment for the Northern Metropolis has increased from HK$90 billion to HK$120 billion annually.

    Jos Buttler quits as England's white-ball captain

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jos Buttler resigned as England white-ball captain on Friday after his team made an early exit from the Champions Trophy with back-to-back defeats against Australia and Afghanistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team," Buttler said. "Hopefully somebody else who can come in alongside Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) will take the team to where it needs to be.”
  <br>
  <br>
  England lost two high-scoring games in Lahore and conceded the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 against Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler said he would lead England for the final time against South Africa in the last group match at Karachi.
  <br>
  <br>
  England had a disastrous preparation for the Champions Trophy when it won only one of its eight white-ball matches against India before arriving in Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overriding emotions are still sadness and disappointment,” Buttler said while expressing his willingness to continue representing England as a player.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure, in time, that (disappointment) will pass and I can get back to really enjoying my cricket, and (will) also be able to reflect on what an immense honour it is to captain your country and all the special things that come with it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler replaced Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball captain in 2022 and only months later won the T20 World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a sharp decline in England’s white-ball cricket with three unimpressive runs at the 2023 World Cup in India, 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies and now the Champions Trophy. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan was battling its largest wildfire in more than three decades on Saturday, one of several blazes that have killed one person and forced the evacuation of more than a thousand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flames are estimated to have spread over about 1,200 hectares in the forest of Ofunato in the northern region of Iwate since fire broke out on Wednesday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still examining the size of the affected area, but it is the biggest since the 1992 wildfire in Kushiro, Hokkaido, an agency spokesman told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire burned 1,030 hectares, the previous record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1,700 firefighters were being mobilised from across the country, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK showed white smoke billowing up and covering an entire mountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police found the body of one person who had been burned on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 1,000 nearby residents have been evacuated and more than 80 buildings had been damaged as of Friday, according to the Ofunato municipality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the blaze remained unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other fires were also burning Saturday, one in Yamanashi and another elsewhere in Iwate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ofunato has seen only 2.5 millimetres of rainfall this month - on course to fall far below the previous record low for February of 4.4 millimetres in 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year was Japan's hottest since records began. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity grew in February after a dip the previous month, official figures showed on Saturday, as the United States targets the country's exports with increased tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a key measure of industrial output - came in at 50.2 in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), above the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  February's reading was up from 49.1 in January, when factory activity shrank for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production was boosted in February by the "gradual resumption of work by enterprises after the Chinese New Year," said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the services sector, came in at 50.4 in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has admitted the country's economy still faces "numerous difficulties".
  <br>
  <br>
  China's leadership convenes next week for the "Two Sessions" meetings, where analysts expect them to hammer out plans to shield the economy from tariffs and trade threats from the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump this week announced an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said it remained to be seen "how much will the US raise tariff next week, (and) how damaging will it be for China's export orders". (AFP)

 Users will be able to check the remaining number of discounted trips using an Octopus card reader when changes to the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy take effect, the labour and welfare chief Chris Sun said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced in the latest Financial Budget that there would be a cap of 240 trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that, while the flat rate of HK$2 remains for rides costing HK$10 or less, the government will only shoulder 80 percent of the cost if the standard fare exceeds HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun noted that all 17,000 Octopus card readers in the SAR only allowed users to check the last 40 transactions and the remaining value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important for them to check whenever they want to check it - how many trips are remaining for that month. Right now, for the Octopus card they are holding, this is not a function with it. So we have to create that function for them to check it out," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, they have to go to... most likely one of the machines installed in most of the MTR stations where they can check their balance and also the recent transactions. So through that, what we call 'an Octopus card checker', when they just tap the card, they can check how many trips are still remaining for that month."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the government aims to put the changes in place no later than September next year, Sun emphasised that he hopes the amendment can take effect as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He says he believes the new measures will help tackle the issue of commuters taking long-haul rides for only short trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister emphasised that the government would reach out to elderly in, what he called, a "very, very extensive way", to ensure they were aware of the tweaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated that the impact brought by the changes would be minimal, as 75 percent of the beneficiaries take rides costing less than HK$10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that Mexico has proposed matching US tariffs on China in a move that he described as "very interesting" and one that Canada should match.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top Mexican officials have met with members of Trump's cabinet this week for trade talks ahead of a March 4 deadline, when US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports are set to get into effect alongside an additional 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington said unilateral tariff hikes by the US severely violate World Trade Organization rules and harm interests for China, the US and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressuring, coercion and threat is not the right way to deal with China. Instead, mutual respect is the basic prerequisite," embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement to Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to correct its wrongdoing and return to the right track of addressing each other’s concerns through equal-footed consultations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration has said for months that it is carefully considering Washington and Ottawa's policies towards China, saying even before Trump's re-election that it sought to be "more aligned" in addressing Chinese trade practices. (Reuters)

 China's space station will welcome its first foreign astronaut in the next few years, after China and Pakistan on Friday signed a cooperation agreement on the selection and training of astronauts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said China and Pakistan would spend roughly a year selecting the Pakistani astronauts, who would be trained in China before joining Chinese counterparts on the Tiangong space station for short-term missions "within the next few years".
  <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the agreement was signed by Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office, and Muhammad Yousuf Khan, chairman of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission at the Prime Minister's House.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a country with historically close ties to China, Pakistan has in recent years sought to improve its own space capabilities by participating in Chinese initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last May, Pakistan was one of several countries that placed payloads aboard the Chang'e-6 lunar probe, which ended up making China the first country to successfully retrieve samples from the moon's far side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Completed in late 2022, Tiangong can house a maximum of three astronauts for months at an orbital altitude of up to 450 km.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has a designed operational lifespan of at least 15 years. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Security on Friday voiced firm opposition to the US threat of imposing an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese exports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson made the remarks in response to a media inquiry on the United States' threatened tariff hike, which is scheduled to take effect from March 4 and cited fentanyl issues as the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said that once again, the United States was using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, despite China's stringent anti-drug policies and active international cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has provided support to Washington in addressing the fentanyl issue out of humanitarian concern, achieving notable results, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the root cause of America's fentanyl crisis lies within the US itself, adding that reducing domestic demand and strengthen law enforcement cooperation were the fundamental solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the US continued to ignore the core issue of drug demand, unfairly shifting the blame onto other countries, which undermined efforts to solve the problem and harmed China-US cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing urged the US to preserve the progress in bilateral anti-drug cooperation, and "return to the right path". (Xinhua)

    Microsoft to shut Skype in favour of Teams

<img alt='The president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms says the company "can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams." File Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793738_1_20250301070354.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Microsoft on Friday announced it was retiring Skype, the online voice and video call pioneer that the tech titan acquired in 2011.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Starting in May 2025, Skype will no longer be available," said a post from Skype support on X, directing users to sign into Microsoft's Teams platform for further use of its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skype was founded in 2003 by Scandinavians Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis in Estonia, revolutionizing internet communication by offering free voice calls between computers and affordable rates for calls to landlines and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the years, and as internet speeds improved, Skype evolved to include video calls, instant messaging, file sharing, and group communication features.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 2005, Skype had already reached 50 million registered users, demonstrating its rapid global adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online auction site eBay acquired Skype in 2005 for approximately US$2.6 billion, but the expected synergies never panned out, and in 2009, eBay sold a majority stake to a group of investors, who then sold it to Microsoft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, especially after the rise of the smartphone, Skype failed to hold onto its place against new rivals such as Meta-owned WhatsApp and Zoom, as well as Microsoft's own Teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned a lot from Skype... as we've evolved Teams over the last seven to eight years," Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we felt like now is the time because we can be simpler for the market, for our customer base, and we can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft said that Skype group chats would remain intact in the transition to Teams and that during a 60-day window, messages on Microsoft and Teams will be interoperable so you can message contacts from Teams, and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype. (AFP)

    Trump berates Zelensky in shock Oval office meeting

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is "not ready" for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraine's mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more "thankful" and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been taken by Russia. "You're either going to make a deal or we're out," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying "he is not ready for Peace," Trump wrote. "He can come back when he is ready for Peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting - in front of a large group of journalists - had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had said, "I think President Trump is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is "fairly close." The US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be "very fair."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Friday said Trump showed "restraint" by not hitting Ukrainian Zelensky during their shouting match in the White House. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the Hong Kong Jockey Club is hopeful that legislation clearing the way for basketball betting will be passed by lawmakers by September this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government revealed in its latest budget that it is looking into regulating basketball betting, and will invite the Jockey Club to submit a proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that the club has already submitted a proposal framework and met with government officials on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club has suggested that legalising basketball betting could take reference to football betting, which means it will charge a 50 percent duty from net betting revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected that after legalising basketball betting, the club could draw 30 to 40 percent of the city's illegal betting turnover to the tune of HK$30 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that HK$1 billion to HK$2 billion has to be invested in infrastructure, such as the development of a new computer system that would be rolled out in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also expected that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated for the government after four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the club will step up public education on basketball betting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club will contribute HK$50 million a year to the Ping Wo Fund that aims to help those with a gambling addiction.

    'Not enough separation for planes after take-off'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An unspecified number of air traffic control staff have been suspended over an incident involving two cargo planes that triggered an alert after take-off.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Civil Aviation Department (CAD), the two aircraft were cleared to take off from Hong Kong International Airport on Thursday morning, heading to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cargo planes was told by air traffic control to climb to 5,000 feet, and the other to 3,000 feet, to maintain separation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as the climbing rates of the two cargo flights varied from what the (air traffic control) officers had anticipated, the desired vertical separation was not achieved," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this time, both cargo flights followed standard departure procedures and maintained visual contact with each other."
  <br>
  <br>
  The second plane then descended to 2,500 feet after its traffic collision avoidance system issued an alert to its crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both aircraft continued to their destinations according to their flight plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CAD said preliminary information showed the incident might be due to air traffic control staff failing to abide by take-off protocols, and those involved have been temporarily removed from frontline duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said the department has been ordered to submit a report on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The report has to include, for example, procedures and staff related to the incident. I hope it can help prevent similar incidents in the future and allow us to do better," she said.

  In the latest financial budget, the government revealed that it is hoping to increase revenue by HK$2 billion annually by doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Mable Chan said the bureau will focus on traffic charges that have not gone up for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take parking meters as an example, [the charge] has not been adjusted for more than 30 years. And for fixed penalties for traffic-related offences such as parking [illegally], those too have not been adjusted for almost 30 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, our intention, apart from adhering to the principle of exercising fiscal prudence, is also to pay attention to traffic management, as well as road safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said officials hope "an appropriate adjustment" can serve as a deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that drivers have to pay tolls at eight out of 18 government tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She assured the public that the government will also consider people's affordability when carrying out the review.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king and two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung has encouraged students to never give up in the face of adversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was attending a student-sharing session after receiving an outstanding athlete award worth HK$3.375 million from his alma mater, Lam Tai Fai College.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, who captured gold in the individual foil event in Tokyo in 2021 and in Paris last year, told students that it's not all glamorous for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had a disappointing performance during the 2024 Asian Fencing Championships, held about two months before the Paris Olympics, and it took him some time to regain his confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world no. 2 encouraged students to never forget their goals or be discouraged when they encounter any difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Table tennis star Wong Chun-ting, who partnered with Doo Hoi-kem to reach the mixed doubles semi-finals at the Paris Games, was a fellow alumnus and received a prize of HK$375,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school's supervisor, Lam Tai-fai, said the athlete award programme demonstrates the school's contributions to Hong Kong sports and education.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Asian Games gold medallist, Stone Shek, on Friday announced his retirement from gymnastics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shek, 33, said on social media that it's been a difficult yet rewarding journey, saying gymnastics has been his life and he would give his career a full score of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to grow every day, from all the injuries to different low points in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I could choose again, I would choose gymnastics every time," Shek wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Staying committed to something difficult is hard, but it's the mindset that defines success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having taken up gymnastics as a boy, Shek said he has gone through everything after 26 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked his family, coaches, friends and supporters for "remembering him as the prince of gymnastics".
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek won gold at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon on the vault, and successfully defended the title in Jakarta four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also captured two World Cup gold medals in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek represented Hong Kong, China at three Olympics: London in 2012, Tokyo in 2021 and Paris last year.

    Smaller housing plots in next land sale programme

<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the plots in the coming financial year's land sale programme can house less than a thousand flats each. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793689_1_20250228180230.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Friday that eight residential plots it plans to roll out in the coming financial year can house around 4,450 flats, more than a fifth less than the figure from the current fiscal year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said none of the plots in the coming land sale programme are able to accommodate more than a thousand units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the sites are in urban areas, in Tsuen Wan, Shau Kei Wan, Jordan Valley, Ngau Tau Kok and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The others are in Tung Chung, Stanley and Tuen Mun, whose Hoi Chu Road plot for around 500 homes will be introduced in the next quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials want to roll out sites in urban areas because there are signs the property market is recovering and these plots should be quite attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some of them used to be school campuses, wet markets or planned community sites and officials decided to rezone them for housing because they were no longer needed for their original purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the government sites that have been developed in the past are not put to gainful use. Perhaps they have a lower development density, and after review we think that those sites can be put to better use," she told a press conference about the latest budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So given that this is an ongoing task, I would not rule out the possibility of more of such sites being rezoned for residential or commercial uses in future years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials will study the market situation before deciding which of the rest of the plots to put up and when.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the government decided not to keep three plots from this year in the next land sale programme, because of market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that one piece of land is in Kai Tak and said that has been removed because of abundant housing supply in the area. The other two plots to go are in Tuen Mun and Cheung Sha on Lantau.

    Govt seeking clarifications over latest US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said authorities are seeking clarifications as to whether new additional tariffs on Chinese imports announced by the US also cover goods from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump announced on his social media overnight that he will slap extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from March 4, on top of additional 10 percent levies imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, the commerce chief said the US tariffs are "unreasonable", reiterating that SAR authorities are filing an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the earlier tariffs move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand better the details of this [latest] imposition, whether the Hong Kong production and products are included or excluded, so we are making assessments for the time being and seeking clarification," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually the volumes of Hong Kong products trading with the US are very minimal, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total exports of Hong Kong, so the impact is not very significant at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials earlier confirmed that the first set of additional tariffs applies to Hong Kong, to which the SAR government responded by saying the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yau noted that Hong Kong is in discussions with Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on setting up economic and trade offices in the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong is exploring investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru, while actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, the commerce chief said Hong Kong remains a major investment hub as 10,000 overseas companies had settled in the SAR by the end of last year, a 10 percent rise on the number at the end of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said while about one fifth of those firms come from the mainland, 1,400 are from Japan and another 1,400 are from the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also about 720 firms from the UK and 520 from Singapore, which indicates that the city is attractive to foreign investors from various regions, he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said China's economic fundamentals remain solid despite the difficulties and challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi wrote about "properly handling several key relationships in economic work" in an article to be published on Saturday in Qiushi Journal, the flagship magazine of the Communist Party Central Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the unfavourable impact of changes in the external environment has deepened, and China's economy still faces numerous difficulties and challenges," the president wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, it must be recognised that China's economic fundamentals remain solid, with numerous advantages, strong resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The conditions supporting long-term growth and the overall positive trajectory have not changed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Friday, Xi chaired a Politburo meeting discussing a draft government work report to be submitted by the State Council to the upcoming national legislative session for review.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was noted at the meeting that China's economy maintained overall stability and made steady progress in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is also essential to accelerate the forging of a new pattern of development, solidly promote high-quality development, further deepen reform comprehensively, expand high-standard opening up, build a modern industrial system and better coordinate development and security," Xinhua reported.

    Ethnic minority advocacy group Unison to wind up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Unison, a group advocating the rights of the city's ethnic minorities, on Friday announced it was starting its dissolution process, saying its “historical mission has been successfully accomplished.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an executive committee meeting, committee chair Alice Chong said winding up the group was not an abrupt decision and it had started discussions around two or three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said 16 out of 17 members with voting rights supported the disband motion, adding it had nothing to do with political or financial matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are already more than 30 NGOs and groups that are now providing services and support in education, welfare, job and health to ethnic minority people. We are sure that they will be in good hands. We are also happy to [see] the government [has made] ethnic minority people as one of their priorities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said the decision was backed by most former board members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted the group had about HK$4 million in assets and after covering staff severance and long-term service pay, the rest of the money would be donated to other charity groups with similar goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation’s former executive director, John Tse, said he had not been consulted and called the move to disband “irresponsible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “How can we say that we’ve accomplished what we set out for? No one would say that, because look at the Hong Kong society, racism, discrimination against ethnic minorities, they’re so common,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse also noted the process of planning for winding up started back in September, but he was only instructed to stop receiving donations in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he and two other former staff members were planning to start a new group to continue their work helping ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former project officer Javria Khalid said she was let go a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so hurt, I feel like that we have let our ethnic community down,” she said. “I'm so speechless right now. I don't even know how to tell the parents, the students, the awardees, everyone that Unison is shut down.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said about 100 people, as well as over 10 ongoing projects, which include Chinese classes and mental health counselling sessions, would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Unison was founded in 2001 and was registered as a charitable organisation four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advocated for various policy changes to improve ethnic minority rights in Hong Kong, including the promotion of teaching of Chinese as a second language as well as getting the Race Discrimination Ordinance to come into effect in 2009.

 Cultural, Sports and Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law on Friday said the opening of the Kai Tak Sports Park is only the beginning of many mega events in March, adding that preparations are in the final stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Law said there will be a simple but grand ceremony on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The preparation for the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park is of course, at its final stage and a very intensive stage. Of course, rehearsals are ongoing, and then we are making final preparations for all the logistic arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about reports that Singapore will host concerts this year by American singer Lady Gaga, Law said Hong Kong will host Asian superstars and singers who haven't performed here for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing all we can with the Kai Tak Sports Park, the Tourism Board and other relevant bodies to try to attract and invite as many as possible international mega events to Hong Kong. It may or may not necessarily be just popular concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the government will earmark HK$1.2 billion for the Tourism Board, lower than the HK$1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to this, Law said the Tourism Board has enough reserves and she hopes the board will use its resources prudently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each year, HKTB will be monitoring very closely and announcing the tourist spending and the tourist duration of stay, both for overnight visitors and for same-day visitors. These will obviously be some of the KPIs that we will be looking for," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Friday said it opposed US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and vowed to take "all necessary countermeasures" if Chinese entities got caught up in the levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry accused the US of "shifting the blame" on fentanyl flows into the United States and urged Washington to "return to the right track of properly resolving differences through dialogue on an equal footing as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added China had some of the world's strictest anti-drug policies and highlighted the risks new tariffs would bring to global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday his proposed 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods would take effect on Tuesday, along with the additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed on China earlier this month. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says people attending the opening ceremony for Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday evening must get their tickets by 3pm on the day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 8,000 people received vouchers which have to be exchanged in person for the tickets they bought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Choi said on Friday morning that so far, nearly half of the buyers have collected their tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the ceremony will begin at 6.30pm, the 3pm cut-off time for ticket exchanges is necessary for the sake of crowd control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our gates will open at 4.30pm for the opening ceremony," Choi said at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are many people queuing for ticket exchange at the last minute, we don't want so many people colliding, going in different directions at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  In total, more than 30,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony in the Kai Tak Stadium, with officials urging them to travel to the venue by public transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said no parking will be available at the Kai Tak Mall inside the sports park on Saturday, a restriction that will also be in place for future large-scale events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a special pick-up and drop-off zone on Sung Wong Toi Road for those arriving by private car or taxi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials noted that no professional cameras, long umbrellas or water bottles will be allowed in the stadium, also reminding people that ticket scalping is not permitted.

    Home prices drop to almost 8.5-year low

<img alt="Home prices retreated for the second month in a row in January. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793618_1_20250228110317.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices retreated to their lowest level in nearly eight and a half years in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department on Friday showed that the city's home price index dropped to 287.6, from 288.9 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marked a 0.4 percent decline on a monthly basis and a 6.5 percent retreat from a year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices had risen in October and November after cheaper borrowing costs attracted buyers to take the plunge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at consultancy CBRE Hong Kong, said January was low season for the property market due to the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also partially attributed the declines to developers rolling out new residential projects while also pushing existing inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said he expects a rebound later this year, noting that home prices are highly correlated with the city's stock market performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the Hang Seng Index remains at its current level or continue to increase, we expect residential prices for the secondary market to stabilise and potentially pick up going forward," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rental prices continued to edge up in January, with the official key gauge rising to its highest level in four months to stand at 192.9.

    HK must adapt to Trump tariffs, FS tells phone-in show

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said overseas firms were still keen on the mainland market and on Hong Kong's position as a gateway to that, a day after US President Donald Trump said a further 10 percent levies on China would be going ahead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan was commenting on Friday during an RTHK radio phone-in programme on his 2025-26 budget that he unveiled on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We try to reinforce the relationships and trading relationships with developed economies, US, Europe, because for them, in our contact with them, many of their businesses are still very interested in the mainland market, and Hong Kong will be the natural landing platform for them, using this platform to access the mainland market and to expand in the region," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the importance of Hong Kong re-aligning itself as a high value-added supply chain management centre, as well as opening up new capital markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan's budget on Wednesday announced cuts to thousands of civil service jobs and a boost in spending in artificial intelligence as it seeks to tackle a deficit of HK$87 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  One caller, Ng, noted that a number of projects that were issued grants under the Innovation and Technology Fund were related to medical and healthcare, yet the government focused on AI and new industrialisation in his speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  He asked: "Is it because the government has evaluated these [healthcare] projects? They have granted the subsidies and they are useless?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would continue to invest heavily in medical and healthcare, and continue to give grants to universities but would shift the focus to the private sector and industry-led research.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Lok Ma Chau Loop between the border of Hong Kong and Shenzhen will be a major area for these companies to be located. And also we think perhaps it would be wiser not just using government's money, but also using market resources. That is why we put up a scheme on a matching basis to co-invest with general partners, which are fund managers in these areas," said Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also stressed how technology could take away some of the burden of civil servants to ensure public services are not affected, as the administration gradually reduces its headcount.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set aside resources and provided training to help our various [departments] to use technology tools to enhance their work efficiency and also take the opportunity to streamline, to review their operational model and procedures, to see how this could be further rationalised and optimised."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller, Steven, expressed disappointment that the non-means-tested one-off student grant of HK$2,500 would not be continued, and asked whether the government cared about the city's birthrate and providing support to parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the budget allocation for education continued to exceed HK$100 billion a year, which he described as "a very substantial investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Education Bureau considered that student grant, being non-means-tested, was not targeted to help those in need.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina's state disability agency apologised on Thursday following a furore over the use of the terms "idiot", "imbecile" and "mentally retarded" to describe people with disabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The uproar was caused by a text published as part of libertarian President Javier Milei's clampdown on disability fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government, which is reviewing disability payments received by around a million Argentines, last month issued a decree setting out the parameters of mental and physical disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  An annex to the decree classified people with mental disabilities according to their IQ as follows: "0-30 (idiot)," "30-50 (imbecile)," "50-60 (severely mentally retarded," "60-70 (moderately mentally retarded)," and "70-90 (slightly mentally retarded)".
  <br>
  <br>
  Each category also included a description of which functions the person can perform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disability support groups and human rights groups protested the terminology and demanded that the National Disabilities Agency scrap the classification.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups accused the agency of using "very violent terminology" which "reinforces stereotypes and historical discrimination".
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the agency admitted an "error" in using "obsolete terminology" and that it would modify the text to use universally accepted terms to describe levels of disability. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned members of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, accusing them of making baseless allegations against Hong Kong's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government dismissed what it described as a so-called resolution criticising Hong Kong's autonomy and its national security law, labelling it "political manoeuvring and reckless clamoring".
  <br>
  <br>
  It called on the US to stop undermining Hong Kong's international reputation and interfering in Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said US politicians had time and again made skewed remarks about Hong Kong's situation and advocated imposing "sanctions" on the SAR to undermine its rule of law and its prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National security is the foundation for prosperity and stability in society, as well as the well-being of the people," the spokesperson said, highlighting the success of the law in restoring order after the 2019 unrest and fostering Hong Kong's economic recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also criticised the US for its double standards, noting that it has at least 21 pieces of laws safeguarding national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson added that the national security law complies with international human rights standards, reaffirming that Hong Kong's legal system ensures freedom and protection under the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ongoing legal cases, the spokesperson emphasised that all proceedings are based on evidence and the rule of law.

    'Private sector growth high on Two Sessions agenda'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Support for private businesses is a very important area that will be addressed during the upcoming "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, according to Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first of our series previewing this year's National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meetings, NPC Standing Committee member Starry Lee said there is an urgency to attract more private investment to China amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protections and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments at or above the county level to provide regular reports on their progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's "set to become China's first fundamental law dedicated to the private sector," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee attended an NPC Standing Committee meeting in the capital this week examining the bill's second draft, ahead of the opening of the NPC session next Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe some of the initiatives will be mentioned in the government report... to further invite and encourage private investment," she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has a role to play in trying to shore up support for the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the current geopolitical situation, there is always an urgency to have more private investment to invest in our country, not only from Hong Kong, but from different parts of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being one of the most international cities in our country, we have our responsibility to attract more talent, enterprises and technology to come to Hong Kong to help to build further our financial market and also the technology side."

  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and Lee said people have high expectations for the next blueprint for 2026-2030 which she believes would be related to the resolution adopted in the third party plenary session last year.

  The NPC Standing Committee member added that the SAR, the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, as well as the Northern Metropolis will be "key stakeholders" to contribute to the country's development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovich said Thursday he won't return this season as coach of the San Antonio Spurs as he continues to recover from a stroke he suffered in November.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I've decided not to return to the sidelines this season," the 76-year-old coach said in a statement posted on the Spurs X account. "Mitch Johnson and his staff have done a wonderful job and the resolve and professionalism the players have shown, sticking together during a challenging season, has been outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to focus on my health with the hope that I can return to coaching in the future," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that the statement came after Popovich met with Spurs players – their first chance to see him since he suffered what the team has described as a "mild stroke" on November 2 at the team's arena before a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Mitch Johnson was named interim coach, with Popovich saying in December he was working toward a return to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich, the oldest coach in NBA history, has 1,412 regular-season wins and another 170 post-season triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has guided the Spurs to five NBA titles in his 29 seasons at the helm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also the USA to basketball gold at the Tokyo Olympics and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of fame in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich's stroke is just one of the setbacks for the young Spurs team this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team announced this month that second-year star Victor Wembanyama would miss the rest of the regular-season after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right shoulder. (AFP)

    West Ham ease to victory over lacklustre Leicester

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leicester sank closer to an immediate return to the Championship after West Ham pulled clear of the bottom three with a convincing 2-0 win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek and a Jannik Vestergaard own goal did for the Foxes before half-time as the Hammers climbed to 15th and 16 points clear of the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Leicester won the reverse fixture in Ruud van Nistelrooy's first game in charge in early December, the Dutchman has overseen 11 defeats and one draw in 13 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goals we concede are easy goals. It's a reflection of how we played in the first half," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were way too passive," he added. "We are in a situation where we are not winning games and we are in a situation where we are in the bottom three. The pressure is on – we cannot wait and sit back."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were buoyant after their shock 1-0 victory at Arsenal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Graham Potter's men were well worthy of another three points and could have ran out much more comfortable winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a professional performance. Not fantastic, but we are delighted with two wins, two clean sheets and six points," said Potter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soucek had the simple task to tap into an empty net after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen saved Mohammed Kudus' effort from close range on 21 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen then took advantage of slack Leicester defending from a corner just before half-time and his shot deflected off the unfortunate Vestergaard beyond Hermansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Ferguson wasted the chance to score his first West Ham goal when his shot was blocked by Wout Faes after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the home side had already done enough to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves Leicester still five points adrift of safety in 19th and showing no signs of being able to stop a slide back into the second tier. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday, extending a rough period as disappointment with Nvidia earnings and fresh tariff rhetoric from US President Donald Trump pressured the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Nvidia reported impressive profits, shares finished down 8.5 percent, with investors seemingly wanting more from the artificial intelligence company.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have gotten used to having Nvidia blow the door off," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "They did well but they didn't blow the door off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin also cited remarks from Trump indicating that 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.5 percent at 43,239.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent to 5,861, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.8 percent to 18,544.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shooting to records earlier this month, US indices have struggled in recent sessions following a trove of lackluster economic data as Trump presses on with assertive trade policy and government job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, weekly jobless claims exceeded estimates, while pending home sales also disappointed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other AI companies fell, including Arm Holdings, which lost 6.2 percent and Broadcom, which dropped 7.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Salesforce fell 4.0 percent on disappointment with the software company's forecast
  <br>
  <br>
  EBay slumped 8.2 percent as the company's cautious financial outlook added to concerns about its exposure to tariff actions. (AFP)

    Russian chess grandmaster Spassky dies aged 88

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soviet chess grandmaster Boris Spassky, who was famously defeated in the so-called match of the century at the height of the Cold War, has died aged 88, the Chess Federation of Russia said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federation called his death a "great loss to the country", saying generations of chess players had learned from his matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the first to react was Soviet grandmaster Anatoly Karpov, who told TASS state news agency: "He was always one of my main idols."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spassky is best remembered for his duel with American Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between East and West.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Soviet chess giant lived a checkered life, flitting between top-level clashes against the best players of the era and periods of virtual disappearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to play chess at the age of five in an orphanage, having managed to flee Leningrad with his family when it was besieged by the Nazis during World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the war, his aggressive style of play without fear of sacrifice was noticed by his peers and encouraged by the state, which provided him with a scholarship and a coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having made a strong impression, he found himself in the shadow of another rising figure in Soviet chess, Mikhail Tal, the so-called "Magician of Riga".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not until 1961 that Spassky made a remarkable comeback by winning the USSR Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight years later he defeated his compatriot Tigran Petrosian to take the world title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never set myself the goal of becoming world champion. Everything worked out by itself. I was progressing in leaps and bounds," Spassky said in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Spassky would keep his title for just three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1972 in Iceland he played the match that would define his career, against the American prodigy Fischer.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Cold War at its height and the Soviet Union having dominated the game for years, Spassky faced a must-win situation in his match-up with the eccentric 29-year-old, who openly criticised Soviet chess players.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a comfortable start for Spassky, the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, for Spassky it was a relief to be rid of a "colossal responsibility".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title away from me. I freed myself from a very heavy burden and breathed freely," he said nearly four decades later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The iconic Cold War duel has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired the Walter Tevis novel "The Queen's Gambit," which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at the time, in the wake of his defeat, Spassky fell out of favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four years later, in 1976, he moved to France, after marrying a Frenchwoman of Russian origin. He obtained French citizenship in 1978. Spassky did not return to the public sphere for years, until he played an unofficial rematch against Fischer in Yugoslavia in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last years of his life were marked by ill health and a mysterious family conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two strokes, he returned to Russia in 2012 with the help of a sponsor and against the advice of his wife and sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to start over from scratch, but I'm not afraid," Spassky said on Russian television after his return.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few years earlier, in 2008, he had visited the grave of his former rival Fischer, who died that year and was buried in a small cemetery in Iceland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do you think that the neighbouring spot is available?" Spassky asked journalists accompanying him on the visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spassky lived in Moscow and his relatives informed the chess federation of his death, its executive director Alexander Tkachev told RIA Novosti news agency. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at the White House on Thursday for their first in-person talks since the Republican leader upended US policy on Ukraine, the Middle East, and global trade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starmer is the second European leader to meet Trump this week after French President Emmanuel Macron came to the White House on Monday for a friendly encounter that nonetheless displayed stark differences about Russia's war with Ukraine and the US push for a quick ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British leader arrived at the White House on Thursday afternoon, where he was greeted by the president at the West Wing entrance ahead of meetings and a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the US could get a peace deal on Ukraine, Trump said that a peace deal needs to be struck soon between Ukraine and Russia or it may not happen "at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we've made a lot of progress and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly," Trump said. "It'll either be fairly soon or it won't be at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he trusted Russia's Vladimir Putin to stick to any Ukraine ceasefire, as Starmer tried to win security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  He walked back a remark about Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky being a dictator that alarmed European capitals, saying, "Did I say that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters as he sat alongside Starmer in the Oval Office when asked about Putin, "I think he'll keep his word."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Britain can "take care of themselves, but if they need help, I'll always be with the British."
  <br>
  <br>
  The British premier told Trump at the White House that he wanted to "work with you to make sure that the peace deal is enduring" but that it was also a "deal that nobody breaches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also expressed hope for a trade deal to be struck between both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to have a great trade agreement, one way or the other," Trump told reporters. "We're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries, and we're working on that as we speak."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will host Zelensky at the White House on Friday, where the two leaders are expected to sign a deal giving Washington access to Ukraine's rare minerals, which Trump has demanded as payback for US military aid. (Agencies)

<img alt="Donald Trump says he will double the 10 percent tariff charged on imports from China from March 4. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793557_1_20250227225651.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would impose an added 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports while moving ahead with levies on Canada and Mexico next week, citing "unacceptable" fentanyl smuggling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced – then halted – sweeping 25 percent levies on Canadian and Mexican imports this month over illegal immigration and deadly fentanyl, with Canadian energy to face a lower rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the month-long pause ends next Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following reporters' questions on whether he planned to proceed on the tariffs next week, Trump wrote on social media on Thursday that until the problem of fentanyl stops "or is seriously limited," proposed levies will happen as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will likewise be charged an additional 10 percent Tariff on that date," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not give further details on how the move interacts with an earlier levy he imposed on Chinese imports over Beijing's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, or how negotiations with China were proceeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has voiced firm opposition to the US decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it is one of the countries with the strictest drug control policies and the most rigorous enforcement in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added on Truth Social that an April 2 date for so-called reciprocal tariffs "will remain in full force and effect." (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States has slashed its multi-year aid contracts by 92 percent, as it sought around US$60 billion in savings in development and overseas humanitarian programmes, the State Department said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office, demanding a 90-day freeze on all US foreign aid to give his administration time to review overseas spending, with an eye to gutting programmes not aligned with his "America First" agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  A federal judge had given the Trump administration on Tuesday less than two days to unfreeze all aid after a previous court order issued nearly two weeks earlier went ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Trump administration filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court, which issued an administrative stay late on Wednesday, pausing the lower court's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the conclusion of a process led by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary (Marco) Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with US$54 billion in value remaining were identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda – a 92 percent reduction," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration's review in part targeted multi-year foreign assistance contracts awarded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), with the vast majority eliminated during its course.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also looked at more than 9,100 grants involving foreign assistance, valued at more than US$15.9 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the review, 4,100 grants worth almost US$4.4 billion were targeted to be eliminated, a 28 percent reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These commonsense eliminations will allow the bureaus, along with their contracting and grants officers, to focus on remaining programmes, find additional efficiencies and tailor subsequent programmes more closely to the Administration's America First priorities," the State Department statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  USAID distributes US humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programmes in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Programmes that were not cut included food assistance, life-saving medical treatments for diseases like HIV and malaria, and support for countries including Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela and Lebanon, among others, the State Department spokesperson said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Thursday pushed back against allegations by US President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would fight any wholesale tariff of 25 percent on all EU products.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pushback came after Trump told reporters at his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday that “the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it, and they’ve done a good job of it,” adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counter-offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The EU wasn’t formed to screw anyone," Tusk said in an X post. "Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also threatened to introduce tariffs on EU imports, saying his administration will soon announce a 25 percent "reciprocal" tariff on goods from its longtime trade partner, including cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  French Finance Minister Eric Lombard said on Thursday that the EU would "do the same" if the US follows through with the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that if the Americans maintain the tariff hikes, as President Trump announced, the EU will do the same," Lombard told AFP on the sidelines of the G20 finance ministers meeting in Cape Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if it is not in the general interest, we too must protect our interests and the interests of the countries of the union.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy’s business lobby said late on Wednesday that Trump’s tariff threat would undermine EU's companies, and its workforce and require a strong response from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is not only of an impact on trade dynamics. The truth is far more dramatic... What is coming from the American leadership is an attack on European companies and jobs," Confindustria president Emanuele Orsini said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Trump's trade policies aimed to "de-industrialise" the European continent and urged Brussels to consider "extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a dark hour," Orsini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry Minister Adolfo Urso, a member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, took a more conciliatory tone, saying a trade war had to be avoided and urging unity among the Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Italy Governor Fabio Panetta said this month that a full implementation of the tariffs, plus retaliatory measures, would cut EU growth by half a percentage point, with Germany and Italy hardest hit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tit-for-tat dispute further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies. (Agencies)

    Legendary Irish trio to retire at end of Six Nations

<img alt="Last year's Six Nations title-winning skipper Peter O'Mahony is as famous for his gardening skills as his rugby prowess. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793545_1_20250227214946.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three "legends" of Irish rugby, record caps holder Cian Healy, last year's Six Nations title-winning skipper Peter O'Mahony and fellow Test centurion Conor Murray will retire from international rugby at the end of the Six Nations, they announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are on course for what could be a fairytale ending to their Test career with an unprecedented third successive Six Nations title.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish have recorded three victories from three Tests in this year's tournament – though they host biggest rivals France on Saturday week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They round off their campaign against Italy in Rome on March 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whilst back-row forward O'Mahony remains a starter both prop Healy and scrum-half Murray have added invaluable support off the bench for several years as Andrew Porter and Jamison Gibson-Park respectively replaced them in the first-choice XV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio have been pivotal figures in the success the Irish have enjoyed under Joe Schmidt and then his successor Andy Farrell – winning the Six Nations title five times including the Grand Slam twice since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It goes without saying that Peter, Cian and Conor are legends of not just Irish rugby, but Irish sport, and have each made a significant contribution to the success of Irish rugby for more than 15 years," said Performance Director David Humphreys in an Irish Rugby Football Union statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is still so much to play for with Ireland and their provinces and we will mark their careers at an appropriate time in the near future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interim Ireland coach Simon Easterby, who is standing in for Farrell as he focuses on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia, knows the trio well as he has been part of the Ireland coaching set-up for the golden era too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby, who has also shared in the major disappointment for all of them – the failure to get past the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals (2015/19/23) – said it had been a "privilege" to work with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have each played a huge role in the success of Irish rugby over the course of their careers and they continue to inspire their teammates around them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Watching how openly they engage with players in their own position and continue to add value around the set-up is testament to their collective character and they are also adding real value on the pitch."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both 37-year-old Healy, who has 136 caps and broke Brian O'Driscoll's previous record last November, and 112-times capped O'Mahony, 35, will retire from all rugby at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time British & Irish Lion tourist Murray, who forged the at-one-time most feared halfback partnership with Johnny Sexton, will be 36 come season-end but is due to play for a club outside Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Healy and O'Mahony retirement should not be a problem as the former has established himself as a renowned knife-maker and the latter is almost as well known for his gardening skills. (AFP)

    'SAR debt still at very manageable level'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the ratio of government debt to GDP is less than 17 percent. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793524_1_20250227181644.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR's debt is still "at a very manageable level", and that the government has maintained close contact with global credit rating agencies relating to its financial position.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui's remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that the government plans to issue about HK$150 billion to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the next five years to support infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have long been in close contact with some relevant rating agencies and we have very regular communications, so that we'll ensure they know about the specific [financial] situation of Hong Kong, our bond issuance plans, as well as the reasoning on how we manage our finances," Hui said in a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're actually maintaining our debts at a very manageable level right now. As you can see, compared with some other economies, the share of our bond issuance to our overall gross domestic product is less than 17 percent. This is actually very manageable level compared with the international level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the financial services and treasury chief noted that authorities hope to improve the city's financial markets by conducting reforms of the stock trading and company listing mechanisms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures include the gradual introduction of a new function by the end of the year to enable most stock transactions to settle one business day after the trade date, in what's called the "T+1" settlement cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new settlement cycle will help improve the quality of the city's stock trading, as the current "T+2" settlement cycle is lagging behind other international peers, such as the US, Canada, and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a global trend, really, in terms of increasing capital deployment efficiency, and allow capital to be returned to the investors sooner, so that they can utilise it further," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other reform measures include the establishment of a "technology enterprises channel" by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to help specialist technology and biotechnology companies, especially those listed on the mainland, seek listings in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new channel will provide "tailor-made" assistance and guidance for those firms to prepare better before they submit their IPO applications.

    'Govt needs time to get ready for HK$2 subsidy tweaks'

<img alt="Chris Sun says only 360 people were found to have taken more than 240 trips a month under the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793531_1_20250227185519.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun on Thursday said it will take time for the authorities to prepare for changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, which will be implemented no later than September next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  As outlined in the budget delivered by Financial Secretary Paul Chan the day before, instead of a flat HK$2 fare, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare surpassing HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, Sun said the government wants to ensure all 17,000 Octopus readers in the city are properly set up for the "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 per cent discount" scheme, which will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the machines are spread out on the MTR, buses, minibuses and resident coaches, and adjustments can only be made one-by-one at the end of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welfare minister also said changes to the subsidy scheme were made after careful discussions among officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe we have struck a right balance between, first of all, to preserve as far as possible the very reasons of introducing a HK$2 concession fare scheme, which is to encourage our elderly and the disabled to go out and to see for themselves the beauty of the outside world and also to remain socially connected, and secondly, to make sure the concession fare scheme will be fiscally sustainable into the future,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the proposed monthly cap of 240 trips, Sun said only 360 people were found to have exceeded that number each month between August and November, amounting to less than 1 percent of all such users, so most other elderly and disabled travellers won't be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sun said his bureau has invited the 177 non-profit organisations (NGOs) that receive government funding for a meeting next Monday to discuss a proposed 7 percent cut in recurrent government spending through the 2027-28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll let them know [how] exactly we’re going to work together to achieve the efficiency gains and yet at the same time providing more flexibility to our NGOs,” he said. "Right now I'm not in a position to provide you with a detailed breakdown."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forty Chinese nationals involved in illegal immigration were repatriated from Thailand on Thursday in a coordinated effort to combat cross-border crime and safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens, according to Ministry of Public Security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The operation, conducted in accordance with Chinese and Thai laws, international regulations and established practices, is one example of ongoing collaboration between the two nations to address transnational criminal activities, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior ministry official said the repatriated individuals had been deceived by criminal organisations into illegally crossing borders, ultimately becoming stranded in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their families have repeatedly sought government assistance for their return," the official said, stressing that the repatriation reflects China's commitment to protecting its citizens' legitimate rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official further emphasised that the repatriated individuals' legal rights were fully protected throughout the process, and that they will receive assistance in re-integrating into their families and society once the necessary legal procedures are completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Recent joint operations between China and Thailand have yielded fruitful outcomes in combating transnational crimes, including telecommunications and internet fraud," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday, the National Immigration Administration said in a statement that the Chinese government firmly opposes illegal immigration in any form. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six others were on Thursday sentenced to between 25 and 37 months behind bars each, after earlier being found guilty of rioting in Yuen Long in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court handed down the longest term to Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the 37-month sentence, judge Stanley Chan said Lam showed no remorse and had played a different role than the other defendants in the riot on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said Lam was well-known and his visit to Yuen Long on the day in question had a “different impact” and had worsened confrontations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan rejected the defence's claim that the defendant had intended to resolve conflicts between two rival groups of people, saying he had “fanned the flames” and failed to ask people to stay calm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam will serve three months of his jail term concurrently with the six years and nine months he received earlier for conspiring to commit subversion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi on Thursday said there is "never a good time" to scrap the HK$2,500 student grant but the current financial situation makes it necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Choi said the cancellation is expected to save around HK$2 billion annually, which is around two percent of the total education expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For when to remove the HK$2,500 [student grant] will be the right time, I think there's never a good time to do that, but we are still considering the present financial situation. We have to make a decision," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The education chief said measures are still in place to address the plight of underprivileged pupils and parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different student financial assistance schemes and different resources from the working family financial assistance scheme. We are also considering increasing the flexibility of using different allowances or grants in the schools."
  <br>
  <br>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung said in a statement that he was not consulted over discontinuing the subsidy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who was consulted on the measure, Choi said officials don't share specific details about the budget with individual lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that officials talked to different stakeholders about which measures they wanted to keep if spending cuts were needed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, his wife and their dog were found dead in their New Mexico home on Wednesday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foul play was not suspected, but authorities did not release circumstances of their deaths and said an investigation was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe County Sheriff’s deputies found Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and a dog dead when they preformed a welfare check at the home around 1.45pm, spokesperson Denise Avila said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, 95, was a five-time Oscar nominee who starred in dozens of films and one of the industry’s most respected and honoured performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His two Oscar wins, for “The French Connection” and “Unforgiven,” were spaced out 21 years apart.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of his death comes just four days before this year’s Academy Awards ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple’s home is in a gated community just outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico’s capital city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman moved in the 1980s to the area, where he was often seen around town and served as a board member of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in the 1990s, according to the local paper, The New Mexican.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman played a variety of roles, appearing in action movies, thrillers and even had a comedic part in “Young Frankenstein.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from appearances at awards shows, he was rarely seen in the Hollywood social circuit and retired in his mid-70s. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong on Thursday said a new Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute could commence operation as early as next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that the government will earmark HK$1 billion for the institute's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Sun said the institute will not only advance AI research, but also promote its application across various sectors, including innovation and technology, finance, healthcare and government services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the goal is for the institute to take a leadership role in these areas, and generate business opportunities for the local industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute will focus on facilitating upstream R&D, midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes and expanding application scenarios. So in terms of the goal and the scale, this AI R&D institute is different from the current InnoHK centre, HKGAI (Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The AI institute will be established based on the existing HKGAI centre. In the future, we will gradually integrate the InnoHK centre, HKGAI, into the newly established AI research institute."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, in response to suggestions from lawmakers that Hong Kong should attract the mainland AI company DeepSeek to the city, Sun said all domestic and international AI companies are welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the recently launched large language model HKGAI V1, the SAR's first locally developed generative artificial intelligence, already incorporates DeepSeek-related technology.

<img alt="Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) posted a record profit for 2024. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793473_1_20250227143726.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which operates the city's stock exchange, posted its best-ever annual profit, revenue, and income during 2024 - on the back of the rising market turnover and new listings especially during the fourth quarter of last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Upon releasing its annual financial results on Thursday, the bourse operator revealed its net profit for 2024 rose 10 percent year on year to HK$13 billion, from the HK$11.9 billion registered a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was better than market expectations while surpassing the previous record of HK$12.5 billion seen in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue and other income, meanwhile, rose nine percent year on year to HK$22.3 billion in 2024, while core business revenue also rose by nine percent to HK$20.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a second interim dividend of HK$4.90 per share, 25 percent more compared with last year, while bringing the annual total to HK$9.26 per share, a rise of 10 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also maintained the payout ratio at 90 percent of earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKEX achieved significant progress and delivery in 2024, a year that featured greater connectivity and engagement with international markets, the launch of multi-year infrastructure enhancement programmes, and fresh trading records that underscore the market’s vibrancy and resilience," said Bonnie Chan, director and chief executive of HKEX, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The improved macro backdrop supported renewed vibrancy and robustness of our markets, which was reflected in the largest IPO in Hong Kong since 2021 as well as an all-time record trading turnover," she noted.

    Govt won't rely on land sales for revenue: Paul Chan
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday that the government no longer wants to rely heavily on land sales as a main source of revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't "overly cold".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, previously known as Lantau Tomorrow Vision, is "dead", being as there is no mention of it in the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment.

    HKU and CUHK to get 60 more medical training places

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau said that medical schools at Chinese University (CUHK) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) would have 60 more training places in the next academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said 50 places would be reserved for CUHK and HKU to introduce a new entry track for bachelor’s degree holders who want to pursue medicine as their second degree.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from RTHK, CUHK said it would announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget address on Wednesday that the number of medical training places would increase to 650 in total in the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these takes time to prepare. That's why the increase has to be gradual."

    FS shoots down levy for all outbound travellers
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793462_2_20250227135507.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said a proposed levy on private cars departing Hong Kong is aimed at clawing back government spending on cross-boundary facilities, while dismissing the idea of a fee for all outbound travellers over the potential impact on the public.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be "avoided as much as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?" asked a man surnamed Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028," he said.

 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Michelle Trachtenberg, a former child star who appeared in the 1996 “Harriet the Spy” hit movie and went on to co-star in two buzzy millennial-era TV shows — “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Gossip Girl” — has died. She was 39.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police responded to a 911 call shortly after 8am at a 51-storey luxury apartment tower in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood where officers found Trachtenberg "unconscious and unresponsive,” according to an NYPD statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  No foul play was suspected and the New York Medical Examiner is investigating the cause of death, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The family requests privacy for their loss," Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trachtenberg was eight when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon’s “The Adventures of Pete & Pete” from 1994 to 1996 and then starred in the title role in the film adaptations of “Harriet the Spy” and “Inspector Gadget,” opposite Matthew Broderick.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Michelle comes off as genuine because she really is a genuine kid. Everyone can identify with her,” said Debby Beece, president of Nickelodeon Movies in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of “Buffy,” playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. (AP)

    '99pc of people won't exceed new HK$2 scheme limits'

 An Executive Councillor on Thursday said most of Hong Kong's senior citizens will not be affected by changes to the city's fare concessionary scheme for the over 60s.
 <br>
  <br>
  As announced in Wednesday's budget, instead of a flat fare of HK$2, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare exceeding HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme will also be capped at 240 trips per month, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Ching-choi, who formerly chaired the Elderly Commission, was speaking to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only a small percentage of them, they might travel quite a lot because actually, we set the limit quite liberally, I don't think it will affect most individuals who are just trying to visit their grandchildren, or going to work" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On average, I believe 99 percent of individuals won't exceed the limit," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said this fine-tuned proposal preserves the government's policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to beneficiaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sailing industry on Thursday said they welcomed Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s plan to build a new waterfront landmark in Hung Hom, with a yacht club mooted there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his budget speech the day before, Chan said the MTR Corporation has been asked to conduct a study to develop an area south of Hung Hom Station, as well as nearby pier sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is definitely good news to promote yachting and yachting tourism in Hong Kong," the Commodore of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club Adrian Pang told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said that currently, Hong Kong lacks berths and moorings for boats that want to visit the SAR, adding that authorities can do more to provide land for yachting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out the city’s geography means there is a lot of potential in developing the sailing industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at Hong Kong, we are unique in a sense that if you look at the Greater Bay Area, we have the most beautiful coastline, we have all the ecoparks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want the Hung Hom landmark to also include "iconic commercial and residential developments, retail, dining and entertainment facilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I welcome the government to do more studies and hopefully we can develop more sites," Pang added.

    Afghanistan knock England out of Champions Trophy

<img alt="Afghanistan's Azmatullah Omarzai, left, celebrates with teammate Ibrahim Zadran after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793419_1_20250227081610.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Ibrahim Zadran's 177 and five wickets by Azmatullah Omarzai helped Afghanistan knock England out of the Champions Trophy with a thrilling eight-run victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan posted 325-7 in a virtual knockout tie in Lahore and then bowled out England for 317 in 49.5 overs to stay alive in the race for a semi-final place while England have no chance of reaching the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joe Root's 120 went in vain as England lost regular wickets to lose their second straight ODI to the Afghans after their shock defeat in the 2023 World Cup in India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing 13 off the last six balls with one wicket in hand, pace bowler Omarzai kept calm to give away just four runs and dismiss Adil Rashid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Playing under the cloud of boycott calls from some British politicians over the plight of women in the Taliban-ruled nation, Afghanistan elected to bat in a bid to bounce back from their opening loss to South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they soon slipped to 37-3 inside nine overs before Zadran pulled the innings together with a fourth-wicket partnership of 103 with skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who made 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zadran, 23, later added 111 for the sixth wicket with Mohammad Nabi, who hit 40 in 24 balls. He took the England bowling apart and went past his previous ODI best of 162 in his 146-ball knock laced with 12 fours and six sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He not only broke his own record for Afghanistan's highest individual ODI score but also a tournament record, days after Ben Duckett's 165 in England's opening loss to Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it was one of the best ODI innings I have ever seen," said Shahidi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Wood's injury in the middle of his fourth over hampered England as the fast bowler managed just eight overs and went off with a knee issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, England lost two early wickets to be 30-2 after senior spinner Mohammad Nabi struck with his first ball to send back Jamie Smith for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duckett attempted to hit back in a 68-run stand with Root to steady the chase but Rashid Khan trapped the left-handed opener lbw for 38.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Brook looked fluent in his 25 but fell caught and bowled to Nabi in a soft dismissal to further put England in trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Root kept calm and along with skipper Jos Buttler, who took time to settle before hitting two sixes, put on 83 runs to keep the chase going.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan bowlers kept up the pressure with dot balls and Omarzai got the skipper out for 38 off a top edge caught at deep square-leg and Liam Livingstone departed soon after.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Root hung on as he reached his first ODI ton in almost five years and 37 innings and with Jamie Overton kept chipping away with regular boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Omarzai got the prized wicket as he had Root caught behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He played an unbelievable innings tonight. The way to handle pressure in a run-chase," said Buttler. "He needed one of the other top six batters to stay in with him and take the game deeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pendulum kept swinging as Omarzai dismissed Overton but despite Jofra Archer's late push England went down as the third team to be eliminated in the eight-nation tournament after hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh. (AFP)
