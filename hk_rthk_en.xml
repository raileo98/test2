<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level." (Reuters)

    Russia, Ukraine exchange massive drone attacks

<img alt="Residents survey the damage after multiple drone strikes in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778432_1_20241110201053.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring a woman and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, while a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine, officials reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  A top UK defence official meanwhile said that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since their full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief of the UK defence staff, Tony Radakin, said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded “every single day,” bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying “an extraordinary price" for the war, even as a gruelling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the losses were for “tiny increments of land,” and that Moscow's mounting defence and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for “as long as it takes” to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of US President-elect Donald Trump have signalled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following “human wave” attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a “record” 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were “lost”, the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Governor Oleh Kiper reported. (AP)

    Dozens dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Lebanon

<img alt="The first strike early on Sunday completely demolished a house in Jabalia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778426_1_20241110192106.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched deadly strikes on Gaza and Lebanon on Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers in Gaza on Sunday said 30 people, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first strike early on Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing "at least 25" people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has described the area as under "siege" and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City killed five people, with others still missing, the civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A number of civilians are still under the rubble," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it was "looking into the reports" of the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry, meanwhile, said an Israeli strike on the village of Almat north of Beirut killed at least 20 people including three children on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north toward Lebanon, escalating air strikes and sending in ground troops, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah. The Lebanese group said it was acting in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's main military backer the United States on October 15 warned that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless Israel improves aid delivery to the Gaza Strip within 30 days – a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the time that top US officials made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today."
  <br>
  <br>
  The demand came before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a UN-backed assessment warned famine is imminent in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter Gaza were now lower than at any time since October 2023, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military questioned the report's credibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, all assessments by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground," a military statement said, denouncing "partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  IPC says its process is "evidence-based" and ensures "a rigorous, neutral analysis."
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of UN agencies in early November described north Gaza as "under siege" and denied "basic aid and life-saving supplies."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to use the remaining weeks of his term to press for an end to the Gaza and Lebanon wars, a spokesman said on Thursday, before fellow mediator Qatar on Saturday said it had suspended its role in trying to broker a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement. (AFP)

    King Charles leads silence for UK war dead

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.
 <br>
  <br>
  The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among the dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  William said this week that the past year had been "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, it's been dreadful," he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."
  <br>
  <br>
  Queen Camilla, Charles's wife, missed the remembrance events due to a chest infection. (AFP)

    Bitcoin hits US$80,000 for the first time

<img alt="Speculators are betting on a Donald Trump presidency giving cryptocurrencies a boost. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778438_1_20241110213830.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as traders bet that Donald Trump's return to the White House will be good for the cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency passed US$80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12:00 pm (1200 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin reached US$75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of US$73,797 achieved in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first presidency, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a "historic transaction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin is listed continuously, including on Sundays. (AFP)

<img alt="Mark Cavendish says he intends to stay involved with cycling. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778424_1_20241110190800.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Cavendish sprinted to one last victory on Sunday as he took the Singapore Criterium in a signature surge to the line.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I really wanted that so bad," the 39-year-old Briton said after his 166th career victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm terribly emotional. I realised in the last five laps that this was the last 15 kilometres of my career. I passed the flamme rouge for the last time in my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming out of the last bend, Cavendish, who holds the record for most stage wins in the Tour de France, briefly latched onto the wheel of defending champion Jasper Philipsen before pulling away. The Manxman had time to glance back before raising his arms in triumph one last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975, having matched the Belgian's mark in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was so on the limit. I didn't race since the Tour de France so I am missing sharpness," said Cavendish who returned to the saddle to finish third in the Saitama Criterium on November 2, clinched by Biniam Girmay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Criterium, organised by the Tour de France, covered 25 laps of a street circuit. Cavendish stayed in the peloton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was nervous about crashing, or something like that; not that there is anything wrong with that but I really wanted to finish," said Cavendish.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he intended to stay involved with cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love this sport. I've always loved it," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Tour de France isn't just a bike race it's the biggest annual sports event in the world, it's what children dream of. It's what adults dream of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling is such a form of freedom. It's a way to be however you want to be. It has so much potential as a sport, as a mode of transport, as a pastime. I will do anything I can to help this move forward." (AFP)

 The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said on Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high," Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometres per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. (AFP)

 Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Edison Research projected on Saturday, completing a sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive Electoral College victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, who had secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House by early on Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris' 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Arizona, Trump won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states - and narrowly lost North Carolina, winning 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 74.6 million votes nationwide, or 50.5 percent, to Harris' 70.9 million, or 48 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on January 6, Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on January 20. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of US$10 billion in new deals at a business forum in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo told the China-Indonesia business forum that Jakarta wants to be part of Beijing's emergence as not only an economic but also a "civilisational power".
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration – not confrontation – is the way for peace and prosperity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the forum, Gao Yunlong, chairperson of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push for new achievements in bilateral trade and investment cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides should set an example of win-win cooperation among developing countries, Gao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Indonesia agreed to strengthen cooperation in key sectors, including lithium, new energy vehicles, green energy and tourism, according to a joint statement which was released after a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prabowo on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian leader on Sunday wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to the United States and then to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits. (Agencies)

    Make future shoebox homes bigger: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo calls on the government to add 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778412_1_20241110162312.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group has suggested that future housing units replacing subdivided homes should be larger than the minimum size proposed by the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his Policy Address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to eradicate substandard subdivided units and introduce “basic housing units”. The government said each unit must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sze Lai-shan, deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), said on Sunday officials should consider adding 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements, to ensure a suitable environment for families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one cares how many members are in 8 square metres, then it could be three or four people in 8 square metres. That would be too small and too inhumane for them," Sze said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With reference with the standard of public housing, if they are overcrowded, the living space for each person is 5.5 to 7 square metres, they would need to be rehoused to better places by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested the government put together a timetable for legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while officials have made it clear that those affected by the phasing out of substandard subdivided units would be rehoused, some residents remained jittery.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tenant surnamed Wong, whose unit is regarded as substandard and will be regulated under the new legislation, said he is unsure what will happen next.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only hope for the government to be able to make plans on rehousing arrangements for us. I am happy as long as the rent is not higher than what I am paying now, which is HK$2,890," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cage home tenant, surnamed Fong, who lives in a flat that features 35 bedspaces, called on the government to build more public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am now paying a monthly rent of HK$2,700. The Policy Address did not mention cage homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government should speed up rehousing us, and build more public housing for us lower-class people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also said the government could provide rent or relocation subsidy for residents.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the government's plan to launch a community mediation pilot scheme will resolve conflicts between neighbours, saving both time and money.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was unveiled in the Policy Address to promote a culture of mediation through the training of community workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Lam said the pilot scheme can help settle disputes in people's daily lives, such as noise and water leaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In court, there's only one winner, it's like a life-or-death situation, which sometimes isn't the best solution. Both sides might have some valid points, and it's rarely a case of one side being entirely right and the other entirely wrong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mediation saves time while court proceedings are a lengthy process, with significant psychological pressures."
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of efforts to promote mediation to resolve conflicts, the justice chief said last week the government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, saying it would save time and reduce costs for all parties involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Olympic tennis champion Zheng Qinwen narrowly missed the title in her WTA Finals debut, losing to Coco Gauff of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After the two players split the first two sets, Gauff came from 2-0 and 5-3 down in the final set and was two points from defeat at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet she took the set to a tiebreaker and won the first six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng threatened a comeback but Gauff took the victory off her third match point with a forehand winner as she came into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I was like a couple of points away from losing, but I just tried to stay in the moment honestly, and I'm really proud of myself," said Gauff, who's the first American to win the Finals since Serena Williams in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng was looking to complete a season in which she reached a grand slam final for the first time at the Australian Open and delivered China’s first Olympic tennis singles gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The match today, it’s just a couple of important points,” Zheng said. “The match was very close."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added, "And then I had a great season. It's my first time in the WTA Finals. Even though the final did not go in my way, I still got a lot of things to learn." (Agencies)

    'Low-altitude economy has huge potential in HK'

<img alt="Elizabeth Quat, left, says many mainland cities have been developing low-altitude economies for a long time, so Hong Kong can't fall behind. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778392_1_20241110122321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said Hong Kong can't afford to fall behind the rest of the world in developing a low-altitude economy, adding that the market could exceed HK$1 trillion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Quat, who's also the founding president of the Greater Bay Area Low-Altitude Economy Alliance, said she has met with a government working group on the matter, and the authorities plan to accept applications of pilot projects by the end of this year and unveil them next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that many mainland cities have been developing low-altitude economies for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some food-delivery agencies want to roll this out in Hong Kong, but of course, we have to try it first. They're in discussions with the authorities about where they can test it out. There are also delivery agencies that want to see if they can deliver from one point to another," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some companies are very creative, making drones that can inspect buildings, repair and maintain walls, or even wash windows. In fact, drones can even help with firefighting, rescue work and disaster relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that low-altitude services like medicine delivery would be a huge benefit especially for the elderly and those living in outlying islands and village homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the possibility of services outside of Hong Kong, Quat suggested that the government first consider cooperating with Guangdong and Macau to offer helicopter rides for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said cross-border food delivery won't be feasible because of food-safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to general safety concerns, Quat said she thinks drones could be safer than driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many traffic accidents on the road, and if you are stuck in a traffic jam, you can only move forward, but not backwards. However, if you look at the sky, it's really infinite. You can have many different altitudes," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sky is so big that we can divide it into different heights such as 100 metres, 200 metres and 300 metres to fly different things. There could be different altitudes set for people, cargo, helicopters and rescue. These problems can all be solved technically."

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said market sentiment has improved due to declining interest rates and measures to stabilise the economy, despite slower economic growth in the third quarter.

  "We expect that Hong Kong's economy will continue to maintain momentum for the rest of this year, with the full-year economic growth projected to be close to the lower end of the original forecast range," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 1.8 percent in the three months ending September on a year-on-year basis, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a 3.3 percent growth in the April-to-June period. Officials are forecasting full-year growth of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will sign agreements with 17 more strategic enterprises – from the mainland, the US and Europe – on Monday to establish or expand their businesses here.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies are involved in fields such as AI, big data and new energy, and 90 percent of them plan to set up headquarters in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together with the first two batches of nearly 50 strategic enterprises, Chan said they will bring HK$42 billion in investment to Hong Kong and create more than 17,000 jobs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday, replacing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 as a storm moved away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10am, Severe Typhoon Yinxing was estimated to be around 400 kilometres south-southwest of the SAR and is projected to move slowly towards the seas south of Hainan Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said local winds have weakened gradually, and that the Standby Signal No. 1 would be cancelled when Yinxing no longer poses a threat to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the government advised the public to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it'll be mainly cloudy with a few showers at first on Sunday, followed by sunny periods in the next couple of days before the weather becomes unsettled in the middle of the week.

 The Observatory said it would replace the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 with a Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement just before 9am, the Observatory said Severe Typhoon Yinxing had continued to weaken in the past two hours, and was gradually moving away from the coast of Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, prompting some classes and special programmes to be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department advised the public not to take children or family members to centres providing after school care programmes or elderly services centres on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Education Bureau said early on Sunday that kindergarten morning classes and full-day sessions were suspended, along with schools for the physically or intellectually disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, afternoon kindergarten classes will be held as normal.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia coach Joe Schmidt hailed Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii as an "aerial freak" after the cross-code capture marked his first senior game of rugby union by starring in the Wallabies' thrilling 42-37 win over England at Twickenham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Suaalii, a multi million-dollar convert from rugby league, was named player of the match after posing problems for England under the high ball, with the outside centre's sublime pass also sending in full-back Tom Wright for the first of the Wallabies' five tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead changed hands four times late on before, with England 37-35 ahead, Australia replacement back Max Jorgensen went over for the last of the game's 10 tries in the 84th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmidt, reflecting on Suaalii's performance, said: "I thought he was strong. I thought he was really well supported by Lenny Ikitau. Lenny was outstanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joseph obviously got a few kick-offs back for us. He's a bit of an aerial freak, but at the same time, it was a good learning experience for Joseph as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns had been expressed about whether pitching Suaalii into the cauldron of a Twickenham crowd of over 81,000 was a wise move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Schmidt, a former Ireland coach, said: "I know there were some doubts expressed about him being selected and the risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people would now see the opportunity of involving a young man like that, " the New Zealander added.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was only Australia's second victory in 12 games against England and first over their old rivals at Twickenham since they knocked the Red Rose brigade out of the 2015 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also followed a woeful return in this year's southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, where Australia lost five of their six games, and marked an ideal start to their Grand Slam tour, with struggling Wales next up for the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three tries in the last five minutes to win it, lose it and win it, it was so up and down, but one thing that stayed up was the effort from our team," said Schmidt.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Jamie George, meanwhile, said the hosts had produced an "unacceptable" display after they missed 35 tackles against the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was England's fifth straight defeat by a leading rugby nation and followed last week's agonising 24-22 loss to New Zealand in their November opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  England coach Steve Borthwick lamented lost opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a game we should have won. We were in a position to win multiple times," Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you turn over that much ball and make the game that unstructured against a team with that much pace, you're giving them opportunities. We gave them far too many opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, New Zealand ended Ireland's 19-match winning streak at Lansdowne Road, running out 23-13 victors over the world ranked number one side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Argentina launched their November international campaign with a ninth successive victory over Italy, winning 50-18 in Udine, and Antoine Dupont guided France to a 52-12 win over visiting Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, the Springboks play Scotland at Murrayfield, and Wales host Fiji in Cardiff. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat after blowing the lead to lose 2-1 at Brighton, allowing Liverpool to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City had not suffered defeat in the league for nearly a year prior to losing at Bournemouth last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after also exiting the League Cup to Tottenham and being on the end of a 4-1 thrashing by Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola has lost four straight matches for the first time in his illustrious managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions looked set to bounce back from their chastening night in Lisbon on Tuesday when Erling Haaland prodded in his 15th goal of the season at the second attempt after his initial effort was saved by Bart Verbruggen.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, though, were opened up at will in the second half and were finally punished by a pair of Brighton substitutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro fired in the equaliser after City failed to clear in a goalmouth scramble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt O'Riley has had to wait for his Premier League debut after suffering a serious ankle injury days after sealing a move from Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Danish international marked his bow in style when he slotted in from Pedro's pass seven minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not able to do 90 minutes right now. Four defeats in a row. We have to change things quick," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe after seven years winning six Premier Leagues, maybe one year another team deserves it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool kicked off at Anfield just 30 minutes later and quickly capitalised on City's latest slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a superb counter-attack in the 20th minute, Mohamed Salah was sent racing clear by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Salah tumbled to the turf under pressure, Darwin Nunez seized on the loose ball and fired high into the net from an acute angle for his third goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's composed finish in the 84th minute after another rapid Liverpool raid sealed their ninth win in 11 league games and 15th victory in 17 matches in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first English title since 2020, Liverpool, who finished a distant third to City last season, have been revitalised following Arne Slot's arrival from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp as manager in the close-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa have slumped to eighth place after losing their last four games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves ended a wait since April for a Premier League win by beating fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to move off the foot of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary O'Neil was under huge pressure to deliver after a 13-game winless run in the top flight and got the perfect start when Pablo Sarabia swept home Matheus Cunha's pass for Wolves' fastest ever Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cunha smashed home a stunning second goal himself early in the second period to give Wolves a vital three points, which sees Southampton replace them at the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's huge for us. He has such ability," said O'Neil on Cunha's influence. "A big win for us and Matheus Cunha had a big say in it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham moved into seventh by inflicting more misery on Crystal Palace with a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe put Fulham ahead and Palace's Daichi Kamada saw red for a wild lunge on Kenny Tete before Harry Wilson wrapped up the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa scored a brace as Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice the in-form Cherries led through Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bees have taken 16 points from a possible 18 at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford quickly levelled on both occasions through Wissa and Mikkel Damsgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wissa then completed the comeback with his seventh goal in eight league appearances this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham and Everton did little to quell the discontent among both fanbases in a 0-0 draw. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cycling great Mark Cavendish announced his retirement from the sport on Saturday, writing on social media that his final race will be Sunday's Tour de France Singapore Criterium.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Sunday will be the final race of my professional cycling career," wrote the 39-year-old British rider, the record stage winner on the Tour de France with 35, in a post on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling has given me so much and I love the sport. I've always wanted to make a difference in it and now I am ready to see what the next chapter has in store for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am lucky enough to have done what I love for almost 20 years and I can now say that I have achieved everything that I can on the bike," the rider from the Isle of Man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish won the world road race title in 2011 and an omnium silver medal at the 2016 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over two decades he won 165 races, including 17 stages in the Giro d'Italia and three in the Vuelta a Espana. (AFP)

    Famine looming in north Gaza: UN-backed report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famine is looming in the northern Gaza Strip amid increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid, a UN-backed assessment said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  On October 17, the body projected that the number of people in Gaza facing "catastrophic" food insecurity between November and April 2025 would reach 345,000, or 16 percent of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report classified that as IPC Phase 5 – a situation when "starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since that report, conditions have worsened in the north of Gaza, with a collapse of food systems, a drop in humanitarian aid and critical water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, the committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can therefore be assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas," it read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been devastated by Israel's retaliatory assault launched after the October 7 attack last year by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces have intensified their operations in large swathes of the Gaza Strip's north since early October, where evacuation orders are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter the Gaza Strip were now lower than at any time since October 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Access to food continues to deteriorate, with prices of essentials on the black market soaring. Cooking gas rose by 2,612 percent, diesel by 1,315 percent and wood by 250 percent, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concurrent with the extremely high and increasing prices of essential items has been the total collapse of livelihoods to be able to purchase or barter for food and other basic needs," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body expressed concern over Israel's cutting ties last month with the UN aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA), warning of "extremely serious consequences for humanitarian operations" in Gaza. (AFP)

 Devastating flooding in South Sudan is affecting around 1.4 million people, with more than 379,000 displaced, according to a United Nations update that warned about an upsurge in malaria.

  Aid agencies have said that the world's youngest country, highly vulnerable to climate change, is in the grip of its worst flooding in decades, mainly in the north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said about 1.4 million people were affected by floods in 43 counties and the disputed Abyei region, which is claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over 379,000 individuals are displaced in 22 counties and Abyei," it added in a statement issued late on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surge in malaria has been reported in several states, it said, "overwhelming the health system and exacerbating the situation and impact in flood-hit areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, the world's youngest nation has remained plagued by chronic instability, violence and economic stagnation as well as climate disasters such as drought and floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Bank said last month that the latest floods were "worsening an already critical humanitarian situation marked by severe food insecurity, economic decline, continued conflict, disease outbreaks, and the repercussions of the Sudan conflict," which has seen several hundred thousand people pour into South Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than seven million people are food insecure in South Sudan and 1.65 million children are malnourished, according to the UN's World Food Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country also faces another period of political paralysis after the president's office announced in September yet another extension to a transitional period agreed in a 2018 peace deal, delaying elections by two years to December 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key provisions of the transitional agreement remain unfulfilled – including the creation of a constitution and the unification of the rival forces of President Salva Kiir and his foe Reik Machar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delay has left South Sudan's partners and the United Nations exasperated, with UN envoy Nicholas Haysom on Thursday describing it as a "regrettable development."
  <br>
  <br>
  All local and international parties involved "must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last, and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve," added Haysom.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources but the vital source of revenue was decimated in February when an export pipeline was damaged in neighbouring war-torn Sudan. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hotly tipped Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki was on Saturday given the green light to follow in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and move to Major League Baseball.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki, widely regarded as one of the best players in Japan's domestic league, will be posted for a potential move to the US, his club the Chiba Lotte Marines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means MLB clubs will have the right to bid for the 23-year-old right-hander this offseason, in an agreement between the Japanese and American leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki threw a perfect game in April 2022 and was part of the Japan team that won last year's World Baseball Classic alongside Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani won his first MLB championship last month when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki said he had "nothing but gratitude" to the Marines for agreeing to post him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You only get one baseball career and I don't want to have any regrets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meet the expectations of everyone who has pushed me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki's father and grandparents were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  His house was swept away when the earthquake unleashed a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing, and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. (AFP)

    Rome's Trevi Fountain opens temporary tourist catwalk

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="For the time being at least, people can view the famous architecture from a completely different perspective. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778343_1_20241109213345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspended walkway providing tourists an up-close view of Rome's Trevi Fountain was unveiled on Saturday, a temporary addition while the famous "La Dolce Vita" site undergoes cleaning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Baroque masterpiece constructed on the facade of a palace is one of the most popular sites in Rome for tourists, who strain over the crowds to throw their coins into its water.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the fountain is being cleaned to remove limestone deposits and grime, however, the walkway positioned over its basin will accommodate some 130 people at a time to take a closer look.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will give tourists "an experience not ruined by excessive crowding," said Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to give everybody the opportunity to admire the fountain and to do this from a unique perspective, because what you can see from the walkway, you will never be able to see normally," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French tourist Franc Petretto, 50, was one of the first to walk across the passageway, calling the view "wonderful and very, very beautiful."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even without the water flowing inside the fountain, you can really see that the architecture is serious... and that's really very pleasing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Micaela di Caterina, a 32-year-old visiting from Argentina, agreed, saying the up-close look at the intricate sculptures of Oceanus, father of the river gods, and his sea-horses was "incredible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, she acknowledged, it was "kind of weird" to be walking over the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fountain – where Anita Ekberg frolicked in Federico Fellini's 1960 film "La Dolce Vita" – last got a thorough scrub a decade ago during an 18-month renovation sponsored by Fendi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, too, the Italian fashion house installed a plexiglass bridge above the basin allowing tourists to still admire the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current work involves removing limestone deposits on the fountain's facade, which can turn black with time, while removing loose material between stones where vegetation grows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists won't be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the fountain's basin – where tradition has it that visitors who do so will return to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, a small pool set up next to the walkway has been installed to receive spare change.
  <br>
  <br>
  That pool "allows us to avoid throwing coins, which, without water, would damage the fountain," Gualtieri said, adding that anyone doing so would be fined.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also allows the flow of donations to Rome's needy to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every week, authorities recuperated some 10,000 euros in coins from Trevi Fountain, which were donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals, said Gaultieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud not to have interrupted such important work for those in difficulty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway will be up until the cleaning is complete, sometime in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaultieri said city officials were still considering a possible ticketing system to control the crowds at Trevi Fountain once the cleaning is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers are expected to surge next year for the Jubilee, a holy year held by the Catholic Church around once every 25 years, with some 30 million people expected in Rome and the Vatican. (AFP)

    Gaza rescuers say 14 killed in Israeli strikes

<img alt="Israel's military offensive in Gaza has reduced the territory to rubble. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778335_1_20241109201759.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday that Israeli air strikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north.
 <br>
  <br>
  An air strike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Younis, killing at least nine people, including children and women, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second air strike killed five people, including children, and injured about 22 when "Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school," which had been turned into a shelter for "thousands of displaced people" in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed "dozens of terrorists" in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip," the military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which included those who died and were killed in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack, militants abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,508 people, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

    Pakistani separatists kill 26 in railway station blast

<img alt="The huge blast was aimed at military personnel waiting on the platform at Quetta station. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778329_1_20241109185345.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bombing claimed by Pakistani separatists killed 26 people including 14 soldiers at a railway station in the southwestern Balochistan province, a hospital spokesman said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blast hit as passengers waited on a platform at the main railway station in the provincial capital Quetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fourteen members of the army and 12 civilians were killed," said Wasim Baig, spokesman for Quetta's Sandeman Provincial Hospital, raising an earlier toll of 25 provided by police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-six members of the security forces and 14 civilians were wounded, the spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Journalists saw pools of blood and ripped backpacks at the scene, where a large metal sheet protecting passengers from the elements had been blown off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite frequent attacks in Balochistan the toll of Saturday's blast was particularly high for the southwestern province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train station explosion hit at around 8:45 am (0345 GMT) and was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), one of the area's main separatist groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack "was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta railway station... after completing a course at the Infantry School," the BLA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press of Pakistan, the official news agency, cited railway officials as saying the blast happened near the ticket booth when two trains were scheduled to depart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the attackers "will pay a heavy price," according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Quetta station, police said they were working to determine the cause of the blast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we reached here, initially it appeared that some explosive had perhaps been hidden or left in the luggage. But now we think it may be a suicide bomber," Muhammad Baloch, a senior local police official, told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters, rescuers and passengers were working through abandoned luggage on the platform, guarded by heavily armed members of the security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militants have in the past targeted energy projects with foreign financing, accusing outsiders of exploiting the resource-rich region while excluding residents in the poorest part of Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the BLA claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants who killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls to hit the region. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It's 365 days until the 15th National Games, and Hong Kong kicked off a countdown ceremony to celebrate, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next year – from November 9 to 21  –  along with Guangdong and Macau.  It will also be the first time the countrywide competition will have multiple host regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight of the 34 competitive events will take place in the HKSAR, including fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball, and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the countdown ceremony at government headquarters, Chief Executive John Lee said that the government is working hard to prepare for the Games and will carry out several trial runs, starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's hopeful that the multi-host cities approach can boost cooperation within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay development plays a key strategic role in the country’s new development framework. By hosting the Games together, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are deepening their collaboration in areas like culture, sports, economy, and society, promoting high-quality development across the Greater Bay Area. It’s particularly meaningful for the three places to work together towards building a top-notch Bay Area in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, Hong Kong will also host four competitive events for the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special Olympic Games in December next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted the government will use various channels to educate people about the events and build excitement, including banners, exhibitions, as well as activities in communities and schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities plan to open up more volunteer positions for the Games, saying so far 30,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's National Games will mark Hong Kong's eighth time participating in the countrywide competition, where the SAR has already won 47 medals, including 11 gold.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, a countdown ceremony was also held at the Haixinsha Asian Games Park in Guangzhou, where Lee and Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng gave video speeches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Guangzhou, Sun Zhiyang, said the city will treat the one-year countdown mark as a fresh starting point and promised to stick to a green, shared, open, and connected approach to organising the Games, while making sure the event is safe, simple and still amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, said the one-year mark shows that preparations for the Games are in the final stages and that everything is going smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will keep our promises and give our best in preparations, including building quality venues and essential facilities, coordinating, running trial runs, and providing excellent services, security, and promotion, as well as improving city infrastructure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the State General Administration of Sports Gao Zhidan for his part said organising work are now at a critical stage and urged Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau to step up their coordination and teamwork.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Beijing on Saturday, according to Xinhua news agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly sworn-in Indonesian leader landed in China on Friday, kicking off his first overseas tour seeking a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi held a welcome ceremony for Prabowo at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, where the bilateral talks took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes the visit will take bilateral relations to a "new level".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready to work with Indonesia to take this visit as an opportunity to consolidate high-level political mutual trust," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo is also meeting Premier Li Qiang and number three official Zhao Leji on his trip, which ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will travel onwards to Washington, at the invitation of US President Joe Biden, as part of a world tour which will also include Peru, Brazil and Britain. (AFP)

 The observatory said the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, but it expects the chance of issuing a higher warning signal to be rather low.
 <br>
  <br>
  It issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, as Super Typhoon Yinxing gradually edges closer to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Yinxing adopts a more northerly track closer to the Pearl River Estuary, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force at least until Sunday 10am, and depending on the degree of weakening of local winds, the observatory will then consider lowering it to the Standby Signal No 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau announced that kindergartens, and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities are suspended on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A worker on Saturday died in an industrial accident at a construction site near Tai Wai MTR Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a call about the incident around 1:30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initial investigation found that the man was crushed by a cage lift while trying to move items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worker fell unconscious and was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A representative of a concern group said it's believed that the deceased worker was grabbing materials out of the cage lift, when the lift suddenly moved and crushed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said there have been similar incidents in the past, but isn’t sure if this accident was due to human error or a mechanical malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that after the last similar accident, many construction sites improved worker protection by adding extra safety design features to the cage lifts, making operational faults less likely. But I'm not sure if this particular cage lift at this site has any issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  Contractor Hip Seng Construction was in charge of The Pavilia Farm construction site where the accident took place. Its spokesman said the company was deeply saddened by the accident, and expressed its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company will work with the sub-contractor to assist his family, and cooperate with the government to look into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it has deployed staff to the scene and is investigating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner urged construction sites to inspect their lifts' steel cables at least once per week and to install a safety device that can prevent lifts from falling even if the cables break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute added that such lifts should never be used to carry workers and should be locked down once the doors are open.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the authorities will continue to work with all sectors to enhance patriotic education in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a photo exhibition marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", Chan said the move was crucial to the development of the aviation industry in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uprising occurred on November 9, 1949, when 12 aircraft from two Nationalist-controlled airlines took off from Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, deviated from their scheduled flight paths, and instead went to join the new Communist government in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  After touching down, they were all given a hero’s welcome. Zhou Enlai, the newly appointed premier, hosted a banquet in their honor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident would become a watershed moment in Chinese history, and later deemed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou as "the starting point of China's civil aviation of the people with unlimited potential".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through photo exhibitions and a microfilm, this event promotes major events to the development of the country's civil aviation industry. It's of great significance, telling the story of Hong Kong's unique contribution to this development", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR government had been using different events and methods to promote patriotism and enhance people's sense of national identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Museum of History will set up a permanent exhibition about the history of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", and the government will be in touch with mainland authorities on relevant materials to display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air China's director Cui Xiaofeng reaffirmed the airline's commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle, and said it will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have made contributions in promoting Hong Kong's economic prosperity, social harmony and stability," he told the same event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We will] support and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub in the future, strengthening Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a super value-adder."

    Northern Metropolis up for tender starting next year

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778285_1_20241109124354.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development revealed that the government is aiming to put at least one sizeable land parcel from the Northern Metropolis up for tender next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last month's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee revealed his administration has earmarked three land parcels of 10 to 20 hectares each as pilot sites, in a bid to speed up land development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three sites are located in San Tin Technopole, Hung Shui Kiu and Fanling North.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernadette Linn told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that the government will conduct a survey to assess the market's interest at the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By then, we will have a list of questions for the developers. We will also tell them the exact location of these three land plots, the infrastructure and facilities that we expect for each land," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because we have to let them know exactly which location we are referring to and what the government requires."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Linn also noted that former Chief Executive CY Leung has raised concerns towards the government's plan to keep increasing land supply, saying that it would cause a heavier financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to roll out 7,000 hectares of ready-to-use land up by 2048 - three thousand of which will be available in the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development secretary, however, brushed off his concern. She believes that Leung, who's now a vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, just wants the government to be prudent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the public can see how determined we are in terms of land production. But we're also emphasising that we will be prudent, and I realise the word 'prudent' is what we have in common."
  <br>
  <br>
  She went on to say that some people are worried that the authorities might be reckless in rolling out ready-to-use land by ignoring the vacancy rate and housing prices at a time when the economy is not in its best shape.

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers maintain their perfect start to the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778284_1_20241109122355.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their perfect start to the NBA season in sensational style on Friday, seizing a 41-point halftime lead on the way to a 136-117 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 10-0, ending the Warriors' five-game winning streak and handing them their first road defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The damage was done early, the Cavs' 83 first-half points tying a franchise record for most scored in any half and their 41-point halftime lead the biggest in team history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the Warriors' second-ranked defense, the Cavs posted their fifth game of the young season with at least 130 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ties a team record for the most 130-plus point games for an entire season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten-0 is a magic number," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. "We're playing really good basketball and I'm just really pleased where the group is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was worried about tonight - they're 7-1 and rolling and they're coming in here, they're champions and they're going to try and knock our block off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 27 points, Evan Mobley added 23 and Ty Jerome chipped in 20 off the bench as six Cavs players scored in double figures against a Warriors defense that came in ranked second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, they kept the potentially explosive Warriors offense in check, opening the game on a 20-2 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way we came out tonight, that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins with nine points and Stephen Curry with seven were the only Warriors starters to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State were able to adjust after the break, out-scoring the Cavs 41-29 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors, however, were in too deep a hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 21 points off the bench, Curry finished with 12 on five-of-10 shooting, making just one from three-point range. (AFP)

    'Xia urges HK business sector to find new markets'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs emphasised the important role of the business sector in boosting the city's economy and improving people's livelihood, according to Hong Kong Productivity Council chairman Sunny Tan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, met representatives of the Hong Kong business sector in Shenzhen on Friday, with Chief Executive John Lee also in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Tan, who was at the closed-door meeting, said Xia urged the business sector to take the initiative to discover new business opportunities and new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do need to have a determination to make change. It's not about just the government, but in all our sectors... We all need to look at the external environment, look into the development progress of China and see what we got to do from our side," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, put in more investment into innovation technology. How do we maneuver the new dynamics of the external environment on our supply chain management? All this is very important and we have to make that change."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Executive Councillor Jeffrey Lam told the same radio programme that lower interest rates would benefit the city, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, which led to major banks in the SAR also cutting their Hong Kong dollar best lending rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're going to see maybe more activity in the property market. As for the SMEs, the rate cut will reduce their spending on interest," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will help their business and also their cash flow. I hope by seeing more interest reduction, maybe more to come, our business activity will get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that he expects there would not be many changes in terms of US policies towards China, after Donald Trump won the US presidential election against Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce plans to visit the US next year to meet with business representatives and potentially secure new business opportunities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation rate slowed in October, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in October, down from 0.4 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as authorities on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to lift local government debt and boost spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, Beijing began unveiling fresh measures aimed at boosting economic activity,  including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. (AFP)

 The observatory said on Saturday it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm, as Super Typhoon Yinxing edges closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said local winds are expected to strengthen later in the day, with winds on high ground occasionally reaching gale force.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said Yinxing will skirt more than 300 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Sunday morning, so a tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cross-harbour swim was originally scheduled for Sunday, but the organiser decided to call off the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the potential for inclement weather brought by Tropical Storm Yinxing and to ensure the safety of all swimmers, under careful consideration, the organisers have made the difficult decision to cancel the New World Harbour Race 2024," it wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that all qualified swimmers will receive a full refund.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher, with investors upbeat about the business agenda of President-elect Donald Trump.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished at fresh records on Friday, ending a buoyant week on a positive note prompted by relief at the swift resolution of the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 finished at 5,995.54, up 0.4 percent for the day and 4.7 percent for the week as markets welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's growth agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 43,988.99, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.1 percent to 19,286.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're in this honeymoon period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, which we saw in previous election cycles," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin thinks the strength in US equities could extend through the rest of 2024, but cautioned that worries about overvaluation will grow if the market keeps rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have greeted Trump's win in anticipation that tax cuts and regulatory relief will more than offset the ills of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appointees are also expected to permit more corporate dealmaking, boosting mergers and acquisitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday marked the debut in the Dow of chip company Nvidia, which declined 0.8 percent and paint company Sherwin-Williams, which rose 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbnb fell 8.7 percent after reporting earnings that narrowly missed analyst expectations. Briefing.com said "investments beyond the company's core markets are adding cost, casting a cloud on otherwise uplifting trends from the quarter." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ineos Britannia has been accepted as the Challenger of Record for the next edition of the America's Cup sailing competition, organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory against their British opponents on October 19 and the challenge was lodged immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) and Emirates Team New Zealand are pleased to confirm that the RNZYS has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 38th America's Cup (AC38) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Limited, represented by Ineos Britannia, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC38," said a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton said: "The 38th America's Cup effectively started the moment the team crossed the finish line in Barcelona on 19th October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very exciting to have continuity with the Challenger of Record, Ineos Britannia, to continue to build the scale of the America's Cup globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AC38 would be a "multi-challenger event." At this year's America's Cup, Ineos Britannia won a qualifying event that enabled them to take on the defending champions for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Yacht Squadron said it would "work alongside The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron" to deliver the protocol for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The class of yacht will be the AC75 and teams will be restricted to building one boat.
  <br>
  <br>
  No date has yet been set but the statement from the organisers said it is "intended that the AC38 match be held within three years of the completion of the AC37 match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team New Zealand won the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time to end the best-of-13 series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British boat was skippered by four-time Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie and is bankrolled by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemical group Ineos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Global food prices rose in October to their highest level in 18 months, with a sharp increase in the cost of vegetable oil, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of a basket of food commodities, reached 127.4 points last month, a two-percent increase from September.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest since April 2023 but still 20.5 percent lower than the peak reached in March 2022 following Russia's assault on agricultural powerhouse Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vegetable oil prices increased by 7.3 percent in October, reaching a two-year high due to lower production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sugar prices rose 2.6 percent, dairy was up 2.5 percent and cereals gained 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meat was the only commodity to fall, down 0.3 percent from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAO is an agency of the United Nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nations League football match between France and Israel will go ahead as planned in Paris next week despite the clashes that erupted in Amsterdam following a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax, the French interior minister said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game at the Stade de France on Thursday has been identified as a potential flashpoint but Bruno Retailleau said France would not "back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some are calling for the France-Israel match to be relocated. I do not accept this," Retailleau wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "France is not backing down because that would amount to giving up in the face of threats of violence and anti-Semitism," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retailleau said he had asked Paris police chief Laurent Nunez to take the necessary security measures for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawmaker from Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) party, Julien Odoul, on Thursday suggested moving the match to the island of Corsica.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence flared in Amsterdam after a Europa League match on Thursday between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli, Dutch and European leaders on Friday condemned the "anti-Semitic" clashes and Israel sent rescue planes for its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema said the violence represented an "explosion" of anti-Semitism that has "not been seen in a long time," describing "hit and run" attacks on Maccabi supporters by "hooligans on scooters." (AFP)

    Treat SAR as your home, Xia tells business leaders

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs has urged the local business community to see the SAR as their home, while consolidating the city's traditional advantages, during a closed-door exchange in Shenzhen, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), on Friday also told business magnates and entrepreneurs that they are the "main force" in promoting economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Business leaders] must stand firm in treating Hong Kong as their home and utilising Hong Kong to prosper, consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's traditional advantages," Xia was quoted as saying by the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's business community and entrepreneurs are the main force in promoting economic development. They have made outstanding contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and assisting in the country's modernisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said Xia told those at the exchange to support the SAR government in implementing its long-term development plans, and tell the good Hong Kong story and safeguard the city's international image, among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was in attendance with his principal officials, said his administration will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong to implement reforms and "break new ground" in the city's development, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Jonathan Choi, who was among 29 business leaders at the meeting, said discussions focused on their role in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Hong Kong's economy relies on entrepreneurs, [Xia] hopes that entrepreneurs will go all out and follow the central government's strategy," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters’ Association, said the Beijing official noted that the city had gone through trials and tribulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia said] the current situation in Hong Kong has been stable, and we should take advantage of this period of transitioning from stability to prosperity to do our best," Pui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other business leaders and property tycoons included Richard Li, who chairs Pacific Century Group; Peter Lee, co-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land; and Raymond Kwok, chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  They attended a full-day symposium and joined a dinner, with HKMAO executive deputy director Zhou Ji and the head of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, who also took part in the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a trip to Hong Kong in February, Xia also focused on the city's economic developments. Last month, the senior Beijing official separately met executives of Jardine Matheson and HSBC in Beijing.

    Majority of Gaza war dead women, children: UN probe

<img alt="The UN human rights office says about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778223_1_20241108220743.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN on Friday condemned the staggering number of civilians killed in Israel's war in Gaza, with women and children comprising nearly 70 percent of the thousands of fatalities it had managed to verify.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a fresh report, slammed by Israel, the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) detailed a raft of violations of international law since Hamas's deadly October 7 attack in Israel sparked the war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many could amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly even "genocide," it warned, demanding international efforts to prevent "atrocity crimes" and ensure accountability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Civilians in Gaza have borne the brunt of the attacks, including through the initial 'complete siege' of Gaza by Israeli forces," the UN said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Conduct by Israeli forces has caused unprecedented levels of killings, death, injury, starvation, illness and disease."
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed to "the Israeli government's continuing unlawful failures to allow, facilitate and ensure the entry of humanitarian aid, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and repeated mass displacement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva "categorically" rejected the report, decrying "the inherent obsession of OHCHR with the demonisation of Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza is now a rubble-strewn landscape," Ajith Sunghay, head of the UN rights office's activities in the Palestinian territories, said via video-link from Amman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within this dystopia of destruction and devastation, those alive are left injured, displaced and starving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's report also found that Hamas and other armed groups had committed widespread violations that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including seizing hostages, killings, torture and sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those violations, it said, were especially committed in connection with the October 7, 2023 attack, which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly of civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also tackled the contentious issue of the proportion of civilians among the nearly 43,500 people killed in Gaza so far, according to the health ministry in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies have been relying on death tolls provided by the authorities in Hamas-run Gaza due to lack of access. This has sparked harsh criticism from Israel but the UN has repeatedly said the figures are reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office said it had now managed to verify around 10,000 of the more than 34,500 people reportedly killed during the first six months of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so far found close to 70 percent to be children and women," Sunghay said, highlighting the stringent verification methodology that requires at least three separate sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the findings indicated "a systematic violation of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said 4,700 of the verified fatalities were children and 2,461 were women.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rights office found that about 80 percent of all the verified deaths in Gaza had occurred in Israeli attacks on residential buildings or similar housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children between the ages of five and nine made up the largest group of victims, with the youngest victim a one-day-old boy and the oldest a 97-year-old woman, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel says its operations in Gaza target militants and are in line with international law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Friday's report stressed that the verified deaths largely Gaza's demographic makeup rather than that of combatants.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, it said, clearly "raises concerns regarding compliance with the principle of distinction and reflect an apparent failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid, and in any event to minimise, incidental loss of civilian life."
  <br>
  <br>
  UN rights chief Volker Turk called on all countries to work to halt the violations and to ensure accountability, including through universal jurisdiction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential that there is due reckoning with respect to the allegations of serious violations of international law through credible and impartial judicial bodies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violence must stop immediately, the hostages and those arbitrarily detained must be released, and we must focus on flooding Gaza with humanitarian aid." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mayor of Amsterdam on Friday announced tighter security measures in the city after five people were hospitalised and 62 arrested as a result of clashes that erupted in Amsterdam overnight following a football match.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Several reports about last night's events in Amsterdam are circulating on social media," the city’s police said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police have launched a major investigation into multiple violent incidents," it said, adding that “the police are aware of reports regarding a possible hostage situation and missing persons but currently have no confirmation that this actually took place. This aspect is also under investigation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said fans had left Johan Cruyff Arena without incident after the Europa League match, which Ajax won 5-0 against Maccabi Tel Aviv, but that clashes erupted overnight in the city centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who had feared that clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli soccer club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halsema later said she was “ashamed” at what happened in the city, and  announced a temporary ban on protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli and Dutch leaders have condemned the violence. Israel initially ordered that two planes be sent to the Dutch capital to bring the football fans home, but later the prime minister's office said it would work on "providing civil aviation solutions for the return of our citizens”.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that “the harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked," and that Netanyahu "views the horrifying incident with utmost gravity." He demanded that the Dutch government take “vigorous and swift action" against those involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was "horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks on Israeli citizens", which he called "completely unacceptable".
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoof assured Netanyahu by phone that "the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted", he said in a statement on the social media platform X. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local bartender on Friday reigned supreme in a Greater Bay Area mixology competition, which showcased the best flairtenders from Macau and Guangdong province.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong International Mixology Showdown 2024, organised by the SAR's Bartenders Association, hosted its inaugural GBA region competition in conjunction with this year's International Wine and Spirits Fair held at the convention centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-six competitors from the two SARs, as well as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nansha, Jiangmen and Zhuhai, impressed the judges at the bar table with their flair and finesse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champion Kenneth Tsang, from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, said he was ecstatic to win on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a great opportunity to see other competitors from other [regions] because you can learn a lot during the competition because you can see every technique, skill and other things that you can't see in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we can join more competitions [in the future] to make friends with each other, communicate with other bars or restaurants to build [each other] up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bartenders Association's Ken Chau said the purpose of the event is to promote the exchange of bartending culture among the different regions, adding that more competitions can help elevate the SAR's status as a regional trading hub for wine and spirits.
  <br>
  <br>
  And even though the government has relaxed duties on liquor, Chau said many bars have suffered significantly due to different consumption habits in Hong Kong. He hopes that this will change soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The spirits tax doesn't help a lot of sales to be honest, but it does help start a new path, especially Chinese Baijius because Chinese Baijius will be the next big trend in Hong Kong," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's lawmakers have approved a bill to raise the ceiling on local government debt by six trillion yuan to replace existing hidden debts, an official said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation's top legislative body, the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), approved the bill during a meeting from November 4 to 8, said Xu Hongcai, vice chairman of the financial and economic affairs committee of the NPC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, who made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing, added that the debt swap would help resolve local debt risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same press conference, Finance Minister Lan Foan said "hidden debt" of local governments stood at 14.3 trillion yuan at the end of 2023, which authorities planned to trim to 2.3 trillion yuan by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan also said authorities will issue policies to support state sector purchases of unsold apartments and reclaim undeveloped residential land from property developers, as well as replenish the capital of big state banks, but did not give details on the size or timing of those measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV described the move as China's "most powerful debt reduction measure in recent years", adding the move would free "up space for local governments to better develop the economy and protect people's livelihood".
  <br>
  <br>
  At the closing NPC meeting, lawmakers also voted to adopt a preschool education law, and revised laws on anti-money laundering, the protection of cultural relics, and mineral resources, as well as an energy law.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping signed seven presidential orders to promulgate the laws and the decisions. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 2,500 people on Friday attended a job fair, where about 70 companies are looking for top talent in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fair – the second recruitment event that the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association has held this year – is offering over 1,500 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s founder Shang Hailong pointed out that this edition of the fair is “totally different” in terms of its reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, this job fair is totally different. We cooperated with the Hong Kong Talent Engage Office, we cooperated with Oases (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises)…Different committees joined this job fair, that’s a big difference.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang added that more than 4,000 people had signed up for the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property giant Sun Hung Kai Properties was one of the companies offering jobs at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonnie Soo, assistant manager of human resources, revealed that the group is targetting candidates from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The businesses of Sun Hung Kai Properties are not just in Hong Kong – we have a lot of property projects on the mainland. We recruit people from the mainland to understand more about the customers there – what they need and what they want."
  <br>
  <br>
  One jobseeker from the mainland, Scarlett Chen, said she hopes to find a better job at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the mainland, for example for the IT industry, there is an age limit. And in recent years, the economic situation wasn’t good, [so] there are no promotion prospects or wage increases.”

 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 12.40pm today as Tropical Cyclone Yinxing edges closer to the coast of southern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the T1 signal is expected to remain in place until at least noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Yinxing and the Pearl River Estuary, intensity of Yinxing and the local wind conditions, the Observatory will then assess the need for issuance of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A tropical cyclone warning signal is expected to remain in force at least until Sunday morning."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that under the combined effect of Yinxing and the northeast monsoon, it will be windier over the coast of Guangdong and on high ground over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seas will be rough with swells and there will be showers, the observatory said.

    Save time and cut costs with mediation clauses: SJ

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said incorporating mediation clauses in all future government contracts would not only save time, but also reduce costs for all parties involved.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on the final day of Hong Kong Legal Week, Lam stressed the government's intention to promote mediation as a means of resolving conflicts amicably.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is willing to take the lead in the hope that we can cultivate the culture in the society as a whole. So that when the people encounter disputes, the first thing that they would consider is not to go to court, but instead to try to resolve this view by mediation, by a means which in our belief is more economical, more time-saving, and resulting in a more harmonious result,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief added he wants the government to be an example for the private sector to follow as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lam said he had initial discussions during his first meeting with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Expert Committee, composed of three advisory boards, with 17 legal experts and scholars from prominent international, mainland, and local legal organisations and universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his hope to leverage this platform for greater capacity-building efforts and to emphasise more practical applications when developing training programmes and strategies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei on Friday said she hopes to raise public awareness of people with special needs, after a Thai restaurant refused to admit her because of her wheelchair.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the boccia player said she was refused entry to a Causeway Bay restaurant, with the staff saying her wheelchair could block other diners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said attitudes towards the disabled had improved over the past decade, but more needs to be done.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can there be more training for staff to improve awareness? Not just for wheelchair users, but restaurants may also think of how to help those who are visually impaired," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that there may be difficulties - especially for small shops in Hong Kong - but we can work together. For example, some small restaurants have ramps for people with disabilities or wheelchair users."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said the incident was not common, but it showed that some restaurants may not be familiar with the city's anti-discrimination legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most restaurants have training for their staff, but some small-scale ones may have overlooked [this] during the training process. We hope the catering sector and the government could do more promotion," he told the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the Thai restaurant’s manager apologised to her and she accepted the apology.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday announced it had cut its base rate by 25 basis points to five percent with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The base rate is the benchmark for repo transactions under the discount window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said it cut the rate in response to an overnight cut in the US federal funds rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and the Bank of China said they would cut their best lending rates by a quarter of percentage point to 5.375 percent from Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, the US Federal Reserve announced a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point after policy-makers voted unanimously to lower the rate to between 4.50 and 4.75 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the HKMA said the pace of Fed rate cuts was still uncertain, posing a risk to global financial market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rate-cut cycle in the US is still at its initial stage. Interest rates might still remain at relatively high levels for some time. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," the authority said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Hong Kong dollar peg mechanism, interest rates move in lockstep with the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said Donald Trump's proposed economic policies might affect the Fed's moves to tamp down inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan includes tax cuts, tariffs and a mass deportation of illegal immigrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once Trump really starts to take office and begins to roll out his policies, that's the time when the market will begin to be more concerned with what will happen to the economy," Lau told an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will need at least three, six months before that will all come through. Of course, the worry is that rates might have to reverse course and go higher because of the worry about inflation, but that's more for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, meanwhile, said local housing prices may hit bottom by the end of this year, as the Fed continues its rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now with the rates gradually being lowered, we are expecting the market purchasing power to go up a little bit and to be unleashed gradually. I think the property prices would find bottom in the fourth quarter in 2024," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market sentiment for 2025 must be better than 2024 in order to support a rebound," Wong added.

    Trump names his White House chief of staff

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles, the de-facto manager of his victorious campaign, as his White House chief of staff, the first woman to hold the influential role.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wiles is widely credited within and outside Trump’s inner circle for running what was, by far, his most disciplined and well-executed campaign, and was seen as the leading contender for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  She largely avoided the spotlight, even refusing to take the mic to speak as Trump celebrated his victory early Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  She resisted the formal title of campaign manager, avoiding becoming a target, given Trump’s history of cycling through people in that role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles’ hire is Trump’s first major decision as president-elect and one that could be a defining test of his incoming administration, as he must quickly build the team that will help run the massive federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiles doesn’t bring much federal government experience to the role, but has a close relationship with the president-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign, Wiles was able to do what few others have been able to: help control Trump’s impulses — not by chiding him or lecturing, but by earning his respect and showing him that he was better off when he followed her advice than flouting it. (AP)

 President Xi Jinping will travel to Peru and Brazil next week for meetings of Apec and the G20, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will go to Lima from November 13 to 17 and Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Peru, Xi will "attend the 31st Apec Economic Leaders' Meeting and pay a state visit", Hua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will then travel to Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21 to attend the 19th G20 Summit and will pay a state visit to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Hua added.

  China is Brazil's top trading partner, exceeding US$180 billion in each-way trade in 2023, with semiconductors, phones and pharmaceuticals dominating exports to the South American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A visit this year by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin was seen as paving the way for Brazil to join China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of South American nations, including Peru, have already signed up to the initiative. (AFP/Agencies)

    F1 takes on FIA chief in open letter amid swearing row

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One drivers on Thursday blasted the "tone and language" used by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem amid a row over swearing at press conferences.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an open letter, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) also demanded that competitors be treated like adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several drivers, including three-time world champion Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Monaco's Charles Leclerc, were recently sanctioned by the FIA for swearing at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Ben Sulayem has spoken out in favour of measures to ensure drivers no longer use foul language.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the GPDA hit back with a letter posted on social media regarding 'Driver Misconduct'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as an F1 car, or a driving situation," the letter read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the FIA president to consider his own tone and language when talking to our member drivers, or indeed about them, whether in a public forum or otherwise," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, our members are adults," it went on to say. "They do not need to be given instructions via the media, about matters as trivial as the wearing of jewellery or underpants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has clashed with FIA bosses for wearing jewellery at races, with the governing body also reminding drivers of the need to wear flame-resistant underwear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GPDA also stressed its opposition to financial sanctions against drivers and called on Ben Sulayem to clarify how they are imposed and how their proceeds are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Ben Sulayem, team bosses and drivers have deteriorated in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FIA president was accused at the start of the year of trying to derail the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix and influence the results of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In both cases, the Emirati was cleared by the FIA Ethics Committee. (AFP)

    World number two Swiatek crashes out of WTA Finals

<img alt="The world number two needed a victory from Gauff to advance to the last four. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778086_1_20241108080912.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the WTA Finals on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova defeated Coco Gauff to secure her spot in the semi-finals at the expense of the Pole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Wimbledon champion claimed a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Gauff to end the title defence of Swiatek, who needed Krejcikova to lose in order to progress from the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one win and one loss under her belt entering the last day of round-robin play, Swiatek's 6-1, 6-0 victory over alternate Daria Kasatkina did not have any bearing on her qualification chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only scenario that would have led to Swiatek's advancement to the semi-finals would have been a Gauff win over Krejcikova.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result did not materialise though, and Krejcikova punched her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals for the first time – on her second singles appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova moves forward as the winner of the Orange Group, and will face Zheng Qinwen in Friday's last-four stage, with Gauff of the United States advancing as the runner-up to set up a semi-final showdown with world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Definitely this is a big win for me. I'm really happy with how I played and with my performance today. It was a really big match," said Krejcikova, who saved a remarkable 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Playing tomorrow again is something unimaginable before this tournament and I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just fighting for every ball, and I knew it's going to be difficult because I know Coco is on a roll and she's one of the best players this season," she added. "That was a huge challenge but also the big prize, the semis was on the table – I am super excited to be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff saved two match points in a 10-minute final game and had three opportunities to break Krejcikova but the eighth seed would not fold, and she scooped the victory with a service winner after one hour and 42 minutes of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova, who has won just 21 matches this season, earned her place in the WTA Finals field due to a new rule introduced by the Tour in 2024, which gives priority to a reigning Grand Slam champion over the eighth-ranked player in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova grabbed the last spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro, who chose not to come to Saudi Arabia as an alternate. (AFP)

    Mbappé left out of France squad for internationals

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé has been left out of the France squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches against Israel and Italy, with coach Didier Deschamps insisting the absence of the Real Madrid superstar "is for the best".
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the second successive France squad from which the national team captain has been absent after he also missed the October double-header against Israel and Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have spoken with him and I have made the decision for this get-together because I think it is for the best," Deschamps told reporters at a press conference in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé was rested for last month's matches in order to help him recover from a minor thigh injury suffered playing for Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that quickly became a source of controversy when he returned to action for Real days later, before France had even played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé was absent for France's 4-1 win over Israel in a game played in Budapest and a 2-1 win in Belgium, and instead travelled to Stockholm for a short break with members of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was following that trip that Swedish media reported he was being investigated for an alleged rape. Mbappé himself said those reports were "fake news", while his lawyer said the player would take action for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Swedish prosecutor confirmed that an investigation had been opened, without naming Mbappe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not going to set out my argument, but I can say two things. The first is that Kylian wanted to come," Deschamps added. "The second is that it is not to do with the off-field problems because the presumption of innocence exists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last month's controversy, the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward has made four appearances for his club, scoring one goal. However, he remains short of his explosive best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to say any more about it. I stand by my decision," Deschamps added.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are second in Group A2 of the Nations League, one point behind leaders Italy, ahead of their final two fixtures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They host Israel at the Stade de France next Thursday, November 14, and then play Italy in Milan three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are five points clear of Belgium in third place and the top two teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, which will take place over two legs next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will be played next June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran midfielder N'Golo Kante, of Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, returns to the squad along with Adrien Rabiot of Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there is a first call-up for highly-rated Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who takes the place of West Ham United's Alphonse Areola in the squad. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden pledged a peaceful transfer of power Thursday after Donald Trump's stunning US election win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, 81, urged Americans in a solemn televised address to "bring down the temperature," in stark contrast to Trump's refusal to accept his 2020 election defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump began to work at his Florida resort on his transition team, Biden said he would work for an "orderly" transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech from the Rose Garden of the White House, he called for unity while urging Democrats not to lose hope, saying: "Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated."

  Yet finger-pointing has already erupted in the party over Biden's initial decision to run for a second term despite his age, before dropping out at the last minute in July and handing the reins to Harris, his vice president.

  <br>
  The White House denied Biden had any regrets. "He believed it was the right decision to make at that time," Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. (AFP)

 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq powered to fresh records on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, extending a buoyant post-election rally.
 <br>
  <br>
  While the Dow finished essentially flat, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped to new all-time highs, with large tech companies like Facebook parent Meta and Apple surging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51 percent, to 19,269. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely unchanged at 43,729, but the S&P 500 gained 0.74 percent, to 5,973.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed shrugged off concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's election victory and moved ahead with a quarter point interest rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, noting there was still uncertainty about what President-elect Trump's actual economic agenda would be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices had earlier hit all-time highs on Wednesday as markets greeted Trump's election win in anticipation that tax cuts and the de-regulation would offset the impact of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were cheered by Powell's tone, which kept the door open to further interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, there's going to be a debate about the pace of rate cuts, but policy makers and chair Powell mentioned that they continue to think that policy is restrictive," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.

  <br>
  While tech shares advanced, banking shares pulled back after a torrid session on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped 1.4 percent, while JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3 percent. (AFP)
