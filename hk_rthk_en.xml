<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<img alt="Sources say the fixed accident and emergency fee will be raised to no more than HK$400 from the current HK$180, with exemptions for critically ill and urgent patients. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797197_1_20250324194549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say new fees for public hospital services will be rolled out in three phases starting as early as January next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fee at the accident and emergency unit will be raised from the current HK$180 to no more than HK$400, with exemptions for patients who need urgent care or are critically ill.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's expected that higher A&E charges will allocate more resources to treat the critically ill and reduce the number of non-urgent cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials hope the new fee system will be in place in five years, with reviews every two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources added that there will be a cap on inpatient and outpatient fees, likely set at HK$10,000 per person per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall funding rate for public healthcare will be maintained at 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reform aims to enhance patient protection, optimise the medical fee waiver mechanism to provide assistance to needy patients, and strengthen support for critical illness medications and equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources also said the Samaritan Fund could be relaxing its application requirements so middle-class patients facing severe illness who cannot afford expensive treatment costs could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau is set to announce the details on Tuesday.

    Billiard, tennis retain Tier A status

<img alt="Sports minister Rosanna Law says changes were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths to stay in the elite sports training system. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324184243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary for culture, sports and tourism has called on the ticketing platform Cityline to explain misprints on Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the platform's website, the inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law pointed out that the platform has to apologise over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cityline must explain why it went wrong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's the platform that is in charge of receiving the instructions on how to print the tickets, what tickets were to be printed, as well as the matching afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, they have to explain it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that once the government learnt of the incident, it requested the platform make clear remedial and ticket-exchange arrangements swiftly to those who are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said Cityline and organisers need to have a contingency plan in place in the event that ticket holders do not manage to exchange the misprinted tickets in time for the concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will closely monitor the situation and make requests and provide guidance when necessary, she added.

    Thai PM set to survive no-confidence vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Monday faced a no-confidence motion in parliament as the opposition alleged she was being unduly influenced by her father, a former prime minister, and is mismanaging the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country’s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong is the leader of the People’s Party , a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home .
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn was also accused by Prawit Wongsuwan, head of the Palang Pracharath Party, Pheu Thai’s former coalition partner, of falsely declaring her assets, which she denied. (AP)

    Health officials to help pharmas register new drugs

<img alt="Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan, centre, hopes the new arrangements can speed up the registration of new drugs in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797180_1_20250324172745.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pharmaceutical firms wishing to register new drugs in Hong Kong will soon be able to consult health officials before filing an actual application, saving both sides time and effort.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since November 2023, the Department of Health has made it easier for new drugs to be registered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Called the "1+" mechanism, pharmaceutical products would only need a single registration issued by an existing reference drug regulatory authority, down from two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initially open to drugs used to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, the rule was further extended last year to all new drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven new drugs have so far been registered under the regime, five of which have already been added to the Hospital Authority's formulary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that as of mid-March, it has received 400 enquiries from more than 110 pharmaceutical companies on drug registration matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  To better help the industry understand the regulatory requirements, it will launch a consultation service starting with an online briefing seminar next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan noted that some overseas or mainland firms are not familiar with the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not quite sure or quite understand our registration requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once they got the information, they may discuss with their company to see whether they want to go ahead with the applications...  so that we [don't have] to go back and forth to ask them to provide the supplementary information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will enhance our efficiency for the approval of the application," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department is planning to hold workshops in June and meet potential applicants face to face later in the year to further expedite the process.

    Heathrow 'had enough power to stay open on Friday'

<img alt="The National Grid's boss, John Pettigrew, says either of the two other substations could have supplied the power to keep Heathrow open on Friday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797178_1_20250324172618.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the UK's national grid has said there was "enough power" to keep Heathrow Airport running on Friday, after an electrical substation fire shuttered Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown, which lasted most of the day, affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised questions about the reliability of one of the UK's key pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the Financial Times on Sunday that power had remained available to the airport in west London through two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no lack of capacity from the substations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Losing a substation is a unique event – but there were two others available."
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport officials said the closure was due to the time it took to switch to the other substations and make safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted," a Heathrow Airport official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed so power supplies could be restructured from the two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials have said the blaze, which broke out on Thursday night, was "believed to be non-suspicious" and that enquiries would "focus on the electrical distribution equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Monday about the way airport bosses handled the events, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: "I'm not going to justify decisions that Heathrow leadership did or didn't take."  (AFP)

  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.24 percent to end at 8,850.69, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.72 percent to end at 5,736.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equity markets were mixed as worries about fresh US tariffs pencilled in for next week were tempered by a report that Donald Trump was considering a more targeted approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has caused ructions on trading floors since resuming power in January by hitting out at long-standing allies and imposing or threatening swingeing tariffs on imports of an array of goods, including steel and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next Wednesday is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of reciprocal measures to counter those in other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anticipation and pre-positioning ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' on April 2 and the impending deluge of tariff-related announcements that will follow in the days/weeks after will be a growing factor that drives price action, sentiment and liquidity in markets this week," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the sky begins to bruise and darken, and the atmospheric pressure builds within the capital markets, market players question if it's time to batten down the hatches in preparation for a storm of uncertainty set to be unleashed on markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve last week warned that "uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased" while the central banks of Japan and Britain also warned about the impact of the White House's policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang said at the weekend that Beijing was readying for "shocks that exceed expectations" ahead of the latest measures, adding that "instability and uncertainty are on the upswing."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as he met heads of some of the world's biggest companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, FedEx and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was some hope among investors amid reports the US administration was considering a more targeted approach to the tariffs, with some countries being hit harder than others, and the measures not being as severe as initially feared.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after the president said on Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asian markets fluctuated through the day, with Tokyo falling along with Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai and Wellington joined Hong Kong in edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt opened on the front foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold held around US$3,025, having hit a series of records last week to a peak of more than $3,057 owing to a surge in demand for safe havens. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Monday said it will implement a more proactive fiscal policy this year, with finance minister Lan Fo'an saying the nation's economic and fiscal strengths have grown significantly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the last day of the China Development Forum 2025, Lan said China has gained more experience in macroeconomic management and fiscal governance, and that confidence in the nation's economic development stems from solid fundamentals, numerous advantages, resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Lan said the primary task of this year's fiscal policy is to significantly boost consumption and enhance investment efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has the world's most promising super-sized market, with immense potential for consumption growth," Lan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to global business leaders attending the forum, Lan also emphasised that China will ensure equal treatment for all types of businesses and continue to improve the business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, senior executives of multinational giants attending the forum have highlighted the importance of strengthening global cooperation to ensure that industrial and supply chains can withstand unexpected external shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives told broadcaster CCTV that this meant that they have to come together across borders and industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide Corporation noted there is a tremendous supply chain for the elevator industry on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is our largest manufacturing location anywhere in the world. And so we take advantage of the supply chain here not just for China in China, but also in China for the world," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entrepreneurs, government officials, experts and business representatives from China and around the world attended the two-day forum – themed "Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global Economy".

<img alt="Different plans for temporary ceasefires in the Ukraine war have been proposed, but attacks have continued unabated. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797165_1_20250324162833.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials opened talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday on a partial ceasefire in the Ukraine war, a day after delegates from Washington and Kyiv had their own discussions.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and hopes talks in Riyadh could pave the way for a breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides have proposed different plans for temporary ceasefires, but cross-border attacks have meanwhile continued unabated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally planned to take place simultaneously to enable shuttle diplomacy – with the United States going back and forth between the delegations – the talks are now taking place one after the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting between the Ukrainian team, led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, and the Americans finished up late on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy," Umerov said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a "just and lasting peace" a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way for a "full-on" ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire," he told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are only at the beginning of this path," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there were many outstanding questions over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities said on Monday they would deploy dozens of helicopters and thousands of firefighters and soldiers as they struggle to control multiple wildfires in the southeast, which have been burning for days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been killed so far, with officials warning that high winds and rising temperatures were hindering efforts to put out the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Uiseong, nearly 7,000 hectares of land has been affected and around 600 people evacuated, said Lim Sang-seop, head of the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 57 wildfire fighting helicopters are to be deployed to extinguish the fire," he said, adding that more than 2,600 fire fighting personnel – including soldiers – would be mobilised "to respond with all their might."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire had been partly contained but was still burning as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in multiple locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A major wildfire claimed four lives over the weekend in Sancheong county, in South Gyeongsang province, about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire was also partly contained by Monday – but still burning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, citing "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated as acting president on Monday, visited the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, urging authorities to work together "until the wildfires are completely extinguished."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a truly heartbreaking incident," he said, adding that he would meet people affected by the fires later on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, urged authorities to "mobilise all means at their disposal to quickly and safely suppress the fires" and take further measures to prevent any additional wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other phenomena such as forest fires, droughts, snowstorms and tropical storms can result from a combination of complex factors. (AFP)

 China has not received any application for asylum from Philippines' former President Rodrigo Duterte and his family, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday.

  Duterte's trip to Hong Kong was for his personal holidays, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press conference.

  The former president was arrested on March 11 at Manila's main airport on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of its probe into a "war on drugs" that defined his presidency. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildfires have hit several regions in western Japan, injuring at least two people, forcing dozens of residents to evacuate and damaging a number of homes as hundreds of firefighters battled the widening blazes in the mountainous areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires in the western towns of Okayama, Imabari and Aso broke out on Sunday, quickly burning hundreds of hectares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six homes have been damaged in city of Okayama, where a fire started on Mount Kaigara and burned 250 hectares of the forest. In Imabari, in the Ehime prefecture on the main island of Shikoku, the fire left a firefighter slightly injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters and defense helicopters sprayed water but the blazes in the two prefectures had not been extinguished as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts blamed dry weather and dried-up fallen leaves on the ground in the forest as likely causes of the wildfires in Okayama and Imabari.
  <br>
  <br>
  A smaller fire was detected in the mountainous village of Aso in the Kumamoto prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu on Sunday, but it was extinguished early on Monday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. One person was injured slightly. Local media said the fire started while residents were burning trash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fires came just weeks after extensive wildfires in the northern Japanese city of Ofunato left one person dead and damaged more than 200 houses and other buildings as the blaze burned 2,900 hectares, nearly one tenth of the land in the city. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)

    Appeal crunch time for Blatter and Platini

<img alt="Michael Platini, left, with Sepp Blatter in 2014. File Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797152_1_20250324151246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and France football great Michel Platini will appear before a Swiss court on Tuesday to hear whether the case that finished their careers in football will end with their acquittals or convictions for corruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, once among the most powerful figures in global football, will appear at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court two-and-a-half years after they were acquitted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiss federal prosecutors rejected the decision at a lower court from 2022, leading to the new hearing in the town of Muttenz, near Basel. Both men deny the charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case relates to a two million Swiss franc payment Blatter authorised for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, which was made in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini and Blatter said the payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because Fifa lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The affair, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer body Uefa, torpedoed his hopes of eventually succeeding Blatter at the top of Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini were suspended from football in 2015 by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years. Although their exclusions were later reduced, the ban ended their careers as senior football administrators. The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world soccer's ruling body to pay Platini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work. This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties," the indictment said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment was credible, while there were serious doubts about the prosecution's allegation the payment was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years until 2015, has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Now a frail 89-year-old, he said he was the victim of a witch-hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, a three-times European Footballer of the Year, insisted the money was related to backpay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no corruption, there's no swindling, there's nothing at all," he said at the start of the appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Dominic Nellen said the case was designed to stop Platini becoming Fifa president.

  <br>
  "Platini was the most likely successor to Blatter in 2015, but someone wanted him out of the way," Nellen said. "At every turn there seems to be an attempt to stop Platini becoming president of Fifa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter was eventually replaced by Gianni Infantino, who had worked for Platini at Uefa. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, Platini, was banned from football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino has denied helping to bring about Platini's downfall, and said he only stepped up when Uefa asked him after the allegations against Platini emerged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors want a sentence of 20 months in jail, suspended for two years for both Blatter and Platini, and to confiscate the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides can appeal against the judgement to the Swiss Federal Court, the country's highest legal authority. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela on Monday received nearly 200 citizens deported from the United States via Honduras, as US President Donald Trump cracks down on undocumented foreigners.
 <br>
  <br>
  A plane carrying the deportees touched down early in the day at Maiquetia International Airport outside the capital Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we are receiving 199 compatriots," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live footage showed young men in sweatsuits walking off the plane. Some of them were seen smiling and clapping as officials looked on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes after Venezuela on Saturday announced it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriation flights from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest in a string of repatriations of Venezuelan migrants since US President Donald Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flights are resuming," Cabello said at the airport. "Trips have had little regularity, not because of Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to receive Venezuelans wherever they are," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deportation pipeline was suspended last month when Trump claimed Venezuela had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants, and Caracas subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then Washington deported 238 Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump has designated a foreign terrorist organisation, to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a move deeply criticised by Caracas. (AFP)

    Subsidy level for public healthcare 'unsustainable'

<img alt="Public Doctors' Association chairman Christopher Lung is calling for clear guidelines for frontline medics to handle future fee-related arguments with patients. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797138_2_20250324131612.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's no way Hong Kong's public healthcare system will be sustainable in the long term if the government continues to subsidise nearly all of the expenses, according to an adviser tasked with reforming the body managing the hospitals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is currently reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, with details to be announced by Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franklin Lam, who sits on the Hospital Authority's Governance and Structure Reform Committee, stressed the need for patients to shoulder more of their expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently the government covers more than 97 percent of public healthcare expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every HK$100 spent, the patient only pays around HK$2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the lowest in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, Lam pointed out that Singapore subsidises around 80 percent of healthcare costs for the underprivileged and less for those who earn more.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest budget in Hong Kong, healthcare expenditure for 2025/26 will reach HK$115 billion, a 5.6 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you divide that expenditure by the labour force of 3.8 million, each worker receives around HK$30,000 [in subsidies]," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public health expenditure is also 1.4 times the revenue from salaries' tax," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while fees and charges for public services could go up, he suggested it was "quite likely" there would be a cap for patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, there is annual cap of HK$10,000 for each patient...," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's about 2 percent of median family income.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would people decide not to see a doctor just because they have to spend HK$10,000? I don't think so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association also agreed on the need to adjust public hospital charges and called for understanding from all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the possible adjustments could come from the accident and emergency department, with patients triaged into less urgent categories paying more than the current flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Association chairman Christopher Lung said he hopes authorities can clearly explain the fee schedule to the public, while providing adequate guidelines for medics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Patients are triaged based on objective data such as symptoms and vital signs. But sometimes they are not satisfied and get into confrontations with frontline medics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lung also suggested the new fee levels align with those in the private sector so as to ease the strain on public hospitals.

    Govt to exceed family office target: treasury chief

<img alt="Christopher Hui says about one fourth of the new family offices had set up shop in the SAR partly due to the 'Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit.' Photo: Courtesy of Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797135_1_20250324130303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Monday he is confident that the government will be able to beat the target of bringing in over 200 large family offices by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The goal was set by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address in 2022 as part of measures to cement the city's status as a global wealth management hub by attracting investment and capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with a local newspaper, Hui noted that the government's investment promotion arm, InvestHK, has already assisted more than 160 family offices in setting up shop or expanding in the SAR and that another 150 are planning to follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While over 80 percent of the new family offices are from across the Taiwan Strait, others are from the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Americas and Oceania, he added, noting that the total number of new family offices could be much higher than the government data as some might have set up shop via other agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also noted that the authorities plan to turn the upcoming "Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit" into an annual flagship event as one fourth of the family offices that had set up here had done so partly due to the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third edition of the event is set to take place on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, more than 2,700 single family offices have chosen Hong Kong as their base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Hui noted that there are opportunities for growth in the city's family office business as global investors might "prioritise stability" amid the uncertain policy environment in the United States. He said the city provides a stable, sustainable and predictable business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government has introduced a bill to the Legislative Council to set up a "company relocation mechanism" to assist businesses in their relocations and that the legislative process of the bill could be completed in the first half.

    'Public flat tenants will have ample time to move out'

<img alt="The Housing Authority's Cleresa Wong expects at least a few hundred flats could be released after rules are tightened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797127_1_20250324121128.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority on Monday said well-off public housing tenants will be given sufficient time to move out of their flats once rules are tightened.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the new rules, some tenants will be required to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the standard rent starting from October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, if a tenant's income is between four to five times the limit after two declaration cycles, they will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairperson of the authority’s subsidised housing committee Cleresa Wong said she expects at least a few hundred flats to be released after the rules are tightened, but she offered assurances that tenants will not be forced to move out immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenants will only have to move out after they surrender their public flat and get another property," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't have to worry about moving and residing elsewhere temporarily, before being able to purchase a flat under the 'white form' status or a first-hand private housing unit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Lo Wai-kwok, who is also a member of the committee, said well-off public housing tenants would be able to afford the higher rents, adding that new policies can also encourage them to buy a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residential prices in the private market have gradually stabilised, and we have policies like the Home Ownership Scheme, and the 'green form' status. More tenants who can afford [it] may consider purchasing a flat," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estates Man Yu-ming, meanwhile, said it may be hard for some tenants to pay more rent, but he believes the changes could encourage upward mobility.

    Coldplay ticket fixes 'could be dealt with by post'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker suggested on Monday that the ticketing platform Cityline deal with exchanges necessitated by printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets by post.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets, according to Cityline's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of the seven ticket-exchange locations in Hong Kong, the platform has also added similar facilities in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  All booths will run from today until April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Yang Wing-kit noted that the two booths on the mainland are insufficient even though they are better than nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be people coming from the mainland, or even Southeast Asia to see the concerts. If you only set up booths in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, maybe people in Shanghai will have to spend a lot of time travelling to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to exchange their tickets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will be an inconvenience. Couldn't we come up with other ways, such as mailing the tickets by post? That would be much more convenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Cityline should come up with ways to compensate those who are affected, such as by waiving the handling fee and offering priority bookings in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exchanges could only be carried out in the SAR, before Cityline announced late on Saturday that booths would also be set up on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aryan Sethi, a local ticket holder, was among those who headed to the Tsim Sha Tsui booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was satisfied with the exchange arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've given us until April 7, which is at least one day before the show I booked for, so I think it's ok," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy they informed us as early as they could, instead of at least one week before, so I think it was ok."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people, meanwhile, told RTHK that they only found out about the ticketing error on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because they either did not get the email or only found it in the spam folder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will play at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 11am on Sunday, the Consumer Council has received 25 complaints over the incident.

    Local art space takes Art Basel on vampire adventure

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Want to see vampires travelling through time and space? Local art space Para Site is turning Art Basel's film section into a sci-fi wonderland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from tradition, the SAR’s premier art show has handed over its film programming reins to Para Site – marking the first time an organisation will be in charge of curating the section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're almost thinking of this programme like a film festival," said Para Site's executive director Billy Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's something about that gesture that is very collective and collaborative. So we really wanted to use that to mark the difference of our approach as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and three others curated the film programme themed "In Space, It's Always Night", which includes feature films, videos and moving images by 30 artists from around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centrepiece is "Vampires in Space" by Portuguese filmmaker Isadora Neves Marques, which tells the story of a family of vampires travelling through the cosmos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang told RTHK that he wants to bring new perspectives and create dialogue between local and international artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For an outsider, maybe people think a lot about Wong Kar-wai, and it's such a powerful legacy and becomes synonymous with the city," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we chose Isadora's film, we thought long and hard about that as well, because I think they represent a potential of something that could potentially in the future speak a lot about Hong Kong issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the videos in the programme titled "The Pixelated You" also features works by six Hong Kong-based artists, exploring the act of imagining others through imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the project aims to support the local art ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to think within the visibility of the art fair, how to channel that to focus on different communities that represent the city, how also it can draw attention to the wider city as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art enthusiasts can experience these otherworldly screenings at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from March 27 to 30.

    HK strives to attain carbon neutrality: Tse Chin-wan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan said on Monday that Hong Kong will continue to strive for carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the SAR’s multi-pronged plan to achieve this goal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a climate forum organised by the Environment and Ecology Bureau and University of Hong Kong, the minister said the city's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality have been bearing fruit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the building of coal-fired power plants in 1997 and have been gradually shifting to natural gas and nuclear power. Due to the efforts made, Hong Kong reached the carbon peak in 2014. Comparing to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about 30 percent of that of the United States and 60 percent of that of the European Union," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, the government announced its Climate Action Plan 2050 which outlined measures for the SAR to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  It consists of four major decarbonisation strategies, such as net zero electricity generation, green transport and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a new facility will be built to increase the proportion of zero carbon electricity to around 70 percent by 2035, along with an upgrade for the current cross-border electricity transmission infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  On transport, he said the government is expanding the city's electric vehicle charging network, and will stop selling private cars that run on gasoline or diesel by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong will stop using landfills to handle municipal waste by the same year to cut the eight percent carbon emission from waste disposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment minister also said Hong Kong’s first waste-to-energy incinerator facility will start operations by the end of the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy striker Moise Kean admitted his team "got distracted" after Germany's Jamal Musiala scored an easy goal into an empty net when absent-minded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his post during the Nations League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany saw off Italy 5-4 on aggregate following a 3-3 second-leg draw to reach the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich, who scored the first goal for Germany, played a key role in the bizarre second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kimmich, seeing the Italian keeper had drifted off his line, took a quickly-taken corner that was flicked into the empty net by Musiala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got distracted. It can happen to concede goals like that. We'll work better on it next time," said Kean who scored twice in the second half as Italy rallied from a 3-0 interval deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said the quick thinking was "world-class and unbelievably smart," and admitted "I didn't see it at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  One person who did see it was 15-year-old ballboy Noel Urbaniak who noticed that Donnarumma wasn't paying attention and quickly threw the ball to Kimmich.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very sharp, which isn't bad in a game like this, he did well," said Kimmich who autographed and presented a match ball to the teenager after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He'll get a free ticket to the next home game," promised German football federation Rudi Voller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never been a ballboy before, this is my first time, and it feels really good," Urbaniak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy coach Luciano Spalletti blasted his team's lack of maturity over the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that they take corners quickly and must not turn our backs," said Spalletti. (AFP)

<img alt="Xia Baolong met EuroCham chair Inaki Amate and business representatives in Beijing last week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Monday welcomed last week's remarks from the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, who praised EuroCham's work in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong told a visiting EuroCham delegation to Beijing that Hong Kong had the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , EuroCham chairman Inaki Amate said the most important takeaway from the meeting was the central government's commitment to the long-term stability and prosperity of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had an opportunity to express our commitment to the Hong Kong SAR and to the measures that the Hong Kong and Chinese government are putting forward to ensure the long term stability that we need in the business community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amate also said the European Chamber of Commerce was working hard to encourage companies from Europe to set up operations in the city and contribute to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [firms] see that the potential of Hong Kong has not vanished. That there is still a lot that Hong Kong can offer to international firms in the way they can penetrate back into China but also can consider Hong Kong as a regional headquarters."

    Stocks open up amid caution over tariffs

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index opened 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, up at 23,749. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797110_1_20250324110326.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index climbed 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, to open at 23,749.58 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as financial markets made a mixed start with US stock futures rising but the dollar wavering ahead of a week driven by data, Chinese earnings and the threat of steep US tariff hikes on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures were up about 0.6 percent in the morning and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei climbed about 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The week holds global purchasing managers index gauges, the US Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading, inflation data in Australia and Japan, a budget update in Britain and major earnings in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is likely to be updates on US President Donald Trump's plans to for global reciprocal tariffs from April 2 that drives markets, and after a volatile month for stocks, bonds and currencies, analysts said there is no obvious trade ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to really devise a structural playbook," said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to put your mind into the head of the consumer and households," he said, since it has been fears of a slowdown in the world's biggest economy that has led to weeks of selling dollars and stocks and a strong rally for Treasuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anything that feeds into this higher probability of recession, higher probability of a stagflationary environment ... or that price pressures aren't transitory is where we start to get panicky a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to impose a complicated barrage of tariffs, the details of which are not clear save that they are to be calculated to reflect the impact of foreign tariffs as well as foreign value-added taxes on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong shares are up 18 percent so far this year, the largest gain of any major market, but a drop of 4.4 percent over two sessions late last week pointed to a pause in the flow of money while traders consider their, and Trump's, next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earnings at automaker BYD, video platform Kuaishou as well as Chinese banks and several property developers will be in focus. In the United States, discount retailer Dollar Tree and up-market athletic clothier Lululemon are on the calendar.

<img alt="Mirra Andreeva receives treatment from a WTA physiotherapist during an injury timeout in her Miami Open match against Amanda Anisimova at Hard Rock Stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva, coming off back-to-back WTA 1000 wins in Dubai and Indian Wells, exited in the third round, her 13-match winning streak ending with a three-sets loss to American Amanda Anisimova.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, the 11th seed, hoped to continue her rise up the rankings with a strong showing in Miami but appeared to be hampered by injury as she lost to 17th seeded Miami resident Anisimova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva received lengthy medical attention in her abdominal area when 2-1 down in the first set, which she lost 7-6 (7/5).
  <br>
  <br>
  She bounced back, dominating the second set 6-2 but Anisimova won the third set of the two hour and 49-minute battle 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anisimova will face Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, after the British player advanced when her American opponent McCartney Kessler retired injured in the second set of their encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year," said Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone," said Dimitrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils delighted his supporters defeating Spaniard Jaume Munar 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7/1). (AFP)

    S Korea court dismisses impeachment of prime minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court dismissed the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Monday, reinstating him as acting president – a role he was given after the president was suspended for declaring martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Han's impeachment was dismissed in a 5-1 vote by the court's eight justices. Two justices voted to reject the impeachment motion entirely," Yonhap reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court ruling is the latest development in South Korea's complex and sprawling political crisis, which was touched off by suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled parliament impeached Yoon's replacement Han just weeks after he assumed the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers cited Han's refusal to appoint more judges to the Constitutional Court – which will also decide on Yoon's impeachment – plus his purported role in the martial law debacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court only had six judges at the time, meaning that had even one judge refused to back impeachment, Yoon would have been reinstated. The opposition had called for three more to be appointed, taking the court up to a full bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to local broadcaster YTN, the court decision on Monday "explained that not certifying nominees is illegal, but not enough to warrant dismissal," in its decision to throw out Han's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  YTN also said that the court "found no evidence of [Han's] role" at meetings related to planning the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two additional judges to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who immediately resumed the acting presidency after the ruling, thanked the Constitutional Court for its "wise decision".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere. I think there is no place for division now. Our country's priority is to move forward," he added. (AFP)

    Mark Carney calls snap Canadian election

<img alt="Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the move at a news conference in Ottawa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797074_1_20250324055036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who "wants to break us so America can own us."
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the next election was not due until October 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal Party in the polls since January, when Trump began threatening Canada and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon being sworn in as prime minister on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty," Carney told reporters after the Governor General - the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state - approved his request for an election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carney's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on March 6 delayed a broad 25 percent tariff on some Canadian goods for 30 days. He has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and threatened reciprocal tariffs on additional goods, including Canadian dairy and lumber, on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The polling suggests that the number one concern that Canadians have right now is the potential negative fallout of Donald Trump and the threatened tariffs," said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist and founder of pollster Nanos Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney is "probably setting the groundwork for something a little more strident on April 2nd," Nanos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former two-time central banker with no previous political or election campaign experience, captured the Liberal leadership two weeks ago by persuading party members he was the best person to tackle Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he has five weeks to win over Canadians. On Sunday, Carney proposed cutting the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point.

  <br>
  Polls suggest the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015 and badly trailed the official opposition Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We moved from an election where people wanted change to an election that's really much more about leadership," said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ability of the Conservatives to attack the Liberals has been greatly diminished, because people are focused on the here and now and the near-term future, not on what happened over the last 10 years," he said by phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conservatives have sought to portray Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. They also accuse him of being less than clear about how he transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney bristled last week when asked about the trust, and accused the reporter asking of engaging in "conflict and ill will". The prickly reaction could give hope to the Conservatives that Carney might stumble during what will be his first campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any victory will be a good performance in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. Carney had trouble at one press conference when asked to respond in French, first misunderstanding the question and then answering in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, speaks flawless French and is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need to do is put Canada first for a change," Poilievre said at a press conference on Sunday to launch his campaign, adding that his policies, including tax cuts and increased resource production, would bring back investment, helping Canada become more self-reliant and better equipped to stand up to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Western University in the Canadian city of London, said Carney's inexperience might not be that important given the Trump factor. "I have a feeling we're going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released last week put the Liberals on 42 percent public support and the Conservatives on 37 percent. Angus Reid said the margin of error was around 1.5 percent, 19 times out of 20. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leader Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a balanced scoring performance in a 120-91 victory at Utah.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jarrett Allen scored 18 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16 to lead six Cavaliers in double figures while Evan Mobley added 11 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a long season. We're going to go through some ups and downs, we're not going to play our best," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this streak had happened in November I don't think everybody would be tripping as much. This is all part of the season. It's all part of getting better. Won tonight. We've turned the corner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs, with the NBA's second-best record, improved to 57-14 after prior road trip losses at the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Phoenix, while the Jazz, with the NBA's second-worst record, fell to 16-56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland stretched the lead atop the East to five and a half games over defending NBA champion Boston but remain one and a half games behind Oklahoma City (58-12) for the NBA's best overall record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-0 run to open the second half lifted the Cavs ahead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got some stops and then got in transition and made some shots. That helped," Mitchell said. "This is a great win. Now we're got to continue to take care of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Filipowski led Utah with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Detroit, rookie forward Ronald Holland scored 26 points off the bench to lead the Pistons over visiting New Orleans 136-130.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Duren added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, which improved to 40-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons are two wins from their first winning season since 2016 as they seek a first playoff berth since 2019 and first playoff win since 2008.

<img alt="Mikel Oiarzabal opened the scoring for Spain in their second leg clash against the Netherlands. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797081_2_20250324074010.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Goalkeeper Mike Maignan saved twice in the shoot-out as France beat Croatia 5-4 on penalties after their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate, sealing a place in the last four in June.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus won 2-0 on the night with goals in normal time by Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembele at the Stade de France to wipe out their deficit from Thursday's first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  With no further scoring in extra time the tie went to penalties, where Maignan saved from both Martin Baturina and Josip Stanisic, while Franjo Ivanovic also missed his kick for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez both failed to convert for the hosts, but Dayot Upamecano scored when he became the seventh France player to step up, sparking scenes of celebrations on the pitch and in the crowd of 77,502.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who won the Nations League in 2021, will now take on title-holders Spain in the semi-finals in Germany on June 5, with the winners going through to the final three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile Croatia, who lost on penalties to Spain in the final of the last edition of the Nations League in 2023, will now start their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will go into qualifying Group L with the Czech Republic, Montenegro, the Faroe Islands and Gibraltar.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's progress to the final stages of the Nations League means they will not begin their World Cup qualifying campaign until September, when they will be in Group D with Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Nations League holders Spain reached the final four with a 5-4 win on penalties against the Netherlands, after a thrilling 3-3 quarter-final second leg draw had left the tie 5-5 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donyell Malen missed and Barcelona's Pedri slotted home to settle a gripping match in which the Netherlands came from behind three times to force the shoot-out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Oyarzabal opened the scoring for Spain but Memphis Depay levelled from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed Spain's second before Ian Maatsen rifled home to force extra-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal, who also missed a penalty in the shoot-out, scored a brilliant goal to put Spain ahead but Xavi Simons netted another spot-kick to force penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so nice to wear this shirt and to be able to score this goal," Pedri said, with his side facing France in the semi-finals. "We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Spain's struggles in Rotterdam on Thursday in the 2-2 first-leg draw, coach Luis de la Fuente made a handful of changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal and Dani Olmo came in for Alvaro Morata and Pedri, while Dean Huijsen made his first start, against the country of his birth, and excelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman brought in debutant Maatsen at left-back, giving him the unenviable challenge of shackling 17-year-old prodigy Yamal at Valencia's sold-out Mestalla stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's success in recent years has inspired their supporters and over 20,000 watched them train ahead of the second leg, which also served as a fundraiser for damage caused by the devastating storms which hit the Valencia region last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won a penalty early on when Jan Paul van Hecke clumsily brought down Oyarzabal, who scored the winning goal for La Roja in the Euro 2024 final last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Sociedad forward took it himself, smashing into the bottom right corner, past Bart Verbruggen's dive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal had a goal ruled out for offside and the Brighton goalkeeper denied Nico Williams with a superb stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 19, was jeered by the travelling Dutch fans, upset he did not choose to play for them, but Spain supporters backed him in response and he shone. (AFP)

    Filipino teenager Eala sends Keys packing in Miami

<img alt="Eala is the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since 1975. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797077_1_20250324055913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala, the 2022 U.S. Open girls' singles champion, who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growing up it was tough," Eala said in her on-court interview. "You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think – I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat – and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success," said the American.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break. (AFP)

    Hamas official killed as Gaza death toll passes 50,000

<img alt="Palestinians attend the funeral of Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797059_1_20250323233123.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed a Hamas political leader, Salah al-Bardaweel, on Sunday, the militant group said, as Palestinian officials put the death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict at over 50,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bardaweel was a member of the Hamas decision-making body, the political office, and had held posts such as heading the Hamas delegation for indirect truce talks with Israel in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His blood, that of his wife and martyrs, will remain fuelling the battle of liberation and independence," the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two months of relative calm in the war, Gazans have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions echoed throughout the north, central and southern Gaza Strip early on Sunday, as Israeli planes hit several targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attacks that began earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its initial assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the terms of the January ceasefire agreement by refusing to begin negotiations for an end to the war and a withdrawal of its troops from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying "bridging" proposals from US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. (Reuters)

    Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen wins 1,500m in Nanjing

<img alt="Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen celebrates after winning the men’s 1500m final during the Indoor World Athletics Championships in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797058_1_20250323214422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m in Nanjing on Sunday to claim not only a first global gold in his favoured distance, but also a rare world indoor track distance double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, who had won the 3,000m on Saturday for his first world indoor title, clocked 3min 38.79sec to emulate the double claimed by Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie in Maebashi in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Neil Gourley took silver in 3:39.07 while American Luke Houser rounded out the podium (3:39.17).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is something special," said Ingebrigtsen, before adding: "A lot of things have changed and I'm not doing this because anyone else has done it before. So that's purely a coincidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to compare yourself against history and what others are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm only focusing on myself and I feel good to have done a lot of preparations, and that was always the main goal. It's not to do with something somebody else did before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I can do more, so I'll try to maximise that and grab the opportunity given to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen's victory also banished some of the Norwegian's 1,500m demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main goal is obviously to win both distances, but I would say so far a pretty good indoor season, getting out and succeeding with the things that I wanted to accomplish, so it's been good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, as his wont, was happy to sit at the back of the nine-strong pack as American Samuel Prakel took up the running in Nanjing, splitting the pack into single file.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian moved to the front with four laps to run, Britain's Gourley on his shoulder and Mariano Garcia of Spain also in the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen surged again, shouldering off Austrian veteran Raphael Pallitsch's clumsy attempt at a pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to try their luck was Portugal's Isaac Nader, but at the bell it was Ingebrigtsen in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gourley raced down the inside line of the far straight, but there was to be no Briton to spoil the party at the line, as there has been twice at the world outdoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian kept not only his speed but also his nerve to see off his rivals, crossing the finish line with a brief look over his shoulder and a wagging index finger. (AFP)

    Pope calls for 'immediate' end to Israeli strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis called on Sunday for an "immediate" end to Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip, and for the resumption of dialogue for the release of hostages and a "definitive ceasefire".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am saddened by the resumption of the intense Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, with so many deaths and injuries", Francis wrote in his Angelus prayer, which was published Sunday as the 88-year-old was being discharged from more than five weeks in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask that the weapons be silenced immediately and that the courage be found to resume dialogue so that all the hostages can be freed and a definitive ceasefire reached", said Francis, who was set to return to the Vatican on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is once again very serious and requires the urgent commitment of the conflicting parties and the international community", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Pope Francis greeted and thanked the faithful from a balcony of Rome's Gemelli hospital on Sunday, the first time the 88-year-old has been seen in public since his admission on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, everyone", a weak-sounding Francis said into a microphone, as he sat in a wheelchair waving gently to hundreds of people gathered below, and doing the occasional thumbs-up sign.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Masters champion Patrick Reed qualified for the British Open after coming second behind fellow LIV player Carlos Ortiz at the International Series Macau on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican Ortiz also earned his spot at the major in Portrush, Northern Ireland, in July, after holding off the American for a three-shot victory at the Asian Tour event in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Kokrak also qualified as he finished third at Macau Golf and Country Club, three shots further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was one shot ahead of the 2017 Masters champion and another LIV player in Sergio Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard missed a three-footer for birdie on the last which would have seen him tie with Kokrak and secure a place at the British Open through countback based on his higher world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau tournament was added this year to the Open Qualifying Series for the first time, with the top three players who are not already exempt earning a berth at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  LIV players do not earn world-ranking points, severely restricting their chances of qualifying for golf's four major tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ortiz carded a final-round six-under-par 64 to triumph with a total 22-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, had shared the lead with Ortiz heading into the final round but had to settle for a runner-up finish after carding a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed's best performance at the British Open was 10th in 2019. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ticket sales for the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens are breaking records less than one week before the event kicks off at the Kai Tak Sports Park, according to the event's organiser.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated mega event will take place from March 28 to 30 at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China Rugby said 43,000 tickets have been sold, including 8,000 in the past week alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a capacity of 47,000, that means over 90 percent of all tickets have been snapped up. Only three-day passes remain, with each adult ticket costing HK$1,950.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser expects a total attendance of 138,000 over three days, a new record for the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby said the SAR squad is ready to compete, and is excited to be entering a new era of rugby history with the move away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Hong Kong, China teams have reached great heights both on the world stage and in the neighborhoods across the city. We look forward to together capitalising on the new opportunities presented by Kai Tak for our community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's and women's squads will be competing in the Melrose Claymores, a tournament which runs in parallel to the main Sevens competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's team will be aiming to defend their Melrose title, facing China on Friday and Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the women's team, who finished as runners-up to China last year, will play Kazakhstan on the opening day and Thailand next.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs have arrested an inbound traveller at the airport for allegedly smuggling cannabis buds into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old man arrived at the SAR on Saturday on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was subsequently stopped at customs clearance, when officers said they found around 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in his suitcase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected drugs are worth HK$2.2 million in market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation is still ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs also reminded the public that drug trafficking is a serious offence, and offenders upon conviction face a maximum fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

<img alt="McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix with second placed McLaren's Lando Norris and third placed Mercedes' George Russell. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797037_1_20250323172831.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri led from pole to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren used a one-stop strategy to complete a dominant one-two with Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  George Russell was third in a Mercedes with Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen snatching fourth place after a thrilling late pass on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton came home sixth behind his teammate after his first Ferrari victory in Saturday's sprint race in Shanghai, when Piastri had been second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an incredible weekend, the car has been pretty mega," said the Australian Piastri, who had been running second a week ago in Melbourne' season-opener before a late spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very, very happy. The hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, so to go all the way to the end was a bit of a surprise, but a happy surprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris had to cope with a late brake issue which forced him to settle for second rather than challenge his teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton continues to lead the championship after two race weekends on 44 points from Verstappen on 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell started from second and knew it was imperative to try to grab the lead off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead he was squeezed by Piastri on the long first bend complex, which allowed Norris to surge past into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ferraris got past Verstappen on the same bend, relegating the world champion from fourth to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc lost part of his front wing when it brushed Hamilton's rear right wheel but it did not affect his pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton was the first of the front-runners to dive in for new rubber on lap 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the others followed for hard tyres with Russell getting past Norris in the melee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the McLaren showed superior pace and surged back past at the end of the pit straight with the help of DRS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton began to struggle on the hard compound and allowed his teammate past on lap 21 freeing Leclerc to go after Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 38 Hamilton had to pit again for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front five all stayed out as it became clear they were going to attempt to make the hard tyres last till the end of the 56 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen had nursed his tyres throughout the race which enabled him to have a late charge on Leclerc and pass the Ferrari at the start of lap 54.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haas finished with two cars in the points as Esteban Ocon was seventh and rookie Ollie Bearman 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other points scorers were Mercedes teenager Kimi Antonelli in eighth with Alex Albon ninth in his Williams on his 29th birthday. (AFP)

    Istanbul court formally arrests mayor amid protests

<img alt="Turkish people take to the streets to protest the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul mayor and CHP's presidential race candidate, in Kayseri, Turkey. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797031_1_20250323164214.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Turkish court formally placed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu under arrest as part of a graft investigation on Sunday, after a fourth night of mass protests sparked heavy clashes with riot police.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision was confirmed by one of Imamoglu's lawyers, with the court also due to rule in a second "terror-related" probe into the popular opposition mayor, whose detention has sparked Turkey's worst street protests in over a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No despair! Keep fighting!" wrote the main opposition CHP party on X, denouncing it as "a political coup d'etat".
  <br>
  <br>
  The news came as voters cast their ballots in a CHP primary to name Imamoglu the party's candidate for the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-planned vote was the event which triggered the arrest of Imamoglu, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was detained in connection with two probes alleging graft and "aiding a terror organisation", accusations which he on Saturday told police were "immoral and baseless".
  <br>
  <br>
  The move against him sparked protests in Istanbul that have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, unleashing running battles with police, who arrested 323 people overnight, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls opened at 8:00 am local time with 5,600 ballot boxes in 81 cities. The CHP said the vote was open to everyone, not just members, in the hope of a massive show of support for Imamoglu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite our nation... to the ballot box. We are casting our vote to support President Ekrem: for democracy, justice and the future," said his wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, on X, shortly after voting with her son Selim.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local offices of the ruling AKP party. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang told a gathering of business executives in Beijing on Sunday that China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalisation, practise true multilateralism and strive to be a force for stability and certainty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering the opening address to the China Development Forum, Li called on global executives to capture the opportunities from the country's renewed innovation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum this year saw attendance by prominent business leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that the country would pursue economic globalisation despite "fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have preparations for possible unexpected shocks, which of course mainly come from external sources. Where necessary, the Chinese government will also introduce new policies to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese economy," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump since taking office in January amount to a 20 percent blanket hike on Chinese exports to the United States. Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs on American goods, including on US agricultural goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li underlined Beijing's commitment to opening up the economy and called on global businesses to resist "protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Vice Premier He Lifeng said that China is willing to "engage in candid dialogue" with the United States to resolve issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two countries have "many common interests and broad space for cooperation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Steve Daines on Saturday met with He, during a visit to Beijing viewed as a bid to ease strained relations. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank has begun serving premature or critically-ill newborns across the city, just two months after it came into operation in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's first milk bank, located at the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, has so far recruited more than 100 eligible donors and collected more than 300 litres of milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatrician Rosanna Wong, the milk bank's director, said the numbers were "more than expected".
  <br>
  <br>
  She revealed the bank began distributing donor milk to the city's nine public neonatal intensive care units starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Priority is currently given to babies born under 32 weeks of gestation, or weigh less than 1.5kg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other babies who require the milk will be those who have severe diseases like congenital heart disease, or after a gastrointestinal operation," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong called for additional donations from lactating mothers, saying they could help the bank extend its free service to less premature babies or full-term infants with special needs.

 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has urged more individuals to register as organ donors, as many patients continue to wait for life-saving transplants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony honouring organ donors on Sunday, Lo noted that over 2,600 patients in Hong Kong are currently on the waiting list for organ transplants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while nearly 400,000 people have signed up on the Centralised Organ Donation Register - an all-time high - there still remains considerable potential for growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the number 400,000 is commendable, it still represents less than 6 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population, and less than 10 percent if we consider those over 18 years old. I have always been ambitious. 400,000 is an excellent figure, but history is meant to be broken," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to report an even greater number next year at this gathering, not just a modest increase. I hope we can see a significant rise in organ donation numbers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also highlighted two cross-border organ donation cases from recent years, benefitting a then four-month-old baby girl in 2022, and an eight-month-old infant earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed admiration for families who, even in their saddest moments, turn their loss into a gift for others, describing it as an act of great generosity that helps complete another family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, James Fung, president of the Hong Kong Society of Transplantation, said that in the past two years, there were 54 deceased organ donors who saved 138 patients suffering from organ failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, there were 56 living organ donors, who benefited 56 patients suffering from kidney or liver failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pointed out that there were fewer than 30 deceased organ donors in each of the past two years, making Hong Kong among places in the world with the lowest organ donation rates.

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong will continue to help mainland companies enter international markets. Photo courtesy of Paul Chan's blog" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797020_1_20250323141446.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan pledged his support for Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries, saying they will thrive under the city's unique east-meets-west and inclusive environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who's currently in Beijing, revealed in his weekly article on Sunday that he had visited a leading pop cultural entertainment firm to learn more about the incubation of cultural and creative intellectual property (IP) products.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the enormous potential of the creative industry, saying IP rights holders can ride on the popularity of their products to develop toys, theme parks and even catering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from meeting actual needs of the consumers, these IP products also focus on giving them a joyful experience," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan believed Hong Kong remains the ideal location for mainland companies looking to expand abroad, citing the city's advantages in sourcing capital, abundance of talent and professional services, and free flow of information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Developing IP and extending it to different industries, this creates tremendous value. The mainland has a very rich culture, and is highly creative. Hong Kong can be a platform, and help mainland companies go global. We are very willing to do that," he told the company in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's creative industry workers, he added, not only understand the mainland market, but also possess global vision and are able to create content which resonates with the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing his latest budget, the finance chief said the SAR government will support over 30 cultural IP projects in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, meanwhile, will expand the scope of its target companies to bring in more creative firms that integrate innovation and technology, he said.

 The head of the Science Park called for a balanced approach in technological development, saying while research and development is important, the results must also be applied in practical and real-world settings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong noted the SAR's strong fundamental research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the park is committed to helping startups and enterprises transform their technology into marketable products.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Wong's estimates, Hong Kong is home to over 4,700 innovation and technology companies, employing 40,000 to 50,000 people. He says those numbers still pale in comparison to cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Wong said the SAR needs to focus on attracting more tech firms to set up shop here, noting the ongoing development of two tech projects in the Northern Metropolis - the San Tin Technopole and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also talked about how the Science Park has been helping startups gain exposure overseas. Dozens of tech firms were given a chance to showcase their products at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, as well as the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also send companies to other parts of the world. But US Silicon Valley is important because it is a mecca of entrepreneurship and startup. There's a lot to learn about early stage investment, about entrepreneurship, about product market fit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Startups with great potential even have the chance to undergo six months of training in Silicon Valley through a booster programme. Five firms were earmarked last year, and secured over US$15 million of investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These five companies that went there last year, it was very, very useful. They have to survive and they did survive. That is why we're going to send another 10 companies there this year," Wong said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tennis star Coleman Wong pulled off the biggest triumph of his career in dramatic fashion, defeating 13th seed Ben Shelton of the United States at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old wildcard prevailed 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 in a thrilling three setter, despite letting slip a 5-2 lead in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always trust myself to play in these big stages," an emotional Wong said after the match. "This is for you Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182th in the world, becomes the second-lowest ranked player to reach the tournament's last 32 in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He already made history by beating world number 82 Daniel Altmaier of Germany in the first round, becoming the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's top men's player will next face Australia's Adam Walton, the lucky loser who's also enjoying a magical run at the prestigious Masters 1000 event.

    Protests continue in Turkey after mayor arrested

<img alt="A protester in Istanbul waves Turkey's national flag. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796993_1_20250323083846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Huge crowds gathered outside Istanbul City Hall late on Saturday for a fourth night of protests over the arrest of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who has blasted official allegations against him as "immoral and baseless".
 <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations, which began in Istanbul on Wednesday, have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, sparking clashes with riot police in the country's worst street protests in more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imamoglu's arrest -- for "terrorism" and "corruption" -- came just days before he was to have been formally named as the main opposition CHP's candidate in the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dictators are cowards!" and "AKP (Turkey's ruling party), you will not silence us!" read some of the placards in the Istanbul protest on Saturday night, which appeared bigger and denser than the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers charged the City Hall gathering shortly after midnight (2100 GMT) using tear gas and forcing those who could to take refuge in the City Hall building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many were arrested, according to AFP journalists, but no official data was immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riot police had earlier used rubber bullets, pepper spray and percussion grenades in clashes on the fringes of the rally, AFP correspondents said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local AKP offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, addressing the massed protesters in Istanbul, told them they numbered "more than half a million".
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed the mobilisation would "defend" Imamoglu and march on the courthouse where the mayor had been taken late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor was taken to the courthouse, about 10 kilometres away from the City Hall demonstration, with 90 of his co-defendants, protected by dozens of riot vans and a heavy police cordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Imamoglu's lawyers, his hearing on a "terrorism" charge concluded, while the hearing on a "corruption" charge was scheduled to follow in the middle of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police set up a tight security cordon around the courthouse while around 1,000 protesters stood nearby shouting slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, the 53-year-old mayor denounced the accusations against him as "immoral and baseless" in a statement released by City Hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This process has not only harmed Turkey's international reputation but has also shattered the public's sense of justice and trust in the economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the mayor's arrest badly hurt the lira and caused chaos on Turkey's financial markets with the benchmark BIST 100 index closing Friday nearly 8.0 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are here today to stand up for the candidate we voted for," 30-year-old Aykut Cenk told AFP outside the court, holding a Turkish flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just as people took the streets to stand up for Erdogan after the July 15 (2016) coup, we are now taking to the streets for Imamoglu," Cenk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not the enemy of the state, but what is happening is unlawful."
  <br>
  <br>
  The unrest has spread rapidly despite a protest ban in Turkey's three largest cities and a warning from Erdogan that the authorities would not tolerate "street terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  "For four days, they have been doing everything they can to disturb the peace and divide our people," Erdogan said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The days when politics and justice are guided by street terror are totally in the past," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the evening, Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said the authorities would not allow anyone to enter or leave the city who was "likely to participate in illegal activities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have arrested 343 people since the start of the protests, the interior ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey's Journalists Union claimed the police had "deliberately targeted" journalists, saying many had been "severely beaten, shot with rubber bullets and had equipment broken".
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Imamoglu's detention, the CHP has vowed to press ahead with its primary on Sunday at which it would formally nominate him as the party's presidential candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has pledged to open voting to anyone, not just party members, in the hope of garnering massive support for the beleaguered mayor, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Observers said the government would likely seek to block the vote. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British finance minister Rachel Reeves is eyeing spending cuts for government officials who work in departments to the value of around 1.5 billion pounds (US$1.94 billion) a year by 2028-29, The Times newspaper reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reeves will likely announce belt-tightening measures to get back on track to meet her fiscal rules next Wednesday when she delivers a half-yearly budget update speech alongside fresh economic and public finance forecasts from Britain's fiscal watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is expected to reduce the administration budgets for the civil service by 10 percent, saving around 1.5 billion pounds a year by the end of parliament, The Times said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move could put thousands of jobs at risk and covers back office jobs, including in communications and policy, and human resources, but will likely exclude frontline service roles such as the border force and prisons. (Reuters)

    Pope Francis to be discharged from hospital

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for more than five weeks, will be discharged from hospital on Sunday but will need a further two months of rest at the Vatican, the head of his medical team said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Francis will return to the Vatican on Sunday, his doctors said it would take "a lot of time" for his aging body to fully heal.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they had prescribed the pope two months of repose, and had advised him against taking any meetings with large groups, or that require special effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recommendation for a period of convalescence of at least two months is very important," Sergio Alfieri, head of the pope's medical team, told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis, who was fighting double pneumonia, suffered four acute attacks of what the Vatican called "respiratory crises" during his time in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri said that two of the crises had been critical, with the pope "in danger of his life".
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff no longer has pneumonia, but is also not completely healed from a "complex" infection involving several microorganisms, said the doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri emphasized that while Francis had used non-invasive ventilation through a mask over his mouth and nose to help breathe, the pope had never been intubated during his stay in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One senior cardinal had said on Friday that the pope would need to "relearn to speak" after battling a respiratory infection for so long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will take time before his voice returns to what it was before," said Alfieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The doctor said the pope, who had gained some weight in recent years after using a wheelchair for knee and back pain, has now lost some weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We haven't weighed him, but he has lost weight, surely," said Alfieri. "But, let's say, he had some 'in reserve,' so it doesn't worry us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Luigi Carbone, vice director of the Vatican's healthcare service, said the pope would have a nurse caring for him when he returns to his Vatican residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said earlier on Saturday that Francis would make his first public appearance in more than five weeks on Sunday, to offer a blessing from the window of his hospital room before being discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has been seen by the public only once during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis wants to come to the hospital window around noon on Sunday to give a greeting and blessing, the Vatican said in its brief statement earlier on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A period of two months rest for Francis could lead to significant changes to the Vatican's calendar of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had been set to meet with Britain's King Charles on April 8, and to lead the Vatican's annual celebrations for Easter on April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said on Saturday that the Vatican would decide about those appointments at a later date.

 A pumped Oscar Piastri seized his first Formula One pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday and said he had done the hairpin of his life to smash the Shanghai circuit record.

  <br>
  The Australian, who had previously only secured the top slot for 100km sprint races, told reporters his qualifying time of one minute 30.641 seconds was secured at the end of the straight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My first lap was honestly better than my second lap, but just at the hairpin at the end of the straight I lost a bit of time and didn’t do the best hairpin," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the second lap I was about two-tenths down on myself, so I kind of just went 'why not send it into the hairpin?' and I gained those two-tenths back and then found a little bit more in the last corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, without that, I was tempted to box (pit) before that. So I’m pretty happy now that I didn’t...I just did a good corner, that’s all."
  <br>
  <br>
  As he told his team over the radio, it was "the hairpin of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  Now in his third season in Formula One, Piastri already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite for a third on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would make up for the crushing disappointment of starting on the front row in his home race in Melbourne last weekend and sliding off while chasing winning team mate Lando Norris before finishing ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris leads the championship on 26 points, with Piastri level with Ferrari's sprint winner Lewis Hamilton on nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pole was the first for an Australian driver since Daniel Ricciardo for Red Bull in Mexico in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a racing driver, so I'm selfish. So it's nice to do it for myself but it is also nice to do it for Australia as well," said the 23-year-old, who added that he has Chinese heritage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pole position is a really good confidence boost. It’s obviously my first one. So it's always nice to tick that box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a good start to the whole year for both the team and myself, even if the points tally doesn’t look like that at the moment. So (I'm) happy with how things are going, and this is a nice step along the way." (Reuters)

 The government is demanding that ticketing platform Cityline fix printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued late on Saturday, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Cityline should deal with the matter swiftly so ticket holders would not be affected. The British band is due to perform at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Cityline's website, the inaccurate information is printed on the $1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour—delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cityline said it was extending ticket exchanges and adding locations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. It also apologised and said it would refund handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland ticket holders have also been complaining about Cityline on Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law's Xiaohongshu social media page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it had received 17 complaints as of 7 pm on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan visited two mainland firms in Beijing on Friday, highlighting Hong Kong's role as a gateway for business expansion and global market access.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan first visited a leading pop-culture entertainment company listed in Hong Kong, which operates popular intellectual property (IP) artistic toys. He toured the company's thematic park and met with senior management to discuss their business development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He welcomed the firm's plans to expand its physical retail network in Hong Kong and diversify services, noting that the SAR government is reviewing tax deductions for acquiring IP usage rights to boost the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, Chan visited a high-precision artificial intelligence (AI) firm specialising in intelligent sensing solutions for smart traffic management, autonomous driving, perception robots, and low-altitude economic applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, with projects in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, plans to establish its international headquarters and a global R&D centre in Hong Kong while preparing for a listing. Chan encouraged the firm to utilise Hong Kong's capital, talent, and professional services to expand internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan was due to attend the China Development Forum on Saturday and speak at the thematic seminar.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement called on its Islamist rivals Hamas on Saturday to relinquish power in order to safeguard the "existence" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men," said Fatah spokesman Monther al-Hayek.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on Hamas to "step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians' existence" if it remains in power in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007 from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, and subsequent attempts at reconciliation have failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The territory has been devastated by an Israeli offensive in retaliation for the assault by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following disagreements over the next steps in a January 19 ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israel resumed air strikes on Tuesday, followed by ground operations the day after.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to annexe parts of Gaza unless Hamas frees the remaining Israeli hostages seized in the October 7 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken that day, 58 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the war, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three firefighters and a public servant have been killed in a wildfire in South Korea, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in southeastern regions, authorities said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in Sancheong County on Friday afternoon, prompted the deployment of 304 personnel, along with 20 helicopters, according to South Korea's Interior Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 residents in 15 southern villages have been told to evacuate, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four people – three firefighters and one public servant – have been confirmed to be dead," said a fire agency official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occurred in several other areas across the country, with 16 instances reported on Saturday alone, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Interior Ministry later declared a state of emergency in Ulsan and North and South Gyeongsang provinces, due to "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in 12 locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancheong, in South Gyeongsang province, is about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sections of the highways in the region have been closed as a safety measure, according to local reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Sang-mok, South Korea's acting president, told relevant agencies to "mobilise all available equipment and personnel to quickly extinguish" the fire, his office said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two people including a girl were killed in an Israeli attack on a southern Lebanese town on Saturday, state media reported, after Israel launched air strikes in response to cross-border rocket fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli enemy strike on the town of Touline resulted... in the death of two people, including a girl, and the injury of eight others, including two children," the National News Agency cited the health ministry's emergency unit as saying, describing it as a "preliminary toll."
  <br>
  <br>
  NNA had earlier reported a toll of one killed in Touline.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as the Israeli military said it was launching air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon after intercepting cross-border rocket fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said three rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the region for the first time since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam warned the country risked being dragged into a "new war" after months of relative calm following a November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis will make his first public appearance on Sunday with a blessing and a wave from a window at Rome's Gemelli Hospital where he was admitted on February 14.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling pneumonia in both lungs after being hospitalised for breathing difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pope Francis intends to wave and offer a blessing from the Agostino Gemelli hospital in Rome after Angelus prayers," The Vatican said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has stopped using an oxygen mask. After an earlier series of breathing attacks, his breathing has improved and the Vatican said on Monday he was spending short moments breathing on his own.
  <br>
  <br>
  For most of the pope's hospital stay, including critical stages, the Vatican was publishing daily bulletins on the health of Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope's illness and the long spell in hospital have raised questions over who might lead the busy schedule of religious events leading up to Easter, the holiest period in the Christian calendar. (AFP)

    Heathrow 'fully operational' again after fire shutdown

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heathrow Airport said it was "fully operational" on Saturday but delays and cancellations were expected as Europe's busiest air hub resumed operations after a power station fire caused travel mayhem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electricity substation blaze knocked out power at the London airport, closing it for most of Friday before some flights began to arrive and take off later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised serious questions about the reliability of one of the UK's most critical pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today," an airport spokesperson said on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delays and cancellations were likely on Saturday as airlines scrambled to clear a backlog of flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Airways said it expected to operate around 85 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport throughout the day. The airline would normally run about 600 arrivals and departures on a Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex," a BA spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect around 85 percent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday's power outage at the airport."
  <br>
  <br>
  Restrictions on overnight flights have been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, according to the UK's transport department. (AFP)

  Those affected are part of a group that includes 120 students from the Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College who are on a three-day trip to Zhaoqing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said some people had developed gastroenteritis symptoms, such as vomiting and fever since Friday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said they are receiving treatment at a local hospital and are in stable condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it had notified the Education Bureau, the Centre for Health Protection and parents regarding the incident, and also taken measures to reduce the risk of infection to others.

 Kevin Durant scored 42 points as the Phoenix Suns reignited their playoff hopes with a 123-112 upset of the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A superb performance from Durant secured a third straight victory for Phoenix as they aim to muscle their way into the postseason picture in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Durant erupted for 19 points in a third-quarter burst of scoring that took the game beyond Cleveland's grasp, with the Suns opening up a 98-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter which they never looked like letting slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Phoenix into 10th place in the Western Conference and into the play-in tournament reckoning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in each NBA conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while teams placed from 7th to 10th play in a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the best team in the league," Durant said of Cleveland following the Suns win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been struggling and we know we've got the toughest schedule for the last 10 games," he added. "So we just wanted to dial in and make sure we kept building on the work we've done over the last week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's fourth consecutive loss leaves the second-placed Boston Celtics just five wins behind the Cavs at the top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 51-19 after thrashing the Utah Jazz 121-99 on the back of 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis and 26 points from Jayson Tatum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Detroit Pistons' progress towards the playoffs suffered a jolt in a surprising 123-117 defeat on the road to the struggling Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs – whose season has been blown off course by the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers and a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving – powered to a precious victory thanks to 31 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 27 from PJ Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves Dallas perched on the edge of playoff contention in 11th place with a 34-37 record in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit occupy the sixth and last automatic playoff berth in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the loss, the Pistons will fancy their chances of locking down a postseason ticket given a vastly superior record – 39-32 – to seventh-placed Atlanta (33-36).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their successful clinching of the number 1 seeding on Thursday with a ruthless 141-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder were assured of top spot in the West despite not playing on Thursday after the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat to Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points as no fewer than eight OKC players finished in double figures in a wire-to-win which leaves the Thunder with a 58-12 record at the top of the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said he wanted to see his team play with the same intensity for the remainder of the regular season as they build towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got to play with a sense of purpose – you can't coast into the postseason," Daigneault said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great 48-minute effort. We played to our standards on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  With OKC already assured of top spot, Houston boosted their hopes of clinching second place in the West after rallying from 11 points down to squeeze past the Miami Heat, winning 102-98 on the road to bag their ninth consecutive win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet was the key man for Houston, finishing with 37 points after a devastating exhibition of long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  VanVleet drained nine-of-11 attempts from outside the arc as the Rockets improved to 46-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves remain hard on the heels of the sixth-placed Golden State Warriors (41-29) in the race for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves, who are one place behind Golden State, improved to 41-31 after a 134-93 pasting of the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another upset, the Portland Trail Blazers outgunned the injury-hit Denver Nuggets 128-109. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Saturday that a 35-year-old woman remains in a critical condition, after she was sedated before a tooth extraction at a dental clinic in Central two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deep sedation was used before the surgery, and the woman failed to wake up after the extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to hospital immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, the clinic stopped offering sedation to patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clinic also reported the sentinel event to the department and it has submitted an investigation report as requested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will decide whether or not to take any further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the investigation, the department also found that the clinic did not properly manage patients’ medical records and medication, nor implement effective infection control.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure patient safety, the department has requested that the clinic improve its procedures.
