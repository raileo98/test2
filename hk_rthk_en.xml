<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland rebounded from defeat to New Zealand by edging Argentina 22-19 in a nailbiting one-off rugby union Test at Lansdowne Road on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish led by 13 points at the break but a lack of discipline and excellent play by the Pumas almost gave the visitors their first ever win in Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went right down to the wire there," Ireland skipper Caelen Doris told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were happy with how it started. There was a good feeling through the warm-up and that carried over to the start. I felt we were in a pretty good position at half time and their quality showed in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ireland started brightly but it was the Pumas who thought they had struck first through Matias Moroni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead Moroni trudged off after receiving a yellow card for a head collision with Irish fly-half Jack Crowley earlier in the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Crowley who was celebrating a minute later as he went over for his second Test try and converting it for 7-0 in the fourth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barely a minute had passed since Crowley's try when Garry Ringrose broke through the centre and a sublime pass by Jamison Gibson-Park found Tadhg Beirne, who selflessly passed inside to Mack Hansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-born wing touched down for his 10th Test try -- Crowley failed to convert but the Irish were 12-0 up inside six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz got his team on the board with a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish piled the pressure on the visitors and were denied a third try after Beirne knocked on as he went to touch the ball down.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they lost prop Finlay Bealham to a yellow card in the 17th minute for a dangerous tackle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Farrell looked rueful in the coach's box as Bealham trotted off with Albornoz knocking over the penalty for 12-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley landed a sweetly struck drop goal to make it 15-6 to the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz's unerring boot added three more points shortly before Bealham returned to the fray for 15-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas resisted waves of Irish attacks but finally cracked just after the half hour mark as Joe McCarthy powered over for his second Test try -- Crowley converted for 22-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Irish line somehow held out as the Pumas pressed in the final few minutes of the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ringrose turned the ball over and the hosts breathed easier as they headed in 22-9 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Pumas responded brilliantly after the break, fullback Juan Cruz Mallia broke through from deep, Ringrose and Hansen failing to bring him down, and touched down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz converted for 22-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish discipline was creaking just as it did against the All Blacks, conceding three penalties within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Paul Williams had had enough of Irish offsides and sent McCarthy to the sin bin much to Farrell's frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz moved past 100 points in Test rugby with a smoothly taken penalty for 22-19 and just under half an hour to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The penalty count went to 10 as Crowley took out Albornoz in the air, but at the end of the next phase of play the Pumas' fly-half sent a drop goal attempt wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farrell rang the changes just after the hour including replacing Crowley with 21-year-old Sam Prendergast for his first cap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night came in the 67th minute as prop Cian Healy came on to equal Brian O'Driscoll's Irish record of 133 caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish were hanging on but received a huge boost when Pumas replacement Francisco Gomez Kodela was sin-binned for a head shot on Doris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas were the ones pressing right at the end and were inside the 22 when the Irish managed to turn the ball over. (AFP)

    US, European markets fall on interest rate jitters

<img alt="US markets finished lower as traders pondered comments from the head of the US central bank signalling that it was in no hurry to cut interest rates. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779429_1_20241116075502.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global stock markets ended the week on a sour note on Friday as traders digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that the US central bank was not on a preset path to cut interest rates.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Powell indicated the Fed was in no hurry to cut rates as it monitors inflation's downward trajectory, Wall Street turned red, with all three major indices closing lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly Powell's speech has triggered some skepticism about the path of rates, with potentially December being a skip instead of another cut," Edward Jones senior investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we do have another inflation and jobs report before that, so there is still a good sense we might see another rate cut in December," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 percent to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent to 18,680.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading the way down were a clutch of vaccine-makers' stocks after US President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London was off 0.1 percent, digesting disappointing growth data. Frankfurt and Paris also ended in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disappointing US retail sales in October did not help overall sentiment as oil prices also drifted down.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech on Thursday, Powell said that "the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the US central bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, investors are scaling back their bets on how many cuts will be made next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are worried tax cuts and tariffs planned by Trump could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The (Trump) administration's renewed focus on tariffs could weigh heavily on currencies of trade-exposed economies, particularly those in Asia and the eurozone," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  European markets stuttered as the European Commission predicted economic growth would pick up slightly and inflation would keep falling in the eurozone next year, but warned of growing risks linked to geopolitical tensions. (AFP)

    Hamas official says 'ready' for Gaza ceasefire

<img alt="Most of Gaza has been reduced to rubble over the past 13 months. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779374_1_20241115202323.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Hamas official said on Friday that the group is "ready for a ceasefire" in Gaza and urged US President-elect Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the war.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas is ready to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip if a ceasefire proposal is presented and on the condition that it is respected" by Israel, said Hamas political bureau member Bassem Naim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call on the US administration and Trump to pressure the Israeli government to end the aggression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas informed the mediators that it is in favour of any proposal submitted to it that would lead to a definitive ceasefire and military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, allowing the return of displaced people, a serious deal for a prisoner exchange, the entry of humanitarian aid and reconstruction," Naim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands are the same ones Hamas has made in successive rounds of ceasefire negotiations since the start of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump promised peace in the Middle East and has vowed to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naim's comments come after Qatar said on Saturday that it had suspended its role as a key mediator for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gulf emirate, which has hosted Hamas's political leadership since 2012 with US blessing, has been involved in months of protracted diplomacy aimed at ending the war triggered by the Palestinian group's attack on Israel on October 7 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,764 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Spanish regional leader admits 'mistakes' over floods

<img alt="Carlos Mazon admits he was having lunch on the afternoon of the disaster. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779377_1_20241115203421.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Spain's eastern Valencia region admitted on Friday to "mistakes" in handling the country's deadliest floods in decades that killed 216 people there and apologised.
 <br>
  <br>
  The October 29 disaster claimed 224 lives nationwide. The floods wrecked infrastructure, gutted buildings and submerged fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final bill is expected to soar to tens of billions of euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to deny mistakes," Carlos Mazon told Valencia's regional parliament, adding he was "not going to shirk any responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  As the head of the regional government "I would like to apologise" to those who "felt" that "the aid did not arrive or was not enough," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he spoke, dozens of protesters gathered outside the building, jeering and chanting slogans demanding his resignation and calling him a liar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost half the people killed in Valencia were 70 years old or older and 26 were foreigners, including two Britons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage at the authorities for their perceived mismanagement before and after the floods triggered mass protests on Saturday, the largest in Valencia city which drew 130,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several carried placards that read: "Our hands are stained with mud, theirs with blood."
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics have questioned the efficiency of the Valencia region's alert system. In some cases, residents were only contacted by telephone when floodwater was already gushing through towns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergency alert was only sent after 8 pm, nearly 13 hours after the state weather agency warned of the risk of "very intense" rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of Valencia's emergency department admitted she did not learn it was possible to send such warnings until the evening of the first day of the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under Spain's decentralised system of government, regional governments lead disaster response.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Socialist-led central government has said Mazon's administration, run by the conservative Popular Party (PP), bore responsibility for not issuing the alert earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mazon has also come under fire for having been missing for several critical hours on the afternoon of the disaster when it was already raining heavily.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to repeated questions for explanations for his absence, he finally admitted he had been having lunch with a journalist to offer her the directorship of the regional television station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have complained they were left without food and water for days and had to rely on aid provided by volunteers instead of the government. (AFP)

    COP29 summit denounced as 'no longer fit for purpose'

<img alt="A coalition of NGOs says more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are attending COP29. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779379_1_20241115205149.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oil executives and lobbyists descended on COP29 in Baku for "energy day" on Friday, as environmental groups denounced the presence of the fossil fuel industry at the UN climate talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  While negotiators haggled over the key goal of an increase in climate funding, a former UN chief denounced the talks as "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of France's TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said the sector is "part of the problem," but insisted it was making "continuous progress" on transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Kick the Big Polluters Out" (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the annual climate confab, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests are in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fossil fuel industry is creating havoc in people's lives, the fossil fuel industry is responsible for destruction," said Makoma Lekalakala, a South African environmental campaigner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The presence of oil, gas and coal interests at the climate talks has long been a source of controversy, and the appointment of UAE state oil firm head Sultan Al Jaber to head last year's negotiations in Dubai stoked criticism.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's host is energy-rich Azerbaijan, whose President Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday repeated his insistence that oil and gas are a "gift of God."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US vice president and climate activist Al Gore warned on Thursday that "the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Dubai summit produced a global agreement on "transitioning away" from fossil fuels, the follow-up commitment "has been very weak" and the issue "is hardly even mentioned" at COP29, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to think that one of the reasons for that is that the petrostates have too much control over the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of leading climate activists and scientists including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned on Friday that the COP process was "no longer fit for purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  They urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michai Robertson, lead negotiator on climate change for the Alliance of Small Island States, said the talks remained crucial for vulnerable nations shut out of forums like the G20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the only time that our voice can be clearly heard," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  KBPO said Japan brought employees of coal giant Sumitomo as part of its delegation, Canada included oil producers Suncor and Tourmaline and Italy brought employees of energy giants Eni and Enel.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, some of those on the NGO list work for companies that are not primarily fossil fuel-related, including Danish offshore wind champion Orsted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority at the talks is a new figure for climate finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change and transition their economies away from fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rich nations are reluctant to spend much more than the US$100 billion a year already committed, conscious of domestic publics angry about inflation and stuttering economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But developing countries warn they need at least US$1 trillion to defend against the ravages of climate change and meet commitments to reach net-zero emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators are struggling to agree on a workable draft text before ministers arrive next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must be honest, we believe that the pace of their work is currently too slow," warned COP29 lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev on Friday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanging over proceedings is the question of what role the United States will play on climate action and funding after Donald Trump returns to the White House in January, given his pledge to again withdraw from the landmark Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  American officials at the talks have insisted Trump will struggle to undo the climate action already in motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When history is written, he will be looked at as a speed bump on the tremendous growth of this clean energy transition," the Democratic governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee, told an event on Friday. (AFP)

    Pakistan extends school closures in Punjab by a week

<img alt="Punjab's environment minister has urged residents to " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779387_1_20241115215108.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab on Friday extended school closures in smog-hit major cities by a week, as the country battles record air pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The schools will remain closed for another week due to the hazardous air quality. Institutes including universities would switch to online classes to ensure the safety of students," Marriyum Aurangzeb, Punjab's environment minister, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air quality in Lahore was deemed "hazardous," according to data from IQAir, with the concentration of deadly PM2.5 pollutants – fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health – around 30 times the level deemed acceptable by the World Health Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 35,000 patients have been reported in the hospitals of Lahore due to smog-related health issues in almost a month," Aurangzeb added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also urged residents to "stop roaming around on bikes and in cars and to wear masks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The province, home to more than half of Pakistan's 240 million people, had previously closed all schools until November 17.
  <br>

  The UN's food agency says transport is the main cause of air pollution in Pakistan, followed by industry and agriculture.

  Children are often hardest hit, with Unicef noting that "prior to these record-breaking levels of air pollution, about 12 percent of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were due to air pollution." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A collection of guitars and other musical equipment owned by influential rock guitarist Jeff Beck will go on sale in London in January, Christie's auctioneers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the 130 guitars, amps and "tools of the trade" used by Beck during his decades-spanning career are expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) when they go under the hammer on January 22, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include the rock legend's 1954 "Oxblood" Gibson Les Paul, famously depicted on the cover of his seminal 1975 solo instrumental album "Blow By Blow" and used on several tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is estimated to fetch up to £500,000 (US$634,000).
  <br>
  <br>
  Beck, who rose to stardom with 1960s supergroup The Yardbirds and later enjoyed a prolific solo career, died in January last year aged 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Sandra Beck, said it was "a massive wrench" to part with the instruments but that they needed to be "shared, played and loved again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guitars were his great love and after almost two years of his passing, it's time to part with them as Jeff wished," she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the future guitarists who acquire these items are able to move closer to the genius who played them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The collection includes another Gibson Les Paul from 1958, dubbed the original "Yardburst" as it was bought in 1966 while Beck was in the seminal British rock group. It is valued at up to £60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a Fender Telecaster and Gibson hybrid crafted by world-renowned guitar designer Seymour Duncan specifically for Beck in 1973 is predicted to sell for as much as £150,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlights from the guitar haul will be on public view in Los Angeles on December 4-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The full collection will go on show for a week at Christie's London headquarters before the January 22 sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie's Amelia Walker said the auctioneers were "honoured to have been entrusted" with the sale of instruments belonging to a "rock pioneer whose influence on his peers was unmatched."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added Beck's guitars had "shared his emotion and voice" with the world and the auction would "pay tribute to his enduring legacy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson could not wait to put on the gloves to take a shot at upcoming opponent Jake Paul, striking the social media influencer-turned-boxer in the face as they approached each other at Thursday's weigh-in at Arlington, Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-time "Baddest Man on the Planet," 58-year-old Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years against "ultimate heel" Paul in the wildly anticipated showdown at the AT&T Stadium on Friday (8 pm EST).
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no love lost between the two as Tyson, who weighed in at 228.4 pounds, approached Paul and immediately slapped the 27-year-old in the face and offered a two-word televised remark before walking off stage: "Talking's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, who gained a cult following on YouTube before turning to boxing four years ago, was far more loquacious, offering an expletive-riddled rant about his plans to demolish Tyson, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's angry, he's an angry little elf," said Paul, who weighed in at 227.2 pounds. "It's personal now – he must die!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight is the first live boxing match that Netflix has aired, as the streamer with more than 280 million subscribers makes inroads into the sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match has drawn extraordinary global interest but also criticism, with British promoter Eddie Hearn dismissing the bout as "dangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, said in an interview last month that the fight was not about the payday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not for financial reasons. My life is not going to change, not one percentage point after this fight. We will always be able to live this way," he said. "And I'm just doing it because I want to test myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, Paul will get US$40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August. Tyson will get US$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tyson's last professional fight was a loss against Kevin McBride in 2005. The fight against Paul will be shorter: eight two-minute rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12 three-minute rounds. Both boxers will also use heavier 14-ounce gloves instead of the typical 10-ounce gloves. (Reuters/AP)

    Landslide win for Sri Lanka president's coalition

<img alt="Anura Kumara Dissanayake's leftist coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779382_1_20241115211555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake thanked voters on Friday for delivering his leftist coalition a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections that repudiated establishment parties blamed for triggering an economic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, a self-avowed Marxist, swept September presidential elections on a promise to combat graft and recover stolen assets, two years after a slow-motion financial crash imposed widespread hardships on the island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to immediately call polls and secure parliamentary backing for his agenda was vindicated on Friday, with his National People's Power (NPP) coalition taking at least 159 seats in the 225-member assembly – exceeding a two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to all who voted for a renaissance," Dissanayake said in a brief statement on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coalition had a monumental 61.5 percent of the vote while opposition leader Sajith Premadasa's party was well behind with only 17.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People voted to get rid of corruption and a corrupt system," said IT professional Chanaka Rajapaksha, who supported the NPP in the polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sign of the magnitude of support for Dissanayake, his party won the most votes in the northern district of Jaffna, dominated by the island's minority Tamil community, for the first time since independence from Britain in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voter turnout was estimated at under 70 percent, less than the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September's presidential polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake, the 55-year-old son of a labourer, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stormed to the presidency after successfully distancing himself from successive leaders blamed for steering the country to its 2022 economic crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial crash was the worst in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka's history as an independent nation, sparking months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The resulting public anger culminated in the storming of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's pledge to change a "corrupt" political culture has resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation's finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very happy about this victory," said voter Nilusha Nilmini after the scale of the win became clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All this time, the country was governed by thieves, robbers and corrupt people. I am very happy that the crooks are out and a clean government has been established."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake's JVP party, the main constituent in the NPP coalition, led two insurrections in 1971 and 1987 that resulted in at least 80,000 deaths.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he was sworn in after presidential polls described as one of the island nation's most peaceful elections. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."

    Govt unveils action plan on green maritime fuel

<img alt="Officials say they aim to switch 55 percent of the diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779355_1_20241115181359.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday announced an action plan on green maritime fuel bunkering, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from the cargo industry and expand the use of green maritime fuels among government fleets and ships registered in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to switch 55 percent of the diesel-fuelled vessels to green maritime fuels by 2026, and cut carbon emissions at the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals by 30 percent in 2030 compared with 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said Hong Kong is currently ranked seventh as a global bunkering hub, offering strategic advantages for international ships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the present moment, we do not have any forecast on the economic benefits. But one of the side benefits of attracting ships to use our bunkering services is that... there will be opportunities for them to use our cargo handling," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also opportunities for them to use the Hong Kong maritime services. So this would be added values for Hong Kong to ensure that we maintain [our role] as the international maritime centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about difficulties in transitioning to green fuels, Director of Marine Wong Sai-fat said existing engines are tailor-made for specific fuel types and can't easily switch to alternatives like LNG or methanol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By large, the government vessels are using the diesel engine and the petrol engine. For the use of the petrol engine, it's using the petroleum, and that is not easy or straightforward that you can use other alternative fuel to replace the petrol engine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong added that diesel engines are more adaptable and can mix with biofuel, which is already being used in several government vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also said it will provide training to nurture talent in the field of green maritime fuel, with 50 people expected to be trained by 2026.

<img alt="Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of this year's US presidential election and endorsed Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779324_1_20241115153158.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist who has spread misinformation on vaccines, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, the top health agency in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Kennedy vowed to work to end chronic diseases, clean up corruption and provide Americans with the data they needed to make informed decisions, vowing to Trump that he would work to "Make America Healthy Again”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy ran for president in this year's election as an independent before dropping out in August and endorsing Trump, in exchange for a role in the Republican's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country," Trump said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appointment, which had been seen as a possibility for weeks, raised concern among some public health advocates who said Kennedy could have a negative role in Americans' health given his power over public health agencies. The Democratic Party decried the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some politicians and business groups supported the nomination, such as the National Community Pharmacists Association, which said it was encouraged by his willingness to take on corporations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among Kennedy's suggestions is that he would gut the 18,000-employee Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – which ensures the safety of food, drugs and medical devices – and replace hundreds of employees at the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "FDA's war on public health is about to end," he wrote on X in late October, adding that includes its "aggressive suppression" of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, sunshine and other items.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you work for the FDA and are part of this corrupt system, I have two messages for you: 1. Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, fell after news of Kennedy's appointment and were down in after-hours trading by as much as two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy has been criticised for making false medical claims, including that vaccines are linked to autism. He opposed state and federal restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic and was accused of spreading misinformation about the virus.

 Lawmakers on Friday passed a motion of thanks for Chief Executive John Lee's Policy Address this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the third and final day of the discussion at Legco, retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu brought up the need to transform the local economy as mentioned by the CE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu said his sector – amid recent struggles – faces similar challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now there's a shift in the consumption pattern of these mainland visitors. E-commerce is all the rage these days, and local residents are glad to head north for dining and shopping," Shiu, who also chairs the Liberal Party, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I said, let's recognise the new situation, let's use technology so that our goods are sold not just locally... let's use the online platform and promote our products elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shiu also called on entrepreneurs to take a major part in the development of the Northern Metropolis, saying they should be confident about the country and the SAR and that the project would produce great returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee sector lawmaker Doreen Kong, for her part, noted that some tenants living in sub-divided units (SDUs) said rents are rising as the government plans to regulate these homes and turn them into "basic housing units".
  <br>
  <br>
  The official leading a task force on the matter, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, said the government has confidence tackling the issue now because there are more flats in the pipeline to accommodate SDU tenants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stick to this people-centric and orderly approach," Wong said in the chamber.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can continue to boost the quantity and speed in building public housing, more SDU residents can move into public flats and demand for SDUs will gradually fall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials will give a report on the matter to the legislature at the start of next month, which will be followed by a two-month public consultation exercise.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government will issue retail infrastructure bond worth HK$20 billion next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-year bond will be linked to inflation and offer a minimum guaranteed interest of 3.5 percent, to be paid every six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's lower than the 4 percent for the latest round of silver bond offered by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, executive director for external affairs for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Kenneth Hui, said the interest for the retail infrastructure bond is still appealing to investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we set the interest rate, we do consider a combination of factors, including market conditions as well as the demand, as well as the interest rates of comparable products right now in the market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All things considered, we feel that 3.5 percent is an attractive rate, particularly considering the latest interest rate trend in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said each lot is worth HK$10,000, and each investor will be allocated a maximum of 100 lots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription period will last from November 26 to December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bond will be issued on December 17 and listed on the local bourse the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceeds will be used to finance infrastructure projects, including new towns and airport development.

    US golfer Reed ready for another HK Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 34-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

 Runners and organisers of the Hong Kong Oxfam Trailwalker on Friday braced for a rainy start and a mischievous troop of monkeys.
 <br>
  <br>
  An online video showed that dozens of monkeys were raiding a supply station set up along the route, ransacking for food and delving into a torn blue-and-white striped nylon bag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, Oxfam Hong Kong’s director of fundraising and communications, said it is hard to prevent the animals from enjoying what he called a "once-a-year, all-you-can-eat buffet" at the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said volunteers could only replenish food and supplies at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oxfam Trailwalker is one of the city's largest fundraising events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Participants are given 48 hours to complete the 100-kilometre run, kicking off at Pak Tam Chung in Sai Kung and finishing at Harrow International School Hong Kong in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also a shorter 40-kilometre race.

    'Some fan heaters not energy efficient'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council said on Friday bladeless fans with heating functions may not be as energy efficient as some other products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog found 11 models it tested took longer to heat up the room than traditional fan heaters it tested previously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The models were also found to have different airflow rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average is 16.1 cubic metres per minute, three of them had an airflow rate of 10 cubic metres or less per minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are talking about the airflow rate for different bladeless fans, we found it quite diverse. The energy efficiency, as well, is also quite diverse. Don't assume the fact that this kind of fans are very similar in terms of energy consumption. In actual fact, there are more energy-saving ones for you to select," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more you use energy-efficient appliances, the more you save for your expenses, but furthermore, you help to save the environment as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said by contrast, reverse-cycle air conditioners, which offers both heating and cooling in one system, may be more energy efficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said it's ultimately up to consumers to choose what they want to use.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are pros and cons. If you are talking about the reverse-cycle air conditioner, its heating capacity is much better and energy efficiency is much better," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But when you are talking about the installation, the cost by itself obviously is higher, and also the mobility of it is not there because it's fixed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department could consider including different types of electric fans in the Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme, so consumers can compare products.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong authorities on Friday kicked off their first cybersecurity drill in a bid to enhance their defence capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event involves a number of government departments and public bodies handling cyberattacks carried out by some members of the IT industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innovation and technology minister Sun Dong said cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the digital economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maintaining online security is an important part of promoting high-quality economic development and building smart cities. This long-term task is always ongoing, and never finished," Sun said in a speech marking the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sincerely hope that participating teams, as well as observing departments and organisations, will seize this opportunity to test yourself and improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that eight mainland cybersecurity firms with experience with such drills offered technical support and suggestions for this exercise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drill was organised by the Digital Policy Office and co-hosted by various departments, such as the police cybersecurity and tech crimes unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not reveal which government systems are involved in the drill.

    Scent boosters 'unnecessary add-ons for laundry'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Laundry scent boosters did not help with cleaning at all, the consumer watchdog said on Friday, as it found "varying types and concentrations" of fragrance allergens in all 12 samples it tested.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Except for one model with only one type of fragrance allergen, the remaining 11 models had three to eight types of fragrance allergens. The test also revealed that models with two-coloured scented granules generally had more types of fragrance allergens," the Consumer Council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also said a third of the scent boosters contained a musk compound, galaxolide, which is not readily biodegradable and highly toxic to aquatic organisms, potentially posing a threat to marine ecosystems in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12 in-wash scent boosters tested were priced ranged from HK$38 to HK$179 per bottle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of the models claim to help with softening fabrics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council considers these in-wash scent boosters as unnecessary add-ons for laundry as the contained fragrances have no effect on cleaning, while the cost per wash could reach a maximum of HK$21 based on the recommended usage," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, consumers should consider the long-term need for these products, especially if they or their family members are prone to skin or respiratory allergies. Should consumers choose to use these products, they should exercise caution when using, and at the same time keep them out of young children's reach to avoid accidental ingestion."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

    Document-free travel trial to mainland from next week

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, Macau and mainland travellers will be able to cross the border at two checkpoints without showing their travel documents starting next Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Immigration Administration said on Friday the trial scheme is meant for making things more convenient for travellers, as well as raising border clearance efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial will take place at self-service gates at the Shenzhen Bay checkpoint between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and the Gongbei crossing between Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme covers people aged 14 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  It applies to mainland residents who travel frequently for private but not business reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also applies to non-ethnic Chinese who have a mainland travel card.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Residents] who agree to the border inspection agency collecting facial information, fingerprints and other information for verification can choose to use the 'document-free' channel at border inspection, without showing physical travel documents," the authorities said in an announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said all travellers should still bring along their travel documents, in case officials need to check them after they cross the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities said the scheme would gradually expand to cover other border crossings, as well as children aged under 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee of the DAB, said her party welcomes the trial scheme, saying it's something they have been calling for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, this is a very important trial arrangement, a major step. It's a response to many Hong Kong people's demands for crossing the border even more conveniently," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her partymate and the convenor of the SAR's delegates to the National People's Congress, Brave Chan, said the move will boost the economies on all sides as travelling becomes more convenient.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Friday called for greater acceptance by the catering trade of customers' own containers when they order takeaways.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said proactive and flexible cooperation by eateries "is of crucial importance" to promote the container-free practice across Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumers need clear and easy-to-understand guidelines and promotion, complementing the operational procedures of eateries so that [bringing your own containers] can become a natural behaviour," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The council hopes that the government and the industry will work together to develop and promote reusable container lending services, so that the public can reduce the reliance on disposable containers and join hands to reduce plastic use at source."
  <br>
  <br>
  Checks by the council found some restaurants refusing to take boxes from outside for to-go orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August and September, the watchdog's staff members posed as customers and brought reusable food containers to 15 eateries during peak lunch hours on weekdays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of them were part of the government's bring-your-own-containers scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 45 attempts made for the restaurants to accept self-brought containers for takeaways, almost 70 percent were successful, with the watchdog finding eateries taking part in the government initiative more inclined to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said four of the 15 eateries refused to accept people's own containers citing food safety and hygiene concerns, with one restaurant employee displaying "a slightly impatient tone" without giving an explanation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others said to be accepting such containers were not able to entertain all requests citing practical constraints, such as the time being peak hours and the boxes being too small or dirty, the council added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The survey also found that none of the eateries offered discounts for [bringing your own containers], nor did they charge according to the number of disposable containers used on a 'user pays' basis, and some still charged [consumers who brought their own containers] for takeaway packaging," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong rolled out the first phase of a ban on single-use plastics in April, with restaurants prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates. People who fail to comply face fines of up to HK$100,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups will also be prohibited in the second phase of the ban. There's no timetable yet on when that would be put in force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity empowering people with genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders says members will be able to maintain their healthy lifestyle changes thanks to Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The first of 11 OSC beneficiaries this year, LOVE 21 supports Hong Kong’s Down syndrome and autistic communities through sport, nutrition and other programmes that include art therapy, music therapy, and African drumming.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carmel Armstrong, Chief Operating Officer of LOVE 21, said the charity – which now has 457 members – was founded to raise awareness of people who are rarely seen and often misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Just have a little think: when did you last see a Down syndrome or autistic person on a train, or kicking a football, or running in the public park? And the answer's probably not very often, or not recently anyway. And we believe that's because of the stigma that is attached to being disabled in this part of the world,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong said with funding from OSC this year, the charity will expand an existing comprehensive nutrition programme, called "Follow-up Nutrition and Sport Programme", to help their members lead healthier, longer lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People with Down syndrome are often born with a higher propensity to be obese, slower metabolism, often eyesight problems, heart problems. And our autistic people often need to put on weight, or they need to learn how to eat in a more varied manner. They often don't like certain textures or colours, and so trying to get them to eat healthily and exercise is important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Armstrong added the expansion would not only have members on the nutrition programme for a 12-month period, but it would also enable the charity to follow up with members to ensure they are maintaining good eating habits and meeting personal goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those who has been part of LOVE 21’s programmes is Nathan, who said he has been “happy, confident and independent” since taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Since I started the programmes here, most of it has helped in looking at better habits like better eating habits, better exercise habits and personal habits and making sure I make myself an intention to follow. I actually want this foundation to support as many people, as many friends that I have,” the member-turned-staff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    England triumph over Greece despite star absences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

    Powell lauds US economy as 'remarkably good'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The recent performance of the US economy has been "the best of any major economy in the world," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, a week after the bank cut interest rates for a second consecutive meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank recently started cutting back its key lending rates from a two-decade high, turning attention from tackling inflation to supporting the labor market as the rate of price increases has moderated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been widespread anger about the cumulative impact of years of inflation, which has pushed up consumer prices by more than 20 percent since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the economic facts today are clear, Powell said during an event in Dallas, Texas, noting that inflation was falling toward the Fed's long-term two percent target, the labor market was "solid," and economic growth remained resilient.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell noted that inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was "running much closer" to the bank's target, but had not reached it just yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting," he said, referring to the level of interest rates over the long run that keep both inflation and unemployment in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the path for getting there is not preset," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures traders currently place a probability of close to 60 percent that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

    Wall Street down as Fed comments dampen rate cut hopes

<img alt="US markets ended lower after comments from the US central bank appeared to dowse hopes of an imminent rate cut. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779222_1_20241115053414.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dampened investor hopes for another interest rate cut this year by saying the US central bank need not rush to ease monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Powell said at a Dallas Fed event that with the economy still growing, the job market solid and inflation still above the 2 percent target, the Fed can deliberate carefully on rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  While traders were still betting on a 25-basis point reduction at the Fed's December meeting, the probability sank to 55.5 percent from 76 percent earlier in the afternoon and from 82.5 percent on Wednesday, the CME Fed Watch tool showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The comments from Powell put more cold water on what used to be a very optimistic outlook on the path for rate cuts," said Adam Hetts, global head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we can't take for granted that inflation and labor are in balance so this is an encouraging message on the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell almost 0.47 percent, to 43,752. The S&P lost 0.61 percent, to end at 5,949, while the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 19,107.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday data showed the producer price index for final demand rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in October, in line with forecasts, though the annual rise of 2.4 percent was a touch higher than expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobless claims dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, lower than forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more evidence that inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2 percent target," said Melissa Brown, managing director for Investment Decision Research at SimCorp in New York. "The numbers were roughly in line with expectations but sometimes investors step back and say, 'What does this really mean?' It leads to more uncertainty about what the Fed does after the December meeting." (Reuters)

 The Observatory cancelled all tropical cyclone warning signals at 1.20am on Friday as Typhoon Toraji weakened and the threat to Hong Kong receded. .
 <br>
  <br>
  However, the Observatory said it's still monitoring another tropical cyclone, Tropical Cyclone Usagi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Tropical Cyclone Usagi is currently forecast to cross the Luzon Strait on Friday morning and enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it's expected to stay more than 500 kilometres from Hong Kong, posing little direct threat to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will then move northeastward toward the Ryukyu Islands and to gradually weaken.

    World's largest coral found near Solomon Islands

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing on Thursday a major discovery "pulsing with life and colour".
 <br>
  <br>
  The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they had stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and colour," marine ecologist Enric Sala said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The standalone structure had been growing for some 300 years, the researchers said, formed from a "complex network" of tiny coral polyps.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was distinct from a coral reef, which is made from many distinct coral colonies, they explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measuring 34 metres wide and 32 metres long, the team said the "mega coral" was three times bigger than the previous record holder – a coral dubbed "Big Momma" in American Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor," said lead scientist Molly Timmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was longer than a blue whale and was thought to be "so colossal" that it could "be seen from space".
  <br>
  <br>
  The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands in an area known as the Three Sisters.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope," said coral scientist Eric Brown. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    India's toxic smog hides landmarks, delays flights

<img alt="Dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779185_1_20241114203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toxic smog obscured India's famed monument to love, the Taj Mahal, as well as Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, becoming too thick to see through in several places.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city of Lahore in neighbouring Pakistan ranked as the world's most polluted in winter's annual scourge across the region, worsened by dust, emissions, and smoke from fires burnt illegally in India's farming states of Punjab and Haryana.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the city of Agra, the Taj Mahal was barely visible from the gardens in front of the 17th-century monument, while dense fog wreathed worshippers at the Golden Temple in Punjab, television images showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi flights also faced delays, with tracking website Flightradar24 showing 88 percent of departures and 54 percent of arrivals were delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials blamed high pollution, combined with humidity, becalmed winds and a drop in temperature for the smog, which cut visibility to 300 metres at the city's international airport, which diverted flights in zero visibility on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More patients flocked to hospitals, particularly children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has been a sudden increase in children with allergies, cough and cold ... and a rise in acute asthma attacks," Sahab Ram, a paediatrician in Punjab's Fazilka region, told news agency ANI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 16.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday from 17 degrees Celsius the previous day, weather officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its pollution ranked in the 'severe' category for the second consecutive day, with a score of 430 on an index of air quality maintained by the top pollution panel that rates a score of zero to 50 as 'good'.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pollution in New Delhi is likely to stay in the 'severe' category on Friday, the earth sciences ministry said, before improving to 'very poor', or an index score of 300 to 400.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of farm fires to clear fields in northern India has risen steadily this week to almost 2,300 on Wednesday from 1,200 on Monday, the ministry's website showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's eastern province of Punjab, was rated the world's most polluted city on Thursday, in live rankings kept by Swiss group IQAir. Authorities there have also battled hazardous air this month. (Reuters)

    China's Zeekr to take control of sister brand Lynk

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Geely said on Thursday its premium electric vehicle maker Zeekr plans to take control of sister brand Lynk & Co - the first big restructuring move in a planned overhaul for the sprawling automotive group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid," Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory downgraded the T3 signal to a T1 at 10.20pm on Thursday as tropical depression Toraji continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10pm, Toraji was estimated to be about 150 kilometres south-southwest of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move west slowly across the seas south of the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster said it will drop all typhoon signals when Toraji no longer poses a threat to the SAR.

<img alt="The High Court has sentenced the mastermind of a 2019 bomb plot to 23 years and 10 months in jail. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779166_1_20241114181953.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The mastermind of a plot to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019 was on Thursday jailed for more than 23 years while six others were slapped with jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 13 1/2 years each.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involving the "Dragon Slaying Brigade" was Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Chi-hung, whom the High Court heard was the mastermind in the case, was given the heaviest sentence of 23 years and 10 months after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to commit the bombing of prescribed objects and one count of possession of arms or ammunition with intent to endanger life.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chun-keung, described as the leader of the group, was sentenced to 13 years and six months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other defendants received jail terms ranging from five years and 10 months to 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trial, the High Court heard the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019, one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Li, chief superintendent from the national security police department, told reporters after the ruling that the heavy sentences reflected the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statements and evidence [presented in court] showed that this group had the capability and was very active in trying to carry out the action," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the police hadn't dismantled this group and their plan in time, it's believed that many people would have been impacted, including those participating in protests or innocent bystanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said the ruling shows that Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that the defendants were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment demonstrates that any person intending to plan and commit terrorist activities, endanger public security or disrupt society tranquillity can never escape sanctions of the law," it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the Department of Justice will study the reasons for sentencing and consider whether to appeal the sentences.

    Manpower shortage to more than triple by 2028

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will face a manpower crunch of 180,000 workers by 2028, compared with the shortage of 50,000 that was recorded last year, according to the government's manpower projection released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shortfall in the service industry was the worst last year, as it saw a shortage of 24,000 staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the situation would change by 2028 as jobs requiring skilled technicians would see a significant shortage of talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the city needs to find at least 60,000 additional staff to fill the shortfall, a six-fold increase from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun revealed the government already has plans to import 30,000 skilled workers in phases over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to allow qualified technical professionals, who may not have a graduate degree, they may be educated below the bachelor level, to allow them into Hong Kong to fill the gap," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one criteria we have to uphold is these people - they must be young technical professionals. By young, we mean those aged at or under 35."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun revealed the bureau came up with the projection after holding more than 170 consultation sessions with different industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the rapid development of AI and automation, saying that the labour shortfall would be worse without the help of technology.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    'Professionals need guidance on child abuse reports'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A child welfare organisation on Thursday urged the government to offer professionals guidance before a mandatory reporting mechanism for suspected child abuse comes into effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Against Child Abuse (ACA) said it handled about 1,000 enquiries between April last year and March this year, of which 185 involved child abuse fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation said more than 15 percent of the enquiries were from professionals, such as teachers, social workers and doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACA director Donna Wong said she expects the number of cases reported by professionals to gradually increase, as awareness has improved since Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong said sufficient preparatory work must be carried out before the legislation comes into effect in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that relevant support measures, such as the mandatory reporting guide, trainings for related professionals, the childcare residential placement, emergency placement and publicity education… will be well prepared in the 18-month transition period so that the mechanism will fully play its effectiveness,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, professionals who fail to report abuse cases risk a three-month jail term and a HK$50,000 fine.

    Philippines braces for more storms ahead

<img alt="Rescuers fetch residents during a forced evacuation operation in Buguey town, Cagayan province, north of Manila, ahead of Super Typhoon Usagi's landfall. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779129_1_20241114154252.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philippines raised its highest storm alert and evacuated thousands of people on Thursday, as Super Typhoon Usagi barrelled towards its already disaster-ravaged north.
 <br>
  <br>
  Packing sustained winds of up to 185 kilometres an hour, Usagi is set to hit the main island of Luzon later on Thurday -- the fifth storm to threaten the country in just three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brutal wave of weather disturbances has already killed 159 people and prompted the United Nations to request US$32.9 million in aid for the worst-affected regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national weather agency said the winds could cause "almost total damage to structures of light materials, especially in highly exposed coastal areas", and "heavy damage" to buildings otherwise considered "low-risk".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense to torrential rain" and potentially "life-threatening" coastal waves of up to three metres were also forecast over two days, with the storm warning raised to the highest signal on a five-step scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cagayan province, where the storm is expected to make landfall, officials worked in driving rain to remove residents along the coasts and on the banks of already swollen rivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yesterday it was preemptive evacuations. Now we're doing forced evacuations," local disaster official Edward Gaspar said, adding 1,404 residents were sheltering at a municipal gym.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more evacuees in nearby villages but we haven't had time to visit and count them," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cagayan's civil defence chief Rueli Rapsing said he expects local governments to take 40,000 people to shelters, roughly the same number that were preemptively evacuated ahead of Typhoon Yinxing, which struck Cagayan's north coast earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,000 Cagayan residents were still in shelters following the previous storms because the Cagayan River, the country's largest, remained swollen from heavy rain that fell in several provinces upstream.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Usagi, Tropical Storm Man-yi is also forecast to strike the Philippines' population heartland around the capital Manila this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Typhoons are overlapping. As soon as communities attempt to recover from the shock, the next tropical storm is already hitting them again," UN Philippines Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this context, the response capacity gets exhausted and budgets depleted."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people and keeping millions in enduring poverty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A recent study showed that storms in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly forming closer to coastlines, intensifying more rapidly and lasting longer over land due to climate change. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has confirmed that a free-trade agreement between Hong Kong and Peru will be signed this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee arrived in Lima on Wednesday evening local time, ahead of the Apec Economic Leaders’ meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook entry, the CE said he was greeted at the airport by Peruvian energy minister Romulo Mucho Mamani and Chinese Ambassador to Peru Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong began negotiating the pact with Peru in January 2023, with the agreement to cover goods and services, as well as investment and a dispute settlement mechanism. Talks concluded in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be Hong Kong’s ninth free-trade agreement with the existing eight covering 20 economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from securing the much-anticipated trade pact, the SAR leader will also attend bilateral meetings with other Apec leaders and meet local business representatives in Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth-largest trading partner in Latin America and 46th globally. Merchandise trade between the two places totalled HK$5.2 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong next Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed to seventh in a survey of economies ranking their global digital competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the city's highest ranking in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's according to the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking compiled by the Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institute said Hong Kong had advanced three places following an improvement in three areas - technology, knowledge and future readiness.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that employee training in the city demonstrated a significant enhancement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said the result recognised Hong Kong's status as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to collaborate with various sectors of society to further enhance Hong Kong's I&T ecosystem, thereby upholding our competitive edge in the global market and injecting new impetus to economic development," a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore claimed top spot in the ranking, followed by Switzerland and Denmark.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several airlines resumed flights to Bali on Thursday, after cancelling trips to and from the Indonesian resort island due to huge eruptions at a nearby volcano.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eighty-three international routes were cancelled on Wednesday, the general manager of Bali's international airport said in a statement, after Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki spewed a nine-kilometre tower of ash into the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcano has erupted more than a dozen times over the last two weeks, killing at least nine people and forcing the evacuation of thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qantas and Jetstar resumed their services to Bali, Australia's Qantas Group said in a statement on Thursday, noting "improved" conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to monitor the changing conditions and volcanic activity," it said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday morning, Bali's airport had recorded another 32 international flight cancellations while 180 international flights were scheduled, the airport's general manager Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that volcanic ash from Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki had been heading away from the airport since Wednesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope affected airline passengers can resume their travel on Thursday," Ahmad said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewotobi erupted again overnight into Thursday morning, and a thick ash column and lava flows could be seen pouring from its crater, according to authorities. (AFP)

    Toraji not as bad as expected, say commuters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Toraji left Hong Kong relatively unscathed, with commuters saying the storm was not as bad as they expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  At Admiralty Station many people were making their way to work as the observatory downgraded the T8 signal to T3 at 10.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hotel worker Jana said getting to work wasn't a hassle, but she thinks the T3 announcement could have come earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not good. So everybody needs to be fast. We're going to work and [hurrying] to get ready... it's not good," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason, who was waiting for a taxi at Kowloon Tong Station, shared her sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s not really a big issue but there needs to be more transportation options to help people get to work immediately. I think transportation should resume to normality a little before the signal is lowered," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter, a barrister, said taxi drivers were jacking up fares during the storm so he had to take the MTR instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The taxis are playing the usual game. I live in Sheung Wan. I got into a cab, wanted to go to Bank of China Tower. Once I was in, he said, oh, that'll be 100 dollars. Well, it's a scam," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MTR is always operating, unless it's a direct hit when everything shuts down. I've lived in Hong Kong for so long, it's just part of the summer or late summer, isn't it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Maeva, who was getting breakfast before a job interview, said transport was smooth but many shops were still closed because of the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here to do some shopping but everything is closed, because of the storm. It's less [smooth] than usual but still. I think it was rainy and windy but not that bad," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some tourists told RTHK that it didn't feel like a T8 at all and they were eager to explore the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not affected in anyway. I feel relatively safe. I am looking forward to travelling around here," said a US visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a tourist from Russia, Vladislav, said he had to start his activities for the day a little later than planned because most stores were closed in Kowloon Tong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the T3 signal in place of T8 at 10.20am on Thursday as Hong Kong gradually returns to normalcy with the departure of Tropical Storm Toraji.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T8 had been up for more than 11 hours, with the SAR largely unscathed as the storm skirted around 130km south of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters said the T3 would remain in force for most of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm led to the cancellation of 10 flights, with 20 others delayed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the airport would operate as normal for the day and should be able to handle more than 1,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other modes of public transport would also gradually get back to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation and bus companies said most services have gradually resumed to normal frequencies as T3 replaced T8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses to the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau would return to full operations from 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, ferry services between Discovery Bay and Central would also resume from 10.40am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Ferry said outlying island ferry services would resume from 11.30am, while Star Ferry said its cross-harbour services between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as well as Wan Chai would resume at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority said public out-patient and specialist out-patient clinics as well as day services would gradually resume within two hours after T8 was replaced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority also said patients whose appointments were affected by the storm, and who made their bookings through the phone or the mobile app, HA Go, could make a new appointment from 11.20am.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time during a T8, the stock market stayed open under a new arrangement introduced in September to keep trading going despite adverse weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourist spots would also reopen gradually. Hong Kong Disneyland said it would provide limited services from 11.30am, while Ocean Park would do the same from noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District would reopen at 1pm, and tickets to M+ and the Hong Kong Palace Museum were extended for 60 days.

 Trading in Hong Kong financial markets opened as usual on Thursday morning despite the T8 typhoon signal - the first time since authorities scrapped trading suspension under severe weather in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing said securities and derivatives markets will remain fully operational.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index opened down 197 points, or 0.99 percent, at 19,626 on Thursday.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau is on a mission in Lima as he seeks cooperation and investment opportunities with other economies in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or Apec.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his first full day in the Peruvian capital, Yau held bilateral meetings with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts on the sidelines of the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He first met Thai commerce minister Pichai Naripthaphan. The pair exchanged pleasantries in basic Cantonese, before sitting down for a formal dialogue behind closed doors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR commerce chief then held similar exchanges with Budi Santoso, the Indonesian minister of trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau briefed the Southeast Asian delegations about the latest development in Hong Kong, and explored potential cooperation opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed gratitude to both Thailand and Indonesia for their support regarding the SAR’s accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) said it will downgrade the T8 storm signal to T3 at 10.20am – in time for students of afternoon primary and secondary schools to go back to class.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said winds are expected to weaken as Tropical Storm Toraji slowly moves away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Toraji is now closest to the territory,” the HKO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderat gradually during the day today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night. However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at a public hospital during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes will resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning were also adjourned, while afternoon hearings will be held as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies. It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Thursday said it would consider downgrading the T8 storm signal between 10am and noon, as Tropical Storm Toraji starts slowly moving away after coming within 130 kilometres of the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wind gusts in excess of 80 kilometres per hour were recorded at Waglan Island and Tate’s Cairn as the storm inched its way past Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a 6am briefing, Senior Scientific Officer Yeung Kwok-chung of the Observatory said Toraji was at that point the closest it would come to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji is expected to weaken and move away from Hong Kong, and local winds will moderate gradually during the day today. Depending on the weakening of local winds, the Observatory will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 between 10am and 12 noon,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters are nonetheless expecting occasional squally showers on Thursday. They also urged people to stay away from the shoreline, as seas are very rough with swells.
  <br>
  <br>
  The T8 signal was issued at 11.10pm on Wednesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the storm didn’t have any major impact on the city, with authorities receiving three reports of fallen trees as of 6am, with no reports of landslides or flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department at a public hospital during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most students will get a day off, with morning and whole-day classes cancelled for the day. However, afternoon and evening classes would resume if the T8 signal is downgraded before 10.30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many public services, including outpatient services at hospitals and social welfare care centres will be suspended during the storm’s passage. All court hearings in the morning are also adjourned, and afternoon hearings will also be put off if the T8 warning is still up as of 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the MTR Corporation said it would continue providing rail services – albeit at limited frequencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on most lines would run at 10-minute intervals, while there would be 15 minutes between trains operating between Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park, and a 20-minute gap on the Disneyland Resort line, as well as for East Rail trains running between Admiralty and Lok Ma Chau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rail services would run at intervals of between 15 and 20 minutes during the T8 signal.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have sought shelter at 27 temporary shelters opened in various districts by the Home Affairs Department.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks were little-changed on Wednesday, as traders digested fresh data pointing to a small and widely expected rise in inflation last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.1 percent to 43,958, while the S&P 500 rose by less than 0.1 percent to 5,985.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 19,230.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been some concern ahead of Wednesday's CPI report that it could be hotter than expected, said B Riley Wealth Management chief market strategist Art Hogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the end, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.6 percent in the 12 months to October, in line with economists' expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers in large part are the fact that the CPI came in very much in line with expectations, and some buzz in the markets yesterday," he said. "So that coming in line was very much a positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, the chip designer AMD fell more than 3.0 percent as the company announced it was laying off around four percent of its employees. (AFP)

    Harvey wins Booker Prize for space story 'Orbital'

<img alt='"Orbital" tracks astronauts from five countries as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778941_1_20241113213850.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Samantha Harvey won the 2024 Booker Prize for her novel 'Orbital', a story about a single day aboard the International Space Station that ponders the beauty and fragility of Earth.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Orbital" tracks astronauts from Japan, Russia, the United States, Britain and Italy as they observe and reflect on their home planet, touching on themes of mourning, desire and the climate crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the 49-year-old Harvey's fifth novel, and was the top selling book on the shortlist of six finalists, having sold more copies than the past three Booker Prize winners combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges of the prize, which is now in its 55th year, praised her writing for the "intensity of attention to the precious and precarious world".
  <br>
  <br>
  Past winners of the prestigious Booker, which is open to works of fiction written in English, include Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Yann Martel, Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes and Kazuo Ishiguro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey said she wrote the novel while stuck at home during the pandemic watching the space station's live camera. She likened the experience of her six characters "trapped in a tin can" to that of lockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set over 24 hours, the astronauts and cosmonauts of her story witness sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets as they circle the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “To look at the Earth from space is like a child looking into a mirror and realizing for the first time that the person in the mirror is herself," said Harvey. "What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the novel “is not exactly about climate change, but implied in the view of the Earth is the fact of human-made climate change”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her acceptance speech, Harvey dedicated the prize to "everybody who does speak for and not against the Earth; for and not against the dignity of other humans, other life; and all the humans who speak for and call for and work for peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  Writer and artist Edmund de Waal, who chaired the five-member judging panel, praised the “crystalline” writing and “capaciousness” of Harvey’s succinct novel - at 136 pages in its UK paperback edition, one of the shortest-ever Booker winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a book that repays slow reading,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the judges spent a full day picking their winner and came to a unanimous conclusion. Harvey beat five other finalists from Canada, the United States, Australia and the Netherlands, chosen from among 156 novels submitted by publishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harvey walks away with a 50,000 pound prize which she said she would disburse “some of it on tax. I want to buy a new bike. And then the rest, I want to go to Japan”. (Agencies)

    China hawk Rubio gets Trump nod for secretary of state

<img alt="Marco Rubio, Trump's pick as secretary of state, has been sanctioned twice by China. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779000_1_20241114045203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he is nominating Republican Senator and noted China hawk Marco Rubio to be his secretary of state, as he quickly fills out his cabinet ahead of his January 20 inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who clashed bitterly with Rubio for the presidential nomination in 2016, said in a statement nominating him: "Marco is a Highly Respected Leader, and a very powerful Voice for Freedom."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio said in a statement that he will work with Trump "every day to carry out his foreign policy agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the leadership of President Trump, we will deliver peace through strength and always put the interests of Americans and America above all else," Rubio said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants to Miami and vociferous opponent of Latin American communists, China and Iran, would be the first Hispanic as the top US diplomat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 to sanction SAR and central government officials, and has in turn been sanctioned by Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio was among a flurry of new nominations announced by Trump. He also tabbed Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, and former Democratic representative Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength," Trump said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also extolled Gaetz, a staunch ally who has defended Trump in his legal battles and impeachment fights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System," Trump posted on social media. "Matt will end Weaponized Government... and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department."
  <br>
  <br>
  As attorney general, Gaetz would drive all aspects of the work of the US Justice Department, which for years has carried out an investigation into sex trafficking and obstruction of justice allegations involving him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaetz, who denies all wrongdoing, was told last year that there would be no charges against him, but he remains the subject of a House ethics investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican and Democratic senators immediately voiced doubts that Gaetz's nomination would survive the confirmation process, which can involve intense questioning during difficult, fraught hearings. (Agencies)

    Republicans complete takeover with House majority

<img alt="CNN and NBC projected that the Republicans have retained their majority in the House of Representatives. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778993_1_20241114040243.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Republican Party has won a majority in the US House of Representatives, American media projected on Wednesday, completing their clean sweep of Congress and handing President-elect Donald Trump vast legislative power.
 <br>
  <br>
  After more than a week of vote counting, CNN and NBC projected that the Republicans had reached the 218 seats needed to retain their majority in the 435-seat lower chamber, having already secured control over the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a beautiful morning in Washington. It is a new day in America," said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who held a press conference to celebrate victory before the result was official.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sun is shining, and that's a reflection about how we all feel. This is a very, very important moment for the country and we do not take it lightly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump triumphed in each of the seven battleground states in the November 5 presidential election and also won the national popular vote, with preliminary figures showing him ahead of Democratic Party challenger Kamala Harris by 3.2 million votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having control of both chambers of Congress will clear the way for him to confirm his nominations for key positions in his administration and will also allow him to push through his radical agenda of mass deportations, tax cuts and slashing regulations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traditional values of family and loyalty are vital for not just many Chinese families, but also overseas Chinese businesses seeking to win the hearts of the people in Peru, the host of this year’s Apec summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation, which is welcoming global leaders to its capital Lima this week, does most of its trade with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is home to around 170 Chinese enterprises, many of which heeded the call by the central government to look for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Chinese presence in Peru dates back to the 19th century. Chinese food is extremely popular in the country, with thousands of Chifas, or restaurants which serve mostly Cantonese dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The term Chifa is believed to have come from the Chinese words “eat rice”, meaning to have a meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from the catering industry, Chinese immigrants also thrive in other sectors, especially manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  That includes Alfredo Chang, who oversees the Calimod group, one of the most recognised footwear brands in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Employing over 600 locals, Chang runs a vast business and knows the production chain inside and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secret to success, he says, is to treat employees like family and gain their loyalty, both of which are traditional Chinese values.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our company culture is that if we treat the workers well, the workers will treat the company well too,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang recalled the difficult times during Covid, when he refused to send workers on no-pay leave even after the government granted employers the right to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had to take out bank loans to tide over the crisis. The bold move has won the hearts of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a result, many employees would turn down offers from other companies, and say, ‘I’m not leaving. This place is like family to me.’ Our company culture is that we are all a family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His son, Thomas, has plans to expand the business to nearby regions such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hopes the Chankay megaport, which is majority owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, can bring down the cost of raw materials imported from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the biggest opportunity for Peru is to really become a hub for South America. Right now with the Chankay port, the lead time from Shanghai to Peru is around 20 days. It's almost half of what is right now, and Chankay is going to be the biggest port on the [South American] Pacific,” he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The freight will be much cheaper, so that will help us probably be more competitive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added South American neighbours such as Brazil should utilise the port and fast-track their shipments to China.

    Xi to hold final talks with Biden in Peru: US official

<img alt="Saturday's talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in Peru is expected to the last between the world leaders. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778981_1_20241114021104.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping will reportedly be holding talks with his US counterpart Joe Biden on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru, in what’s expected to be their last official talks before Donald Trump takes office.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior Biden administration official briefed reporters about the meeting on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect this will be their last meeting as presidents," the official said. "With that in mind, we expect the president will use the opportunity to take stock of efforts to responsibly manage competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already signaled a confrontational approach with Beijing for his second term, picking a number of outspoken China hawks for key foreign and defense positions in his top team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has also promised to slap 60-percent tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to fears of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration official would not be drawn on whether he would try to advise China on how to deal with Trump – or if he would advise Trump on how to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult, complicated, consequential relationship," the official said. "The president has been pretty clear that he even admits the competitive aspects of the relationship, we need to find ways to manage it responsibly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden heads to Lima on Thursday for the APEC summit on Friday and Saturday for his swansong at the major gathering of Asia-Pacific economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks will be the third meeting between Biden and Xi during Biden's presidency. They met in Woodside, California, last November on the sidelines of the 2023 Apec summit, and the leaders last spoke by phone in April. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin broke through the US$90,000 level on Wednesday, as its rally showed no signs of easing on expectations that Donald Trump as US president will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has become one of the most eye-catching movers in the week since the election and on Wednesday touched record highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s value has rocketed up 32 percent since the November 5 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller peer ether has risen 37 percent since election day, while dogecoin, an alternative, volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk was up more than 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear how or when that could happen but the possibility drove a speculative surge in crypto mining and trading stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Key areas to monitor include potential regulatory changes, increased institutional participation, and a rise in M&A activity," said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new political landscape may bring clearer regulations for crypto assets and could prompt strategic developments, such as a national bitcoin reserve and growth in the mining sector." (Reuters)
