    Govt won't rely on land sales for revenue: FS

<img alt="Paul Chan said the government hopes that different sources of revenue, besides land sales, can become more important." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793467_1_20250227134032.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday that the government no longer wants to rely heavily on land sales as a main source of revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the comment when lawmaker Chow Man-kwong asked him whether officials can come up with measures to boost the market so that it isn't "overly cold".
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the new budget, Chan said officials hope that homes will be more affordable for the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, land sales were one of the main sources of government revenue that supported other kinds of development. This led to a surge in property prices because of a lack of supply," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We no longer want to see the SAR over-rely on land sales revenue. We need to develop the economy so that salaries and profits taxes and other forms of revenue are more important."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Dominic Lee asked whether the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, previously known as Lantau Tomorrow Vision, is "dead", being as there is no mention of it in the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are prioritising the Northern Metropolis project, while stressing that ongoing studies relating to the artificial islands will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to focus on the Northern Metropolis, putting in every effort to speed up that project. Lantau Tomorrow is ranked behind the metropolis for sure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, said businesspeople he has spoken to think the proposed HK$200 airport departure tax is too expensive, saying flight tickets to some nearby cities only cost that much.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam was also among several councillors who questioned whether a land departure tax for private cars is necessary, arguing that it would go against the desire for Hong Kong to integrate further with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the HK$80 increase in the airport departure tax is only minor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said transport officials have received various feedback on the land departure tax, and the government does not have a finalised plan at this moment.

    HKU and CUHK to get 60 more medical training places

<img alt="CUHK says it will announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course. Photo courtesy of CUHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793464_1_20250227125822.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau said that medical schools at Chinese University (CUHK) and the University of Hong Kong (HKU) would have 60 more training places in the next academic year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the bureau said 50 places would be reserved for CUHK and HKU to introduce a new entry track for bachelor’s degree holders who want to pursue medicine as their second degree.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the remaining 10 places would be allocated to the universities’ existing medicine programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document also stated the number of first-year undergraduates for the eight publicly-funded universities would remain at 15,000 for each year in the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from RTHK, CUHK said it would announce details for the “second degree entry track” in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget address on Wednesday that the number of medical training places would increase to 650 in total in the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam said the increase was in line with his expectations, noting it was part of the bureau's ongoing plan to raise medical student intake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said while there was a need for more doctors in view of an ageing population, medical schools cannot increase the number of training places drastically in the short run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to step up the teaching facilities in the universities and maintain a good number of teaching staff. Students also have to learn the clinical skills at the bedside on patients, which means we need enough hospitals to teach our students, and we need enough doctors, clinicians to mentor our students," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these takes time to prepare. That's why the increase has to be gradual."

    FS shoots down levy for all outbound travellers
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793462_2_20250227135507.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said a proposed levy on private cars departing Hong Kong is aimed at clawing back government spending on cross-boundary facilities, while dismissing the idea of a fee for all outbound travellers over the potential impact on the public.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a radio phone-in programme, Chan fielded questions from callers on a wide range of cost-cutting measures detailed in his budget, including tweaks to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the over 60s and the phasing-out of a HK$2,500 student grant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A caller surnamed Wong said he was confused about the plan to charge private car drivers HK$200 to cross the border, a move the government says should raise about HK$1 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What kind of private cars will be levied? If you’re talking about cross-boundary vehicles with closed road permits, usually they have companies set up on the mainland and travel for business purposes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you wish to boost revenue, why not tax travellers who leave the city via land border control points?"
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Chan said quite a lot of money has been spent on cross-boundary facilities, including the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can we recover some of those costs? That is one of our considerations. Currently we're still in the research stage, and everyone can give their views so the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau will consider them," he replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for a departure tax for all travellers at land crossings, Chan said such a move would have quite a large impact on the general public, and this should be "avoided as much as possible".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another caller was upset with the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant, which has been given out annually to the parents of children in kindergartens and primary or secondary schools since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Didn't the government tell people to have more children? You cancelled this subsidy, but at the same time provide half a month of extra payment to recipients of social security and Old Age Allowance … What are the middle class like us supposed to do?” asked a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief acknowledged her concerns, but stressed that public resources should go to those most in need.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, this HK$2,500 does not require any means test and everyone is eligible … so we think if we were to cut down on expenditure, it has to come from these areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, proposed tweaks to the HK$2 transport scheme for the over 60s also drew a lot of feedback.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Why cap the number of trips at 240 per month, instead of raising the concessionary fare to HK$3 or HK$4?" asked a man surnamed Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the FS said he wanted to keep the cheapest discounted fares at HK$2 because the scheme is widely recognised by society and encourages the elderly to go out more often.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But by capping the number of trips at 240 [per month], we can limit the future expenditure growth. In the short term, we can even save money when the adjustments are implemented in 2027 or 2028," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Michelle Trachtenberg, a former child star who appeared in the 1996 “Harriet the Spy” hit movie and went on to co-star in two buzzy millennial-era TV shows — “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Gossip Girl” — has died. She was 39.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police responded to a 911 call shortly after 8am at a 51-storey luxury apartment tower in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood where officers found Trachtenberg "unconscious and unresponsive,” according to an NYPD statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  No foul play was suspected and the New York Medical Examiner is investigating the cause of death, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The family requests privacy for their loss," Trachtenberg's representative, Gary Mantoosh, said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trachtenberg was eight when she began playing Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon’s “The Adventures of Pete & Pete” from 1994 to 1996 and then starred in the title role in the film adaptations of “Harriet the Spy” and “Inspector Gadget,” opposite Matthew Broderick.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Michelle comes off as genuine because she really is a genuine kid. Everyone can identify with her,” said Debby Beece, president of Nickelodeon Movies in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2000 Trachtenberg joined the cast of “Buffy,” playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar between 2000 and 2003. (AP)

 An Executive Councillor on Thursday said most of Hong Kong's senior citizens will not be affected by changes to the city's fare concessionary scheme for the over 60s.
 <br>
  <br>
  As announced in Wednesday's budget, instead of a flat fare of HK$2, eligible commuters will have to pay 20 percent of any standard fare exceeding HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme will also be capped at 240 trips per month, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.

  Lam Ching-choi, who formerly chaired the Elderly Commission, was speaking to RTHK.

  “Only a small percentage of them, they might travel quite a lot because actually, we set the limit quite liberally, I don't think it will affect most individuals who are just trying to visit their grandchildren, or going to work" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On average, I believe 99 percent of individuals won't exceed the limit", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said this fine-tuned proposal preserves the government's policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to beneficiaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sailing industry on Thursday said they welcomed Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s plan to build a new waterfront landmark in Hung Hom, with a yacht club mooted there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his budget speech the day before, Chan said the MTR Corporation has been asked to conduct a study to develop an area south of Hung Hom Station, as well as nearby pier sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is definitely good news to promote yachting and yachting tourism in Hong Kong," the Commodore of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club Adrian Pang told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said that currently, Hong Kong lacks berths and moorings for boats that want to visit the SAR, adding that authorities can do more to provide land for yachting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out the city’s geography means there is a lot of potential in developing the sailing industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at Hong Kong, we are unique in a sense that if you look at the Greater Bay Area, we have the most beautiful coastline, we have all the ecoparks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities want the Hung Hom landmark to also include "iconic commercial and residential developments, retail, dining and entertainment facilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I welcome the government to do more studies and hopefully we can develop more sites," Pang added.

<img alt="Afghanistan's Azmatullah Omarzai, left, celebrates with teammate Ibrahim Zadran after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793419_1_20250227081610.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Ibrahim Zadran's 177 and five wickets by Azmatullah Omarzai helped Afghanistan knock England out of the Champions Trophy with a thrilling eight-run victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan posted 325-7 in a virtual knockout tie in Lahore and then bowled out England for 317 in 49.5 overs to stay alive in the race for a semi-final place while England have no chance of reaching the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joe Root's 120 went in vain as England lost regular wickets to lose their second straight ODI to the Afghans after their shock defeat in the 2023 World Cup in India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing 13 off the last six balls with one wicket in hand, pace bowler Omarzai kept calm to give away just four runs and dismiss Adil Rashid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Playing under the cloud of boycott calls from some British politicians over the plight of women in the Taliban-ruled nation, Afghanistan elected to bat in a bid to bounce back from their opening loss to South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they soon slipped to 37-3 inside nine overs before Zadran pulled the innings together with a fourth-wicket partnership of 103 with skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who made 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zadran, 23, later added 111 for the sixth wicket with Mohammad Nabi, who hit 40 in 24 balls. He took the England bowling apart and went past his previous ODI best of 162 in his 146-ball knock laced with 12 fours and six sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He not only broke his own record for Afghanistan's highest individual ODI score but also a tournament record, days after Ben Duckett's 165 in England's opening loss to Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it was one of the best ODI innings I have ever seen," said Shahidi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Wood's injury in the middle of his fourth over hampered England as the fast bowler managed just eight overs and went off with a knee issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, England lost two early wickets to be 30-2 after senior spinner Mohammad Nabi struck with his first ball to send back Jamie Smith for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duckett attempted to hit back in a 68-run stand with Root to steady the chase but Rashid Khan trapped the left-handed opener lbw for 38.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Brook looked fluent in his 25 but fell caught and bowled to Nabi in a soft dismissal to further put England in trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Root kept calm and along with skipper Jos Buttler, who took time to settle before hitting two sixes, put on 83 runs to keep the chase going.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan bowlers kept up the pressure with dot balls and Omarzai got the skipper out for 38 off a top edge caught at deep square-leg and Liam Livingstone departed soon after.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Root hung on as he reached his first ODI ton in almost five years and 37 innings and with Jamie Overton kept chipping away with regular boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Omarzai got the prized wicket as he had Root caught behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He played an unbelievable innings tonight. The way to handle pressure in a run-chase," said Buttler. "He needed one of the other top six batters to stay in with him and take the game deeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pendulum kept swinging as Omarzai dismissed Overton but despite Jofra Archer's late push England went down as the third team to be eliminated in the eight-nation tournament after hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh. (AFP)

    EU was born to 'screw' US, Trump says

<img alt="US President Donald Trump hosts his first cabinet meeting with Elon Musk in attendance, Washington DC. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793415_1_20250227075523.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the European Union was born to "screw" the United States, laying bare his hostility to the longtime US partner as he detailed new tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's month back in the White House has been marked by soaring friction between Washington and its European allies, with the United States abruptly shifting gears on support for Ukraine and Germany's likely next leader urging Europe to seek take greater control of its own defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Look, let's be honest, the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States," Trump told reporters as he gathered his cabinet for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it. But now I'm president," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission shot back that the European Union is "the world's largest free market" and has been "a boon for the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt, writing on X, said Trump had a "seriously distorted view of history" as the EU was "actually set up to prevent war on the European continent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said at his cabinet meeting that the European Union has "really taken advantage of us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had a trade deficit to the 27-nation bloc of $235.6 billion last year, according to official US figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if he had made a decision on tariff levels for the European Union, Trump added: "We'll be announcing it very soon and it'll be 25 percent, generally speaking."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that cars would be among the products to be hit, grim news for Germany whose export-driven economy has been in a slump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission warned it would respond "firmly and immediately" to new tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, while speaking to reporters during the meeting, Trump said he has a "very good" relationship with President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a great relationship with President Xi. We want them to come in and invest. I see so many things saying that we don't want China in this country. That's not right. We want them to invest in the United States," said Trump. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved a giant step closer to the Premier League title with a ruthless 2-0 win against Newcastle, while Arsenal's challenge was left in tatters after a 0-0 draw against Nottingham Forest.
 <br>
  <br>
  With suspended boss Arne Slot watching from the Anfield stands, Liverpool opened up a massive 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal thanks to goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's other action, Manchester City won 1-0 at Tottenham, while 10-man Manchester United held on to beat lowly Ipswich 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is Liverpool who continue to hog the Premier League spotlight as an almost-flawless campaign approaches a memorable climax.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds look certain to win the Premier League for the first time since 2020, which will move them level with Manchester United on a record-equalling 20 English titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having won 2-0 at fading champions City on Sunday 24 hours after Arsenal lost to West Ham, Slot's men kept their foot on the gas to turn the title race into a procession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szoboszlai netted with a clinical finish in the 11th minute and Mac Allister's fine strike in the 63rd minute made it 20 wins and just one defeat from 28 league games this term.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, Slot has made an astonishing impact, which could yet include Champions League and League Cup glory as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds play Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 first leg next week and face a rematch with Newcastle at Wembley in the League Cup final on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said his side would concede the title "over my dead body".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have a game in hand on Liverpool, but Arteta may have to accept the stalemate at the City Ground was the final nail in the coffin for Arsenal's attempt to win a first title since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  The toothless Gunners, playing without a recognised striker, managed just one shot on target at the City Ground, with Riccardo Calafiori hitting the post in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-placed Forest's surprise challenge for Champions League qualification has also hit the rocks after just one win from their last five matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Erling Haaland returned from injury to clinch Manchester City's victory at Tottenham as the troubled champions moved into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had missed City's previous two defeats against Real Madrid and Liverpool with a knee injury suffered against Newcastle on February 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norway star showed no rust with the first-half winner in north London as City climbed one point above fifth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Haaland's 28th goal in all competitions this season, with 10 of those coming in his last 11 games to silence the critics after a barren spell earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  After four defeats in their last six games in all competitions, this was a much-needed victory for City, who started strongly but rode their luck as Tottenham missed a series of second-half chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Harry Maguire's header earned Manchester United a hard-fought win at Old Trafford, easing Patrick Dorgu's embarrassment after his part in a calamitous Ipswich opener was compounded by a first-half red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maguire's second-half header ended United's three-match winless run in the league and lifted a little of the gloom after Monday's announcement of a second round of redundancies at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim secured just his fifth league win as United boss despite a disastrous mix up between Dorgu and keeper Andre Onana that gifted Jaden Philogene an early goal. (AFP)

 Gains in Nvidia ahead of earnings helped lift the Nasdaq on Wednesday while the Dow retreated on White House talk of more tariffs, this time on the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia jumped 3.7 percent ahead of its keenly anticipated earnings report, viewed as a key proxy for the artificial intelligence industry, which has under-performed other sectors so far in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been under pressure in recent days due to lackluster US economic data and worries about Donald Trump's policies. During a cabinet meeting, the US president said he expects 25 percent tariffs on the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.4 percent at 43,433.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 was flat at 5,956, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 percent to 19,075.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is a reflection of how people view the new administration and the uncertainty of its policies," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, General Motors jumped 3.8 percent after unveiling a new US$6 billion share repurchase authorisation and lifting its quarterly divided by three cents a share.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eli Lilly gained 1.5 percent after announcing it will build four additional new manufacturing sites in the United States in a commitment aimed at influencing upcoming Trump administration decisions on trade and other issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shares of BP fell 1.7 percent as it announced a major retreat from renewable energy in a pivot back to petroleum investments. (AFP)

<img alt="Palestinians sit next to a fire among the rubble of destroyed buildings, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, at Jabalia refugee camp, northern Gaza.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's official social media accounts posted an apparently AI-generated video depicting war-ravaged Gaza rebuilt into a seaside resort, replete with a towering golden statue of himself.
 <br>
  <br>
  The video, which racked up more than 29 million views on Instagram and was shared thousands of times on Trump's Truth Social network by Wednesday afternoon, prompted some commenters to question whether the president's accounts had been hacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-second clip remained on Trump's accounts without denial or retraction hours after the initial posting on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video "Gaza 2025 What's Next?" opens with people on a rubble-strewn street emerging from a tunnel onto a beach with palm trees and yachts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has floated the idea of a US takeover of Gaza under which its Palestinian population would be relocated, a proposal met with global condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later appeared to soften his plan, saying he was only recommending the idea, and conceding that the leaders of Jordan and Egypt, the proposed destinations for relocated Gazans, had rejected any effort to move Palestinians against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the social media clip, the soundtrack includes lyrics such as "Donald's coming to set you free, bringing the light for all to see", and "Feast and dance, the deal is done, Trump Gaza number one".
  <br>
  <br>
  Seemingly AI-generated renditions of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sip cocktails in swimsuits by a pool, while other shots show what appears to be Elon Musk dancing under a shower of cash on the beach.
  <br>
  <br>
  A larger-than-life golden statue of Trump is also featured.
  <br>
  <br>
  One scene closely resembles an AI-generated image of Trump and Netanyahu drinking cocktails that began circulating in early February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senir Hamas official Bassem Naim said in reaction to the video: "Unfortunately, President Trump is once again proposing ideas and solutions that do not take into account the cultures and interests of the indigenous population."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Gaza, people who watched the video were in disbelief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This video of Trump is full of fallacies and shows a lack of cultural awareness... Gaza won't become a tourist spot like Italy or Spain," said Nasser Abu Hadaid, a 60-year-old resident of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas will hand over the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday in what it said would be an exchange for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, capping the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States said talks were on track for a second phase of the ceasefire deal that has largely held but whose complexity and long-drawn-out implementation have highlighted its fragility.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel on Wednesday, thousands of mourners gathered for the funeral of Shiri Bibas and her sons, who had died in captivity in Gaza and had become symbols of the country's hostage ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has largely halted the Israel-Hamas war sparked by the October 7, 2023 attack, and has seen 25 hostages released alive so far in exchange for hundreds of prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas and other resistance factions will hand over four bodies of Israeli captives," said a Hamas official, adding that in return, Israel would free 625 Palestinian prisoners in an exchange beginning on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has reached an agreement with mediators for the return of the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Washington, US President Donald Trump's top envoy on the Middle East said Israeli representatives were en route to talks on the next phase of the ceasefire deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're making a lot of progress. Israel is sending a team right now as we speak," Steve Witkoff told an event for the American Jewish Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's either going to be in Doha or in Cairo, where negotiations will begin again with the Egyptians and the Qataris," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This first phase is supposed to end on Saturday, but negotiations for the next stage – which were due to begin in early February – have not yet started.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it is ready to release all the remaining hostages "in one go" during the second phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the group accused Israel of endangering the Gaza truce by delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had concerns over how the hostages have been freed, with Netanyahu describing the handovers as "humiliating ceremonies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has yet to comment on whether it will release the Palestinian prisoners on Thursday. (AFP)

    Universities 'fully prepared' for funding cut

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several public universities on Wednesday said they understood the public finance challenges faced by the government, and are fully prepared for a funding cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows Financial Secretary Paul Chan's announcement in his budget speech that publicly-financed universities will see funding slashed by two percent. The reduction will be compounded over three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the move will result in savings of HK$2.8 billion between 2025-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  The University Grants Committee also revealed in a subsequent statement that universities need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the development, Chinese University said it understood the need for all sectors to work together during tough times, adding that it will carefully study the potential impact on its operations, and minimise disruption to teaching and research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was shared by City University, which said in a statement that it will actively explore diverse income sources and seek additional research funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polytechnic University also echoed the views, saying it will find ways to optimise its fiscal resources by controlling its expenditure and increasing revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the University of Hong Kong said it'll work through tough times as part of the society, but hoped the administration will review university funding policies when the economy gradually recovers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 About 100 Chinese nationals who engaged in illegal offshore gambling operations in the Philippines have been repatriated to the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Wednesday said law enforcement agencies of the two countries had joined hands to crack down on Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government is committed to cracking down on gambling and relevant crimes and always asks overseas Chinese nationals to strictly abide by local laws and regulations and do not engage in any illegal and criminal activities," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the Philippines to completely eradicate the scourge inflicted by offshore gambling as soon as possible. China will continue to work with the Philippines to jointly combat crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines announced a ban on POGOs in July last year, and the operation marked another step towards that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The online gambling industry emerged in the Philippines in 2016, and expanded rapidly as operators leveraged the country's liberal gambling laws to target Chinese customers. Gambling is illegal in China. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Liverpool's Slot gets two-match ban over derby chaos

<img alt="Arne Slot gets his marching orders from referee Michael Oliver. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793366_1_20250226204458.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool manager Arne Slot will not be on the touchline for Wednesday's home match against Newcastle after he was handed a two-match ban and given a hefty fine for his behaviour in the Merseyside derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Tarkowski's equaliser for Everton deep into stoppage time in the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park on February 12 provoked chaotic scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff were sent off by referee Michael Oliver, along with Liverpool's Curtis Jones and Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA issued a statement on Wednesday saying an independent regulatory commission had sanctioned Everton, Liverpool, Slot and Hulshoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was alleged that the Liverpool head coach acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards both the match referee and an assistant referee after the match had finished," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arne Slot admitted the charge, and the Regulatory Commission imposed a two-match touchline suspension and £70,000 (US$89,000) fine."
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, Everton have been fined £65,000 and Liverpool £50,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot and Hulshoff were both dismissed after approaching Oliver following the final whistle. Speaking about the incident at a press conference two days later, Slot admitted his emotions had got the better of him and he had "made the wrong decision."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I should have acted differently after the game, but it's an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that's definitely what I did," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Doucoure clashed after the Everton player celebrated in front of the Liverpool fans, leading Jones to confront him before players and staff from both sides raced over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot will be in the stands for Wednesday's game against Newcastle and the ban also covers Liverpool's home fixture against Southampton on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban is for domestic games only, meaning he will be allowed in the technical area when Liverpool visit Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on March 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also be on the touchline for Liverpool's League Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League leaders Liverpool are 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal at the top of the table and are hot favourites to lift a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title. (AFP)

    Commercial land sale pause draws mixed views

<img alt="The vacancy rate for Hong Kong's prime office space reached a historic high of 17 percent in January, according to property consultancy Colliers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793353_2_20250226195707.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s move to pause the sale of commercial land in the upcoming fiscal year has drawn mixed views from analysts – some say it will ease a supply glut of office space while others felt it will have limited impact to the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."

<img alt="Ho Lok-sang says the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs, but that the cap won't offer a major boost to the public coffers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793286_1_20250226145154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economics professor on Wednesday said he supports proposed changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme but questioned whether capping the number of journeys would offer a significant boost to the public coffers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 240 monthly maximum number of trips mentioned by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget works out at around eight per day on average in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, adjunct professor of Lingnan University’s Department of Economics, said the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also said very few over 60s make that many journeys, so the move won't save much for the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don't think capping the number of trips for the elderly makes sense. It's not going to make much effect on the revenue anyway because there are relatively few people who will travel so many times,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think there's really no point in making that kind of provision, because it makes people feel bad and it also tarnishes the government's image in terms of caring for the benefit of the well-being of the elderly.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that a small number of people could be affected by the cap, such as those who need to make a lot of transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she welcomes the changes to the fare scheme, which include offering an 80 percent discount for journeys that cost regular passengers more than HK$10, rather than the current HK$2 flat rate subsidised trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government measures introduced to make it sustainable are fairly moderate," said Ip, who's also convenor of the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(There is) no impact on the qualifying age of those benefiting from this concession, but it would help to solve the problem of paying very little fare for very long journeys."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB party vice-chairman Holden Chow also supports the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the scheme unveiled by the (financial secretary) today is acceptable. It strikes a balance between the [need for] financial sustainability, but at the same time, will look after the needs of the elderly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The people who live further away from the city centre, including people in Tuen Mun or Tung Chung, they may actually be affected. I think going forward, we will try to explore with the government and see whether there's anything we could do to alleviate the pain of these people."

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said he hopes the public understand that everyone has to play their part when it comes to the city's "belt-tightening", given the tough financial situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said his budget puts forward a "reinforced version" of the fiscal consolidation programme, which includes a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, he said the government is moving in the right direction to achieve a fiscal balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, we try our best to diversify and grow our economy, but at the same time it is a belt-tightening budget, so everybody in the community would need to contribute to this effort," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to do the best we can in minimising the impact on our people, but at the same time, unavoidably, everyone has to chip in a little bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government has no plans at present to introduce any new taxes, such as a goods and services tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to pay regard to the following considerations. One is the competitiveness of Hong Kong, in terms of attracting investment and talent. Secondly, if we are to increase revenue, we try to minimise the impact on the average citizen," Chan said.

    University funding cuts 'acceptable': lawmaker

<img alt="Universities will have to return HK$4 billion from their reserves to the government. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793324_1_20250226165659.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and Lingnan University's associate vice president Lau Chi-pang on Wednesday said he believed universities could cope with the proposed funding cuts which he described as "mild and acceptable".
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he would set aside HK$68.1 billion for government-funded universities over the next three years, which reflect a two percent reduction each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the funding cut could save around HK$2.8 billion for the 2025-28 triennium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau told RTHK that universities had been preparing for the reduction and could absorb it without scaling down teaching or administrative staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is acceptable in a way that we do have reserves for research, development, and other expenses. So this two percent, if it's only a triennium cut, I would say that the university community can absorb that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the city's universities were expanding and competing globally, which requires substantial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities will also have to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government on a one-off basis, the University Grants Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said while this is not good news, institutions were developing income sources including self-funded postgraduate programmes to help balance the funding cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we don't welcome any cut because universities are expanding our scope and we are competing with other world-class universities in the ranking, and we are helping our country to build up an even stronger higher education community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant from the 2025-26 academic year, Lau believed the impact on low-income pupils would be minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That HK$2,500 was given to students when most students were having these online classes and they require a lot more assistance, but now we are back to a normal situation. So I don't think this is a kind of financial aid that we need to continue," he said.

    'Public sector pay freeze is the best choice'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she supported the government's decision to freeze public servants' pay.
 <br>
  <br>
  This includes civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary, legislators and district councillors.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted it would be up to the chief executive to decide whether or not to cut the salary of fellow Exco members, or even donate their salary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think freezing public servants' pay, including our pay, legislators' pay, is the best option forward in the present circumstances," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cut backs will have ripple effects on the private sector and it will affect the labour sector as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that two percent of the civil service would be cut annually between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, but Ip believes the move will not affect government efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Yip, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said slashing 10,000 civil service posts by April 2027 is reasonable, given advances in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess those jobs may be coming from those administrative positions... We are not talking about effectiveness, but talking about efficiency. They can gain a lot from the application of AI," Yip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in that regard, to a certain extent, the cost can be minimal."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chilean authorities said they had restored power to most homes on Wednesday, hours after a massive, rare blackout caused transport chaos in the capital and forced the president to declare a state of emergency and curfew across much of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chile's worst blackout in well over a decade struck on Tuesday afternoon, leaving millions without power.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Gabriel Boric blamed private companies that manage the grid for the system's failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is outrageous! The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job," Boric said in a statement issued by his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early Wednesday, "90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored" to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south -- an area home to over 90 percent of Chile's 20 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Boric had activated "a state of emergency due to a catastrophe" and announced a curfew until 6am Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3.16pm in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no reason to assume that this is an attack," she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely "a failure in the system's operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations "to support safe evacuations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under a hot sun to reach their homes. (AFP)

    South Korea births rose last year on surge in marriage

<img alt="South Korea's birthrate, the lowest in the world, rose in 2024 for the first time in nine years. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793287_1_20250226145543.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of births in South Korea rose last year for the first time in roughly a decade on the back of a rise in marriages, officials said on Wednesday, bucking a trend for a country battling a demographic crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has one of the world's longest life expectancies and lowest birth rates -- a combination that presents a looming demographic challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crude birth rate -- the number of babies born per 1,000 people -- was 4.7, interrupting a continuous downward trend since 2014, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the fertility rate, or the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, was 0.75, "up 0.03 from 0.72 in 2023", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of births in 2024 was 238,300, an increase of 8,300 (3.6 percent) from the previous year," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Hyun-jeong, an official from Statistics Korea, attributed the rise to an increase in marriages as well as shifting demographics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The population has seen a significant increase in the number of people in their early 30s," she told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has had a major impact," Park explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, many marriages that were delayed due to Covid-19 have now taken place, and this upward trend continues."
  <br>
  <br>
  Park said the number of marriages last year had been the most since 1996 -- "the highest on record".
  <br>
  <br>
  The average maternal age at childbirth in 2024 was 33.7 years, Seoul said, one of the highest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the fertility rate remains far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain South Korea's population of 51 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates, the population will nearly halve to 26.8 million by 2100, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. (AFP)

    Dose of sweeteners in budget despite belt-tightening

<img alt="The government has announced various relief measures to support residents and businesses. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793261_1_20250226133409.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Efforts to contain government spending didn't stop Financial Secretary Paul Chan from sprinkling some sweeteners into the budget announced on Wednesday, but his offerings were slimmed down this time around.
 <br>
  <br>
  The familiar 100 percent reduction in salaries tax or tax under personal assessment will be provided once again, but this time with a cap of HK$1,500. That's half last year's HK$3,000 ceiling, which itself was half the previous year's HK$6,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a reduction in profits tax for the current financial year but the cap is being halved as well, also to HK$1,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said more than 2.1 million taxpayers and over 165,000 businesses will benefit from these two relief measures which will take a HK$3.1 billion bite out of government revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homeowners, meanwhile, will get a rates concession of up to HK$500 for the first quarter of 2025/26, as will owners of non-domestic properties. Last time, it was HK$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra dose of cash for social security recipients has also survived the budget constraints and is unchanged from last year, with an additional half-month payment of regular allowances, including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Disability Allowance and Working Family Allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also had some good news for people planning to buy property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To ease the burden on buyers of residential and non‑residential properties at lower values, I announce that the maximum value of properties chargeable to a stamp duty of HK$100 will be raised from HK$3 million to HK$4 million with immediate effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's budget sweeteners amount to HK$8.3 billion in total, down from HK$11.5 billion last year.

    Airport departure tax, govt fees to go up

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan proposed in his budget blueprint on Wednesday an increase in air passenger departure tax and certain government fees and charges to help generate revenue, amid a budget deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The departure tax for air passengers will go up from HK$120 to HK$200 from the third quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, with Chan saying "the impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal".
  <br>
  <br>
  This will generate HK$1.6 billion in revenue to the government each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said transport officials will review the tolls of tunnels and major expressways in the city, and explore charging private vehicles travelling via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has cancelled the tolls of some major tunnels and strategic routes three years ago and the tolls of some government tunnels have not been adjusted for over 30 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private vehicles departing the land borders may be subject to a levy, which Chan expects to generate HK$1 billion each year, assuming a fee of HK$200 per car.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the Transport and Logistics Bureau will review annual licence fees for electric vehicles, parking metre charges and fixed penalties for traffic offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there'll be a HK$600 application fee for various talent and capital investor admission schemes with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visa fees will be raised to HK$600 or HK$1,300 "based on the duration of limit of stay", and expected to generate HK$620 million each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For some time in the past, some government fees and charges have not been adjusted in accordance with the established mechanisms. As a result, these fees and charges are not pegged to their costs and fail to reflect the 'user pays' principle," he said.

    Pay freezes, job and spending cuts to tackle deficit

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793264_1_20250226145526.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he had instructed all bureaux and departments to review their resource allocation and work priorities, and provide public services in a more cost-effective manner by consolidating internal resources, streamlining procedures and leveraging technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  These moves would lay a "sustainable fiscal foundation for future development", he said, with the government facing a deficit of HK$87.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said that in the coming financial year, the government would implement pay freezes for civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary as well as those serving in the legislative and district councils.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the cost cutting measures, Chan proposed the rate of reduction of recurrent government expenditure would be increased from the original one percent to two percent in the 2025‑26 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This arrangement would be extended for two more years to the 2027‑28 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account the one percent cut unveiled for the current financial year, the cumulative rate of reduction would be seven percent in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this would deliver a saving in recurrent government expenditure of around HK$62 billion in the coming financial years up to 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also said the civil service would be reduced by two percent annually between the 2026-27 and 2027-28 financial years, resulting in about 10,000 jobs cut by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts in spending will also affect the education sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would provide HK$68.1 billion to University Grants Committee-funded universities in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This funding has reflected a two percent reduction target each year, which was in line with the magnitude of government's recurrent expenditure cut.

 The government will not sell any commercial sites in the coming year due to a sluggish commercial property market.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In view of the high vacancy rates of offices in recent years and the relatively ample supply in the next few years, the government will not roll out any commercial site for sale in the coming year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply," Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for residential sites, Chan said the 2025-26 land sale list comprises eight plots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with other property projects, it's expected to generate about 13,700 units.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will closely monitor market situation and development, and roll out sites in a paced and orderly manner," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will prepare land for the production of 80,000 private units in the next five years, with about 65 percent of the plots coming from the Northern Metropolis and Tung Chung New Town Extension.
  <br>
  <br>
  On public housing supply, Chan said the government has identified enough land to meet the supply target of 308,000 flats over the next 10 years.

    FS confirms new limits on HK$2 trips

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday confirmed that changes are planned to the city's subsidised public transport fares for the over 60s, dubbing the new arrangement "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 percent discount".
 <br>
  <br>
  Journeys will still cost HK$2 in many cases, but for standard fares which exceed HK$10, only a discount of 80 percent will be provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another change means the number of subsidised trips per month will be capped at 240, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This fine-tuned proposal preserves our policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to the beneficiaries," Chan said in his budget address.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the city's Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme – which covers people of all ages – is also being made less generous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead of people getting back a third of their monthly travel expenses above HK$400, from June the subsidy will only kick in from HK$500. The subsidy cap will remain at HK$400 per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the changes to the two schemes will save the taxpayer HK$6.2 billion in the coming five years.

    Govt to regulate basketball betting

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it will explore regulating basketball betting activities and invite the Hong Kong Jockey Club to submit a proposal on the matter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday that there have been public concerns about illegal basketball betting in the city in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said according to the latest Jockey Club assessment, turnover of illegal basketball betting reached HK$70 billion to HK$90 billion last year, and he stressed the need to combat illegal betting activities in an effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Jockey Club said in a statement that it would submit a detailed proposal to the government, adding it is eager to collaborate on this important policy initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club said the move is essential for addressing the surge in illegal basketball betting, which has contributed to social issues such as loan sharking and underage gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that regulating basketball betting would not only combat illegal betting activities, but also enhance the club's ability to make charitable contributions and generate tax revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok welcomed the move, noting that this approach would not only tackle illegal gambling, but also channel related revenues back to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposal is projected to generate an additional HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in gambling tax revenue annually for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would urge the government on one hand to discuss and also legalise the basketball gambling activities, but on the other hand increase its effort into educating the public through different institutions to make the public aware of the dangers of over gambling or gambling addiction," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The] NBA also would have more activities in this region, not just in Hong Kong but in our neighbouring Macau. They are planning a lot of new activities which will bring in more fans. This is also maybe a result of such attention on basketball."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok hopes the Jockey Club can launch related betting projects before the start of the next NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Lau from the department of sport, physical education and health at Baptist University said that while regulating basketball betting might provide a temporary solution to curbing illegal activities, the long-term consequences could be harmful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the long term, the underground betting is still there. The controversial discussion about gambling in sports, ethically I see it's a problem. When we look at the research studies, the findings tell us that whenever those people spend HK$1 on gambling, the government at the end needs to spend HK$4 to treat [addicted] gamblers. So for the long term, we will suffer," he said.

    HK$300m earmarked for enhanced EV charging network

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government will increase its support for electric vehicles (EVs) by launching a HK$300 million subsidy scheme in the middle of the year for a citywide charging network.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said it is expected the scheme would provide impetus for the industry to install 3,000 fast chargers for EVs across Hong Kong by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted the need for more charging stations given there are more than 100,000 EVs in Hong Kong, about eight times compared with five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also announced new initiatives to enhance waste reduction at source.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government would allocate additional funding of HK$180 million for increasing the number of residential food waste smart recycling bins and food waste collection facilities across the city, as well as expanding the city's recycling network and increasing waste recovery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) will get HK$1.2 billion from the government in the coming year to fund its efforts to attract visitors to the city and pursue the concept of "tourism is everywhere".
 <br>
  <br>
  Panda tourism, horse-racing tourism and eco-tourism will be among the products to be promoted, Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget address on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKTB will collaborate with more international brands to tell the good stories of Hong Kong's tourism," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The board] will continue to support the staging of more meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions in Hong Kong, which are expected to bring about 183,000 additional visitor arrivals and spending of about HK$1.4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has earmarked money to be spent on encouraging cruise ships to make more calls to Hong Kong and use the city as their home port.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief noted that officials are making an effort to attract more people to take in the sights along Victoria Harbour, adding that new refreshment stalls are planned in various locations "to enrich visitor experience".
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has also asked MTR bosses to look into whether the waterfront and former pier sites south of Hung Hom Station can be used for commercial and residential developments, including a yacht club, Chan said.

 Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of the government's efforts to turn the city into an Innovation and Technology (I&T) and science centre for Asia, according to the financial secretary.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he delivered the budget for 2025-26, Paul Chan pledged the government would support Hong Kong's R&D efforts as well as the industrial application of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would set aside HK$1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also said the city would enter the Low Earth Orbit satellite sector, calling it the "new trend in global satellite development".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority would explore a set of streamlined procedures for vetting licence applications for operating Low Earth Orbit satellites, with the relevant work to be completed by this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the government would draw up a medium- to long‑term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong, with a HK$10 billion I&T Industry‑Oriented Fund to channel more capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would invite relevant organisations show their interest in the plans and will to seek funding approval from Legco in the middle of this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

 The Hang Seng Index gained 204.32 points, or 0.89 percent, to open at 23,238 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Australian consumer prices dipped month-on-month in January, dragged lower by a slowdown in housing costs and a drop in holiday travel, an outcome that should help reassure policymakers that inflation is heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the monthly consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.2 percent in January from December, when it rose 0.8 percent. The annual pace held at 2.5 percent, matching market forecasts. (Agencies)

<img alt="The Vocational Training Council’s Dennis Wong says Hong Kong Disneyland should keep innovating to attract new customers. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793187_1_20250226085255.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hospitality expert on Wednesday said Hong Kong Disneylands’s performance is welcome news, after the amusement park reported records in profit and attendance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Disneyland reported a net profit of more than HK$830 million, and its highest-ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is truly good news and it seems that Disney has been performing quite well in maintaining their uniqueness as an attraction among all the international visitors in Hong Kong," the Vocational Training Council’s Dennis Wong told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Wong noted Disney has successfully maintained a strong local and mainland customer core, he said they should keep innovating to attract new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Certainly, they have to maintain the freshness of their product. That’s not only maintaining the physical rides, but they have to make sure they will continue rolling out a lot of events and campaigns.”

  The park will be marking its 20th anniversary from June onward, with its managing director saying the celebrations could be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlético Madrid conceded a two-goal lead then fought back from two down in a wild 4-4 draw with Barcelona in a Copa del Rey semi-final first leg thriller.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Diego Simeone's side scored twice in the opening six minutes through Julián Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann, Barca raced through the gears in a high-octane performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superb Pedri Gonzalez pulled one back with Pau Cubarsi, Inigo Martinez and Robert Lewandowski going on to score for the Catalan giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Llorente netted for Atletico before Alexander Sorloth struck in the 93rd minute to leave the tie perfectly poised ahead of the second leg at the Metropolitano stadium on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a terrible result when you go 4-2 up," Pedri said. "You have to be more careful, these are things we have to learn."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we started badly but I'll focus on how the team reacted," he added. "When we got in front we have to be calmer. The second leg will be difficult, but we will go there to try and win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick left Barca's top goalscorer Lewandowski out of the starting line-up, with Ferran Torres taking his place in a false nine role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone picked a strong side despite his side's extremely tricky fixture list, with this the first of three matches against Barca and a Champions League last 16 tie against Real Madrid on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético took the lead inside the first minute, with Alvarez pouncing at the back post after Griezmann's cross was flicked on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético doubled their lead in the sixth minute when Jules Kounde gave the ball away and Alvarez produced a stunning pass to release Griezmann.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward was being pressured by Alejandro Balde but cleverly worked room for a shot, which Wojciech Szczesny got a hand to but could not keep out.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Atletico's opening salvo, Barcelona dominated the rest of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres should have levelled for Barcelona after Raphinha sent him through on goal but his shot was week and Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso saved easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The La Liga leaders hit two goals in two minutes to pull back level, with Kounde setting up Pedri for the first before Cubarsi nodded home from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Torres spurned another golden chance for Barca's third, rounding Musso but misfiring under pressure from Clement Lenglet, on loan from the Catalans at Atlético. (AFP)

    Wall Street falls amid pessimistic consumer sentiment

<img alt="A report on Tuesday shows confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793174_2_20250226071332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine on Tuesday after another report said US households are getting more pessimistic about the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 5,995 – it's fourth straight drop after setting an all-time high last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 percent to 19,026 as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4 percent to 43,621.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell 2.8 percent, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4 percent. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward US$88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in order to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoom Communications dropped 8.5 percent even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  They helped offset a 2.8 percent rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia, which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the most expensive chips.

    Chelsea thrash Southampton; Villa beaten by Palace

<img alt="Cheslea's Nkunku celebrates after scoring his team first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793177_1_20250226070748.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea moved into the Premier League's top four with a 4-0 demolition of hapless Southampton, but Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League football next season diminished after a 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a run of three consecutive defeats, Chelsea badly needed a response against bottom-of-the-table Saints, who are set for an immediate return to the Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues duly delivered with three first-half goals through Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Levi Colwill for just a third league win 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off at Stamford Bridge, a small band of Chelsea fans gathered to protest against the club's owners over the club's form and discontent over ticket prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the action got underway, it was a much-needed comfortable evening for Enzo Maresca's men which the Italian will hope can restore confidence among his squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nkunku took his tally for the season to 14 but only three of those have come in the Premier League as he has often had to play reserve to the injured Nicolas Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman stooped to head in a corner at the back post before teeing up Neto to blast home a second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colwill headed in Neto's free-kick to make the points safe before the break. Marc Cucurella rounded off the scoring with a calm finish from teenager Tyrique George's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory takes Chelsea two points above Manchester City into fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to English clubs' strong performance in European competition this season, a top-five finish is likely to be enough for a place in next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa had rejuvenated their hopes of a second consecutive season in Europe's elite competition after beating Chelsea on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men have won just one of their last seven league games after a capitulation at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ismaila Sarr's first-half opener was cancelled out early in the second period by Morgan Rogers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta quickly restored Palace's advantage before Sarr and Eddie Nketiah maintained the Eagles fine form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oliver Glasner's side have won seven of their last nine games to rise to 12th, just six points behind Villa in 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton won the battle of the south coast clubs with ambitions of European football next season, over Bournemouth 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro won and converted a penalty on 12 minutes to give the Seagulls the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A wonder strike from Justin Kluivert levelled for the Cherries, but Danny Welbeck's winner moved the sides level on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth sit seventh on goal difference with Brighton in eighth, but now just one point behind fifth-placed City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves missed the chance to pull further clear of the relegation zone after a 2-1 home defeat to Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fast start to both halves saw the visitors take the points as Ryan Sessegnon struck inside the first minute and Rodrigo Muniz got the winner two minutes into the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves remain five points above the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  League leaders Liverpool can take another step towards just their second title in 35 years when they host Newcastle on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second faces third as Arsenal visit Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham host City. (AFP)

    'Doctor of the poor' becomes Venezuela's first saint

<img alt="Jose Gregorio Hernandez was beatified – an earlier step towards sainthood – in 2021. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793161_1_20250226033237.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela will soon have its first saint, after ailing Pope Francis on Tuesday canonised a physician who died more than 100 years ago, revered for his selfless service during a previous pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jose Gregorio Hernandez was born in 1864, studied in Paris, Berlin, Madrid and New York, and died in Caracas in 1919 after being struck by a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was beatified – an earlier step towards sainthood – in 2021 amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Venezuela, a century after Hernandez became known as the "doctor of the poor" caring for patients during another major global pandemic, the Spanish flu.
  <br>
  <br>
  His beatification was made possible after a "miracle" attributed to him was recognised by the Church – the recovery of a 10-year-old girl who had been shot in the head in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors had said she would be permanently brain damaged if she survived, but the girl recovered after her mother prayed to Hernandez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis approved the canonisation of Hernandez and another new saint from his hospital bed in Rome, where he is being treated for double pneumonia, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the pontiff's approval, canonisation is usually formalised at a special mass in honour of the new saint. (AFP)

    A third of Musk's Doge staff resign in protest

<img alt="Elon Musk's downsizing has led to the layoff of more than 20,000 workers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793173_1_20250226062227.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The employees also said many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists, designers and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk posted on his social media site X that the story was “fake news” and suggested that the staffers were “Dem political holdovers" who “would have been fired had they not resigned.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The staffers who resigned had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties were being integrated into Doge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their former office, the USDS, was established under President Obama after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.
  <br>
  <br>
  All previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. (AP)

    FS mulls ways to cut spending, boost revenue in budget

<img alt="With the administration facing a budget deficit, Financial Secretary Paul Chan is expected to find ways to reduce government spending and generate additional revenue. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793106_1_20250225170806.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the government facing a budget shortfall of almost HK$100 billion, all eyes will be on how the financial secretary plans to cut spending and increase revenue when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan is expected to address civil service pay and announce possible reductions in expenditure in some areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people see freezing or even reducing civil service pay as a way to help rein in the deficit and achieve fiscal stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  But others argued that such a move could have a knock-on effect for the wider workforce, as many private firms refer to government salaries in making their own wage decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Ronick Chan, representing the finance constituency, has said freezing or cutting civil service pay would affect millions of workers in the city, and may cause changes in people's consumption patterns, leading to a vicious cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials may also try to save money by cutting spending in other areas, with the financial secretary having cited healthcare and education earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau has said putting public resources to good use is everyone's responsibility. "Nobody should be wasteful... It should be everyone in Hong Kong, and all government departments... We hope our patients make good use of healthcare resources and don't waste medicine. Like they take extra and just keep them at home, or even throw them away."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hospital Authority, Henry Fan, said the authority will fully cooperate with government policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan stressed the government will propose an enhanced fiscal-consolidation strategy to control public expenditure stringently, while using other public resources to speed up the city's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On ways to boost revenue, he has highlighted the user-pays principle, meaning those who can afford to should pay more and at the same time minimising the impact to the average people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taxation Institute said the government could consider raising the standard salaries tax rate for high-income earners from 16 percent to 17 percent, to help boost the public coffers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the financial secretary has also said the administration will have to tread carefully when considering tax reforms, and many factors have to be taken into consideration.

 French President Emmanuel Macron will brief fellow EU leaders on Wednesday on his talks with US President Donald Trump, ahead of an emergency summit on European support for Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Antonio Costa, who heads the European Council representing the bloc's 27 member states, announced on X he had convened a videoconference with Macron to prepare for the March 6 leaders' talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe has scrambled for a unified response since Trump two weeks ago declared his readiness to negotiate with Russia – and without European involvement – on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite a veneer of cordiality, the transatlantic rift over Ukraine was on display during Macron's talks with Trump on Monday – the third anniversary of the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French leader warned at the White House afterwards that peace cannot mean the "surrender" of Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want a quick deal but not a fragile one," said Macron, who insisted any settlement must include US security guarantees for Kyiv – to prevent any future Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  In parallel, the United States sided with Russia in two votes at the United Nations on Monday to avoid condemning Moscow's campaign against Ukraine – a seismic shift from the stance of the previous US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's embrace of Russia has sparked fears that it could herald the end of US support for Kyiv and a major change in attitude toward the rest of Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next week's talks in Brussels will focus on supporting Kyiv and bolstering Europe's defences after Trump's opening to Moscow – at what Costa called "a defining moment for Ukraine and European security." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday pledged to boost defence spending to 2.5 percent of the economy by 2027 with the aim of hiking it to 3 percent in the next parliament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of key talks on Ukraine with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday, Starmer told parliament the increase would be funded by cutting overseas development aid from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has demanded that Nato allies more than double their defence spending targets to five percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK spent 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence in 2023/24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's Labour government had previously committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent, but had not set a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told lawmakers there would be some "hard choices" but it would be the "biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government would also "set a clear ambition for defence spending to rise to 3 percent of GDP in the next parliament," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has repeatedly called on European nations to boost their defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The nature of warfare has changed significantly. That is clear from the battlefield in Ukraine, and so we must modernise and reform our capabilities as we invest," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 months in prison for trafficking in a dangerous drug last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old man was arrested in November as he was leaving Hong Kong from the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers seized about 0.3 grammes of cocaine under the insole of his sneaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Customs and Excise Department welcomed the deterrent sentence, saying it duly reflected the gravity of the offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, the maximum penalty for dangerous drug trafficking upon conviction is a fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

    Search for MH370 resumes 11 years after disappearance

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fresh search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been launched more than a decade after the plane went missing in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke told reporters contract details between Malaysia and the firm were still being finalised but welcomed "the proactiveness of Ocean Infinity to deploy their ships" to begin the search for the plane, which went missing in March 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said details about how long the search would last had not been negotiated yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm restarted its hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government said in December it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane has never been found despite the largest search in aviation history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus," said Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just want to know where it is and what happened," she said. "Memories come back like yesterday, it's fresh in our heads."
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December the new search would be on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay US$70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke had previously said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December a new 15,000 square kilometre (5,800 square mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They combined all the data and they felt confident that the current search area is more credible," Loke said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have convinced us that they are ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories, ranging from the credible to the outlandish, including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
  <br>
  <br>
  A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the plane's course was changed manually. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rain washed out the Champions Trophy game between South Africa and two-time winner Australia on Tuesday without a ball being bowled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pitch remained under covers at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium throughout the day because of a persistent light drizzle before umpires called off the game shortly after 5 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both unbeaten teams go into their last Group B game with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals with three points already secured. Australia play against Afghanistan at Lahore on Friday while South Africa meet England at Karachi on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Australia began their campaigns by posting 300-plus scores against Afghanistan and England, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia, coming into the Champions Trophy without three frontline fast bowlers, made the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 on the back of Josh Inglis’ century against England at Lahore.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa registered an emphatic 107-run win over Afghanistan at Karachi after Ryan Rickelton made his maiden ODI hundred in a strong total of 315-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand and India have already qualified for the semi-finals after winning both their Group A games against Pakistan and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  England will take on Afghanistan in a must-win game for both teams to stay in semi-final contention in Lahore on Wednesday. (AP)

    Three arrested 'for claiming to sell Kai Tak tickets'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested three people for allegedly claiming they had spare tickets on sale for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday, with tickets reportedly being offered at marked up prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 8,500 tickets for the opening ceremony on March 1 were available at HK$10 each and were snapped up within around half an hour of being available on February 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  As many as 33,600 spectators are expected to attend the star-studded event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who successfully made a purchase online via a real-name registration system will first receive electronic vouchers to exchange for the real tickets at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Tuesday, police officers accused the trio of jacking up the prices and intending to sell the tickets online at a range between HK$100 and HK$2,000 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Preliminary investigations showed two of the suspects did not hold the vouchers and the force has yet to ascertain whether the coupon held by the remaining person was authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added it has not ruled out making further arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports commissioner George Tsoi said successful buyers can only get the actual tickets from Thursday, two days before the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the exchange takes place, we will check the voucher holder's identity. If the identity does not match, no tickets will be issued, and the person will not be able to enter the venue," he said.

    HK's exports growth slows notably in January

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports growth slowed significantly last month, while imports picked up, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the value of the city's total exports of goods rose just 0.1 percent year-on-year to HK$389.1 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That compares with a 5.1 percent annual rise in December and 2.1 percent increase in November, and was the slowest pace of growth in almost a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of total imports, however, rose 0.5 percent year-on-year last month to stand at HK$387.1 billion, following a 1.1 percent contraction in December and growth of 5.7 percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson partly attributed January's moderate growth to the timing of Lunar New Year, and said it is more appropriate to analyse the trade data for the January-February period combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, while uncertainties in the external environment, in particular escalating trade protectionism, would continue to weigh on Hong Kong's export performance, steady global economic growth, together with the Central Government's various measures to boost the mainland economy, would provide support," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was forced to shut partially for more than an hour on Tuesday after a piece of concrete fell from the ceiling and hit a vehicle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received a report shortly after 1pm of a car travelling through the tunnel being hit by a concrete slab that measured about 50cm by 50cm.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Island-bound fast lane was closed for emergency repair works, leading to congestion. It was reopened to traffic at 2.48pm.

 Four people, including two Chinese nationals, were killed and six injured after a bridge collapsed at an expressway construction site in South Korea on Tuesday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media aired dramatic footage of what appeared to be a section of the bridge collapsing, sending a massive cloud of smoke into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were killed, five were seriously injured and one suffered a minor injury, a statement from the National Fire Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of those killed, two were Chinese nationals and two were South Koreans, an interior ministry official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident occurred at around 9.50am in Anseong, around 65 kilometres south of the South Korean capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All individuals who suffered injuries are currently being treated at hospitals," the National Fire Agency's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency initially said it took place in the nearby city of Cheonan but later corrected that claim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai Engineering, the main contractor of the construction site, apologised and said it was assisting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sincerely bow our heads in apology to those who lost their precious lives and were injured in the accident at our construction site," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively cooperating with the relevant authorities to ensure a prompt resolution on-site" and to identify the cause of the accident, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok issued urgent directives to mobilise all available resources and personnel for the rescue operation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland on Tuesday said it enjoyed its strongest ever business performance in the last fiscal year, with a record net profit of more than HK$830 million and highest ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing director Michael Moriarty said the park will be celebrating its 20th anniversary from June onwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary is going to be one of the top mega events for the town to rally around. We're working with other partners as well who are just as excited,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think with our combined effort, this can be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals, giving reasons for people to come back, not to just to Hong Kong Disneyland, but to Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriarty said the celebrations will include the park's largest ever parade called “Friendtastic!”, and a special edition of the night show “Momentous”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park will also expand its Marvel-themed section and create a Pixar entertainment experience, with construction work to begin this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park also announced a pay rise of 3.6 to 5 percent for eligible cast members, backdated to the beginning of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said eligible full-time staff will also be awarded discretionary bonuses equivalent to 1.8 to 2.4 months' worth of their base salary.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted President Yoon Suk-yeol faced his final impeachment hearing on Tuesday before judges decide whether to formally remove him from office over his disastrous martial law declaration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived suspension of civilian rule plunged democratic South Korea into political turmoil, and he was removed from office by parliament in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 64-year-old has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on charges of insurrection, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison or even face the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  His trial began last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of fraught impeachment hearings at the Constitutional Court in Seoul, Tuesday's court session was his last before the eight judges go behind closed doors to decide his fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proceedings began at 2pm but Yoon was not present, reporters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of lawmakers from his ruling People Power Party were in attendance, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  In opening remarks, Yoon's defence team cited a 2024 US Supreme Court ruling, Donald Trump v. the United States, arguing the ousted president cannot be punished for "exercising his core constitutional powers".
  <br>
  <br>
  That ruling "should be considered in the context of impeachment proceedings", Yoon's lawyer Lee Dong-chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is expected to deliver a closing argument in his defence, with representatives of parliament given time to present the case for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, pro-Yoon protesters chanted "Drop impeachment!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Others held signs saying "Stop the Steal", echoing US President Trump's false claims of voter fraud when he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  A verdict is widely expected in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is removed from office, the country must hold a fresh presidential election within 60 days. (AFP)

    Drug warehouse raid finds HK$430m of cocaine

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police arrested two men following a raid on a drug warehouse, where officers seized approximately 520 kilogrammes of suspected cocaine, valued at over HK$430 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers intercepted the men at a residential building in Tseung Kwan O on Sunday, discovering two kilos of cocaine in one man's bag, along with an additional 518 kilos in their unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Tong Wai-kwok, from the Narcotics Bureau, said the cocaine was suspected to have been smuggled into the city from South America via shipping freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drug trafficking group simultaneously rented a unit in Kwai Chung, where they used legitimate logistics companies to transport drugs arriving in Hong Kong to the Kwai Chung unit for processing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There, over 1,500 boxes of frozen goods were inspected, and some cocaine concealed within was extracted, repackaged, and disguised as regular cargo. The drugs were then transferred to a private residential unit for storage and distribution."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong said the group frequently changed locations through different logistics and transport companies to evade detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Superintendent Ng Kwok-Cheung said the two men, aged 22 and 23, were unemployed and likely committed these crimes to make money quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two men were arrested for drug trafficking, and the case will be brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday.

    'Child car seats wouldn't work on public transport'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A new law requiring child car seats or other extra restraints to be fitted in private vehicles carrying children would be too difficult to implement on public transport, the government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  From November, child restraining devices must be used in private cars for children under eight, unless they are at least 1.35 metres tall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A chief engineer at the Transport Department, Eddy Wu, said half of traffic accidents affecting under eights involve private cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it would be difficult for public transport operators to install restraining devices to suit all child passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Children of different ages require different kinds of restraints. For example, older children only need a booster seat, while infants need a baby car seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If public transport operators also had to offer suitable devices for children of different ages, or offer a certain quantity, it might create obstacles for their daily operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also explained why children at least 1.35 metres tall will not need extra restraints. He said this is because their feet will touch the floor and an adult seatbelt would not cut into their necks.

    Improve HK's vocational training system: FTU

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Tuesday said the government should allocate more resources to improve Hong Kong’s vocational training system to cultivate more locally skilled talent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) surveyed 120 vocational training students between October and December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 70 percent of respondents said they were able to land a job within three months of graduation, and more than 90 percent agreed career education in junior secondary years should be strengthened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Tang, the general secretary of the FTU’s occupational retraining centre, said it is important to encourage young people to think about different career paths while they are still at school.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe education is a crucial point. If we cannot start from adolescence, or the student’s level, we cannot [emphasise] the importance of vocational training. The education is not only for students, it is also for their parents and teachers,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union suggested the government increase social recognition towards applied learning subjects in the HKDSE public examination, by raising the highest attainable level from four to five.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said this would draw more connections between students' learning experiences and their career development, therefore encouraging more to consider a path outside of traditional academics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FTU also called for an improvement in the social status of skilled labour, while providing more opportunities for people to advance in their careers, as a way to solve the labour shortage problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our strategy is to enhance professional career education, and the main theme is to enhance [students'] working skill level, so that they can reach local and overseas needs. If we can cooperate with all of society, we can reach our goal,” Tang said.

    Self-parking cars good for new drivers: motoring group

<div class="itemFullText">
 A motoring group has welcomed a change in the law which will allow drivers to use technology to get their cars to park themselves.
 <br>
  <br>
  From March 1, it will be legal for motorists to use smartphones or other devices to enable remote control parking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, Ringo Lee, told RTHK on Tuesday that the technology will be especially useful when parking in tight spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's absolutely safe for those who aren't familiar with driving, or even novice drivers. Because the vehicle itself makes use of a lot of technology... laser or infrared cameras, etc... to park. It's not parking arbitrarily," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said insurance companies should expand third-party insurance to cover drivers in the event an incident is caused by a faulty car system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other transport-related rule changes from March 1 include allowing dashboard monitors in vehicles to show non-driving related content once the handbrake is on, and more types of electric vehicles will be allowed to use expressways without the need for a permit.
