    World scrambles to temper Trump tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799149_1_20250407011036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 50 countries have sought talks with President Donald Trump in a scramble to ease punishing tariffs on exports to the United States, the White House said on Sunday, as trade partners braced for fallout.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has remained defiant since unleashing the blitz of levies on stunned countries around the world on Wednesday, insisting that his policies "will never change" even as markets went into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his staggered deadlines have left space for some countries to negotiate, even as he insisted he would stand firm and his administration warned against any retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation," Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council, told CNN on Sunday, citing the US Trade Representative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they were doing so "because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariffs," as the administration continues to insist that the duties would not lead to major price rises in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told NBC's Meet the Press that 50 countries had reached out.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as for whether Trump will negotiate with them, "I think that's a decision for President Trump," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this moment he's created maximum leverage for himself... I think we're going to have to see what the countries offer, and whether it's believable," Bessent said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other countries have been "bad actors for a long time, and it's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks," he claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long insisted that countries around the world that sell products to the United States are in fact ripping Americans off, and he sees tariffs as a means to right that wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many economists have warned that tariffs are passed on to consumers and that they could see price rises at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, the uncertainty over trade and manufacturing has helped fuel a days-long panic in global markets. (AFP)

<img alt="The boy was shot dead in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799159_1_20250407060637.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Palestinian official told AFP that Israeli forces shot dead a teenager holding US citizenship in the occupied West Bank Sunday, while the Israeli military said it had killed a "terrorist" who threw rocks at cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Omar Muhammad Saadeh Rabee, a 14-year-old "who was killed in Turmus Ayya, held US citizenship," the town's mayor, Lafi Shalabi, told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that during "counter-terrorism activity" in Turmus Ayya, "soldiers identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soldiers opened fire toward the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists," a military statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian health ministry said one person was in critical condition and another suffered minor injuries in the same incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shalabi said one of the wounded also had US citizenship. And Turmus Ayya, northest of the main West Bank city of Ramallah, is known for having many dual US-Palestinian citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestine Red Crescent said its teams had taken the body of the deceased boy to a hospital. It also reported the injuries of two boys shot in the lower abdomen and thigh respectively, during "clashes" in Turmus Ayya.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the two, 14-year-old Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, told AFP he was shot by a soldier while collecting fruit near the town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second, who was shot in the abdomen, was identified as 14-year-old Ayoub Asaad by his father Ahed Asaad. He confirmed that the boy had a US passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahed Assad said that an ambulance that took his wounded son to hospital was stopped by soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stopped at a military checkpoint at the village entrance, and a soldier told me that he was the one who shot the three boys," he told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Authority's foreign affairs ministry denounced the Israeli forces' "use of live fire against three children".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel's continued impunity as an illegal occupying power encourages it to commit further crimes", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violence has soared in the West Bank since the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 918 Palestinians, including militants, in the West Bank since then, according to Palestinian health ministry figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian attacks and clashes during military raids have killed at least 33 Israelis, including soldiers, over the same period, according to official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has occupied the West Bank, home to about three million Palestinians, since 1967. (AFP)

<img alt="Protesters gathered during a rally in Paris in support of President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen, after she was convicted. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799140_1_20250406211858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Marine Le Pen on Sunday invoked Martin Luther King's struggle for civil rights as her far-right party planned to rally its supporters after she was convicted of embezzlement and banned from public office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bombshell judgement that could crush Le Pen's dream of winning the French presidency in 2027 has stunned the country's political establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some leftwing forces and the centrist camp staged counter gatherings on Sunday against the far right, while the judges who convicted Le Pen have received threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, ahead of the rally, Le Pen urged her supporters to take inspiration from one of America's pre-eminent advocates of nonviolence in the fight for equal rights for black Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will follow the example of Martin Luther King, who defended civil rights," she told members of Italy's hard-right League party, who were meeting in Florence, via video-link.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, Marine, we don't want to take up any more of your time," said Italian deputy prime minister, League leader Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today will be an important day for you, for France," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a meeting of President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party in the northern working-class Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, former prime minister Gabriel Attal accused the far right of "attacking our judges, attacking our institutions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We, here, will never disqualify a court decision," said 36-year-old Attal, speaking in the presence of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and fellow former premier Edouard Philippe, who also hopes to run in the 2027 presidential elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Le Pen, 56, was found guilty of embezzling European Parliament funds and given a partly suspended jail term and an immediate ban on holding public office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her supporters branded the ruling politically motivated, but Macron insisted the French judiciary is "independent".
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump called the sentence a "witch hunt" by "European leftists using lawfare to silence free speech, and censor their political opponent".
  <br>
  <br>
  Some left-wingers including members of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party staged a counter rally in Place de la Republique which attracted several hundred people. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said on Sunday that foreign elite runners arrived to take part in the first Pyongyang Marathon in six years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Athletes from China, Romania and other countries arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage from KCNA showed hundreds of runners taking off from the stadium track starting point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon is part of celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung in 1912 and is the largest international sporting event in North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offers a rare opportunity for visitors to run through the streets of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon course winds through central Pyongyang, passing key landmarks and heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, before returning back to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last edition of the Pyongyang Marathon was held in 2019 before the pandemic, during which the state sealed its borders in an effort to contain the virus. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, who is recovering after a serious case of pneumonia, made a surprise public appearance Sunday as he mingled with crowds at the Vatican just two weeks after leaving hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A good Sunday to all. Thank you very much", the 88-year old Pope said as he was wheeled through Saint Peter's Square in his wheelchair after a mass dedicated to the sick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by a mass of smartphones and cameras, and attached to nasal breathing tubes, his voice was fragile but more audible than when he left the Gemelli hospital on March 23. His last public appearance was February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis is, in theory, undergoing two months of convalescence following his life-threatening health scare, with strict rest, no public activity and no contact with crowds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Saturday it was "unacceptable" and deeply concerning that Israel had detained two UK lawmakers and denied them entry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, from the governing Labour Party, flew from London to Israel but were blocked from entering the country and deported, British media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities," Lammy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UK government's focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since renewed military operations last month ended a short-lived truce in its war with Hamas, Israel has pushed to seize territory in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health ministry in Gaza said 1,249 people have been killed since Israel resumed intense bombing last month, bringing the overall death toll since the war began to 50,609. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rain was compounding misery and presenting new hurdles for relief efforts on Sunday in Myanmar, where state media reported the death toll from a devastating earthquake had risen to nearly 3,500 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 7.7-magnitude quake struck on March 28, razing buildings, cutting off power and destroying bridges and roads across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damage has been particularly severe in the city of Sagaing near the epicentre, as well as in Mandalay, Myanmar's second city and home to more than 1.7 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media in the military junta-led country on Sunday said the earthquake caused 3,471 confirmed deaths and injured 4,671 people, while 214 remained missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  With people either having lost their homes entirely or reluctant to spend time in cracked and unstable structures, many Mandalay residents have been sleeping outside in tents.
  <br>
  <br>
  When wind and rain began battering the rudimentary shelters on Saturday evening, victims were forced to choose between passing the night in dry but risky buildings or outdoors in the elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People are trying to rebuild their lives now," said United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher in a video filmed in Mandalay, posted to X on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They need food. They need water. They need the power back on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people in the area are still without shelter, he said, describing the scale of damage in the area as "epic".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to get tents and hope to survivors as they rebuild their shattered lives," Fletcher wrote in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid experts warn that rainy conditions and scorching heat increase the risk of disease outbreaks at outdoor camps where victims were in temporary shelter. (AFP)

 The Transport Department on Sunday called on people coming to Hong Kong to see the band Coldplay this week to plan their journeys in advance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British band will be the first to hold concerts at the new Kai Tak Stadium, with performances on April 8, 9, 11 and 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said there will be special transport arrangements on those days, including bus routes to the border and extra trains on the MTR's Tuen Ma and East Rail lines.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be cross-boundary coaches departing from Kai Tak, but tickets must be bought in advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, spectators should opt for public transport and avoid driving," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No parking spaces will be provided in the KTSP during the event period."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that it will "mobilise the taxi trade" to pick up passengers at the stadium.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen led from pole to chequered flag to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, his first victory of the 2025 season, with McLaren's Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough. The McLarens were pushing me very hard," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a lot of fun but not easy pushing the tyres. I am incredibly happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting on pole made it possible to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with RB's Isack Hadjar next ahead of Williams' Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th in his first race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, having started from 14th on the grid in his home grand prix. Lawson was 17th for RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen and Norris were involved in a flashpoint midway through the race as the two front-runners emerged from a pit stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris drew up alongside Verstappen but the Dutchman refused to budge and Norris was forced onto the grass before sliding back onto the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said "he forced me off" but Verstappen told his team that he was not to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He drove himself onto the grass," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards reviewed the incident and decided not to investigate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has struggled to get to grips with his Red Bull this season, finishing second in Australia and fourth in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pulled off a lap for the ages in qualifying in Suzuka, pipping Norris to claim his first pole of the season in a track-record time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen got away cleanly from Norris and Piastri at the first turn, with little change in the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman quickly established control by laying down the fastest lap and his lead grew over the early part of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen-year-old rookie Antonelli briefly took the lead while Verstappen and Norris were in the pits, to become Formula One's youngest-ever race leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen soon reclaimed the lead and his team gave him the green light to push until the end of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two McLarens stayed on his tail, with Piastri telling his team "I have the pace to get Max" but Verstappen could not be caught.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Suzuka had been dry all week, with a series of small trackside fires halting practice several times but rain early on Sunday removed any chance of a repeat in the race. (AFP)

    A&amp;E fee changes boost medical protection: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Changes to fees for treatment at Accident and Emergency departments will provide the public with better medical protection, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Planned adjustments will see the HK$180 charge for an A&E visit increase to HK$400 from next year for patients who aren't deemed to be critically ill or an emergency case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other public hospital fees will also change, although there will be a HK$10,000 annual cap on payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo told TVB that the reforms are akin to the government providing everyone in Hong Kong with free medical insurance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are providing more medical protection to the poor and to those in need of urgent or critical care. This improved protection will benefit seven-and-a-half million people. Everyone in Hong Kong gets extra medical protection. It's just like the government gifting medical insurance to everyone," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo also said the authorities are looking into charging patients for any appointments they miss, likening such a move to hotels billing guests who fail to show up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hotels will keep your credit card information, and if you do not appear on the day, or only inform the hotel of your absence on the day, then you should be charged for that cost," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will calmly face any problems caused by US tariffs with the government providing support to local firms, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Donald Trump administration last week imposed new tariffs on virtually all of Washington's trading partners around the world, including an extra 34 percent on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said US tariffs will put tremendous pressure on trade and the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government has been on the alert and Hong Kong is already less reliant on the US when it comes to exports than in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As unilateralism has gradually been on the uptrend in recent years, Hong Kong companies have made adjustments with regards to their export markets," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Data shows that last year, goods heading to the US accounted for 6.5 percent of the SAR's overall exports, compared to 8.6 percent in 2018."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said firms have been turning their attention to Asean and countries in the Middle East, while the government has been helping companies find new markets and with digitilisation.

    'Packaging reduction charter better than legislation'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan has rejected the idea of legislation to force businesses to cut down on their use of packaging, saying many are willing to sign up to the cause voluntarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched a "Packaging Reduction Charter" last week and more than 100 firms have signed up so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charter is aimed at eight sectors, including supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers and the hospitality trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his official blog on Sunday, Tse said given that packaging comes in various forms, it would be difficult to set standardised versions via legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firms signing up to the charter agree to submit an annual report on their use of packaging and the information will be collated by the government with a view to taking steps towards future improvements, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that as well as pledging to reduce their use of packaging or find sustainable alternatives, the companies involved have agreed to encourage their suppliers, business partners and customers to do the same.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior came up just short at the Dubai Turf, as trainer Danny Shum's champion was edged by the slimmest of margins by Soul Rush from Japan in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jockey James McDonald and the SAR's runners were among the leading pack for much of the 1,800 metre Grade One course, and led almost the entire way after the turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they were overtaken by jockey Cristian Demuro's Soul Rush on virtually the last stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his three-race trip in the Middle East, Romantic Warrior won the Jebel Hatta in Dubai and was also runner-up in the Saudi Cup in Riyadh.

    'AI guidelines push to help prevent data leaks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong firms making use of generative artificial intelligence may run the risk of data breaches, Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung warned on Sunday, as she explained how new advice issued by her office will help mitigate the dangers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Chung issued a checklist for companies that is designed to help them develop internal policies or guidelines on the use of Gen AI by their staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  It suggested that firms cover what areas of work AI can be used for, as well as data security, ethical considerations and the protection of personal privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some organisations may not know that if they input clients' personal information into AI, the AI may leak this information to another party," Chung told Commercial Radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an example, she said retail stores may use AI to analyse the preferences of their customers, but this could be problematic if they don't strip out information such as names and telephone numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chung said companies with questions on how their use of AI can comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance are welcome to make use of a new hotline her office has set up, adding that more promotion and education work will be carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that her team has the authority to investigate any incidents where people's privacy is endangered by a company's use of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can investigate incidents when we receive data breach reports and after that we can issue reports, or even publicly condemn the organisations involved. We can also issue enforcement notices to them and it is a criminal offence if an organisation does not abide by a notice," she noted.

    Jaguar Land Rover to pause UK car shipments to US

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, it said on Saturday, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of President Donald Trump's 25 percent tariff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, confirmed the temporary export suspension after the Times newspaper reported the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly, is highly exposed to the new tariffs. The United States is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20 percent share, data from industry body SMMT shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Britain's biggest producers by volume, said in its statement that the US was an important market for its luxury brands. It sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually and exports to the US account for almost a quarter of sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US 25 percent tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3, the day after Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe. (Reuters)

 Donald Trump told Americans on Saturday to “hang tough” in the face of economic turmoil caused by sweeping tariffs introduced on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his Truth Social site, the US President promised “historic” results from what he called an “economic revolution”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alarm about the fallout of Wednesday’s tariff announcement has gripped global financial markets, with Wall Street's fear level at a five-year high while financial executives expressed shock and worry about economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trillions were wiped off stock market values as investors said they were fearful about the risk of recession ahead. US stock markets slumped more than 10 percent in two days, with the Nasdaq Composite now in a bear market, as China imposed fresh tariffs on all US goods, sparking worries of an extended global trade war.

<img alt="Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta reacts on the pitch after the match between Everton and Arsenal at Goodison Park. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799081_1_20250406071657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's faint hopes of catching Premier League leaders Liverpool are almost over after their 1-1 draw at Everton, while Aston Villa bolstered their bid for Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a frantic finale, Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke was shown a red card for his foul on Daichi Kamada.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire US presidential adviser Elon Musk said on Saturday he hoped Europe and the United States would agree to join in a free-trade zone after US leader Donald Trump unleashed heavy global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sweeping tariffs announced earlier this week sent global stocks tumbling, worried allies, and raised the prospect of others – possibly the European Union – raising tariffs themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, which faces a 20 per cent tariff, has already vowed to retaliate in "a calm, carefully phased, unified way", EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the United States and Europe can establish a very close partnership," Musk said in a video address to a gathering of the Italian hard-right party La Liga.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America," he added in the video, posted on Musk's social media platform X by La Liga's leader, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire said he favoured "more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America" for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That has certainly been my advice to the president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he reiterated his condemnation of what he saw as mass immigration. (AFP)

    China says US must 'stop using tariffs as a weapon'

<img alt='Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun wrote on Facebook that "the market has spoken," after Wall Street headed south two days in a row. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799060_1_20250405203120.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Saturday "the market has spoken" in rejecting US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and called on Washington for "equal-footed consultation" after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency also published the central government's stance, saying the US should "stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has spoken," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday. He also posted a picture capturing Friday's falls on US stock markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump introduced additional 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets plummeted following China's retaliation and Trump's comments on Friday that he would not change course, extending sharp losses that followed Trump's initial tariff announcement earlier in the week and marking the biggest losses since the pandemic. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for the US to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation," Guo wrote in English on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement published by the Xinhua news agency, the central government urged the US: "Stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests," said the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington "seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously undermines the stability of the global economic order," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, several industry chambers of commerce ranging from those representing traders in metals and textiles to electronics, issued statements condemning the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's chamber of commerce, representing traders in food products, called on "China's food and agricultural products import and export industry to unite and strengthen cooperation to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India secured defence and energy deals with neighbouring Sri Lanka on Saturday during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake rolled out the red carpet for Modi and conferred on him the country's highest civilian honour for "the deep personal friendship" shown to the smaller neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that our security interests are aligned," Modi said during a televised ceremony from Dissanayake's office in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our security is interdependent and interconnected."
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-year defence cooperation agreement provides training of Sri Lankan military personnel in India as well as information and technology sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissanayake applauded what he called "India's rise as a world power, not just a regional power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have reiterated our position to Prime Minister Modi that Sri Lankan territory will not be allowed to be used by anyone to undermine India's security," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Dissanayake welcomed Modi – the first foreign dignitary to visit Colombo since the leftist leader swept to power last year – with a 19-gun salute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders also celebrated the start of construction of a 120-megawatt solar power project, developed as a joint venture between the two nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar plant, located in the island's northeastern Trincomalee district, had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi's backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi's visit to Sri Lanka followed a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of neighbouring nations as he sought to shore up India's regional ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Bangkok BIMSTEC meeting – the grouping of seven nations on the Bay of Bengal – Modi held a rare face-to-face meeting with Myanmar's junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also held talks on Friday with the interim leader of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus – the first such meeting since a revolution in Dhaka ousted New Delhi's long-time ally Sheikh Hasina and sent relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi also met on Friday in Bangkok with his Nepali counterpart, KP Sharma Oli – their first meeting since Oli returned to power last year – as well as Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan. (AFP)

 Thomas Müller will leave Bayern Munich this summer after a 25-year career at the German club.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Müller said on Saturday, in a joint announcement with Bayern, that his “incredible journey” with his boyhood club will end in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder's contract is set to expire after the season and he's seen limited game time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s clear that today is not like any other day for me," Müller said. "My 25 years as an FC Bayern Munich player will come to an end in the summer. It’s been an incredible journey, shaped by unique experiences, great encounters and unforgettable triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel immense gratitude and joy that I got to make this career with my beloved club. The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain. What I want as a farewell should be clear: titles we can celebrate together, and moments we’ll remember fondly for a long time.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said Hong Kong will not impose countermeasures even though the United States announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on Chinese imports, and Beijing authorities have struck back, imposing a 34 percent tariff on all US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar organised by the Hong Kong News-Expo, Chan said Hong Kong will not impose any countermeasures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Allowing a free flow of capital and acting as a free port are our advantages, and this will not change. The SAR government, of course, strongly opposes the actions by the US, and we also need to be defensive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But on the other hand, we think we should persist in being free and open. The rules-based multilateral trading system is our core."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said Hong Kong has an overseeing mechanism to identify risks that may threaten the financial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, he said companies from the United States and Western countries regarded the mainland and Hong Kong as "non-investable" markets in the past years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But foreign investors changed their mind with the rise of DeepSeek earlier this year, he said, reassessing the potential of the country's innovation and technological companies.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Water Supplies said on Saturday that while the department is still reviewing water charges, its objective is to achieve the principle of user pays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Roger Wong revealed on a television programme that the public's average daily water consumption has dropped by 12 percent compared to during the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department has been reviewing water charges, which have been kept at the same level for almost three decades, since last year, and Wong said the authorities also have to take into account people's livelihoods, as well as the current economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a number of stakeholders - the catering, hotel and construction sectors, to learn more about their level of water consumption, and obtain their views on price adjustments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite good. Many of them understood that the charge has not been adjusted for years, and find it reasonable if there's a change. But they said they hope the increment can be imposed in a gradual manner, instead of us charging them a lot more all at once."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that water pipes in Hong Kong have been in use for about 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  About one to two percent of them are considered very old, the director said, and they are located near residential areas or busier roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  A working group has been set up to carry out the prevention of water mains bursts more efficiently, Wong added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th on his Red Bull debut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out," said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Good but not enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifying was suspended for about eight minutes in Q2 when a small trackside fire broke out as sparks from the cars ignited the grass in the dry conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fifth such incident of the weekend, with the second and third practice sessions also disrupted by fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain has been forecast for Sunday's race. (AFP)

    Youth facilities to open in Kai Tak by October

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said youth facilities will be set up at the original site of an isolation facility in Kai Tak by October this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address last year that the government will turn the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility into a "Youth Post" hostel and spaces for cultural and arts exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Mak said her bureau has finished assessing the tenders, and chosen Glorise Tourism & Culture, which is under the China Travel Service, as the organisation to operate the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be co-organised by CTG Development and Dorsett Hospitality International, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will transform 60 percent of the total floor area of the isolation facility into a youth hostel, and gradually organise youth and international exchange activities with cultural, arts and sports elements according to their five-year plan," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak added that the lease term is five years, and the organisation has to operate the facilities on a self-financing basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  She expects the relevant facilities to commence operation in phases by October.

    Myanmar quake death toll passes 3,300

<img alt="Many people have to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799034_1_20250405153937.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a major earthquake in Myanmar has risen above 3,300, state media said on Saturday, as the United Nations aid chief made a renewed call for the world to help the disaster-struck nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The March 28 quake flattened buildings and destroyed infrastructure across the country, resulting in 3,354 deaths and 4,508 people injured, with 220 others missing, according to new figures published by state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than one week after the disaster, many people in the country are still without shelter, either forced to sleep outdoors because their homes were destroyed or wary of further collapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Nations estimate suggests that more than three million people may have been affected by the 7.7-magnitude quake, compounding previous challenges caused by four years of civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN's top aid official on Saturday met with victims in the central Myanmar city of Mandalay – situated close to the epicentre and now grappling with severe damage across the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The destruction is staggering," Tom Fletcher wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world must rally behind the people of Myanmar."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new toll was announced after the country's military junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from a rare foreign trip to a regional summit in Bangkok on Friday, where he met with leaders including the prime ministers of Thailand and India.
  <br>
  <br>
  The general's attendance at the summit courted controversy, with protesters at the venue displaying a banner calling him a "murderer" and anti-junta groups condemning his inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  His armed forces have ruled Myanmar since a 2021 coup, when they wrested power from the civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a multi-sided conflict that has yet to be resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta has reportedly conducted dozens of attacks since the earthquake, including at least 16 since a temporary truce was announced on Wednesday, the UN said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of fighting have left Myanmar's economy and infrastructure in tatters, significantly hampering international efforts to provide relief since the quake.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, Russia and India were among the first countries to provide support, sending rescue teams to Myanmar to help locate survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has traditionally been at the forefront of international disaster relief, but President Donald Trump has dismantled the country's humanitarian aid agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington said on Friday it was adding US$7 million on top of an earlier US$2 million in assistance to Myanmar. (AFP)

    Manufacturers told to look for markets outside US

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The former president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has called on entrepreneurs to look for new markets away from the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries around the world. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Allen Shi said many manufacturers export goods to the US where there is a huge consumer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, we need to consider setting up in new markets such as the Middle East, Asean or the former Soviet states, or concentrating on domestic markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot just rely on the US market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Sunny Tan, who represents the textile and garment sector, said the industry felt powerless in the face of Washington's latest move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said manufacturers in the US would also suffer from the levies, as a lot of their low-value work is done overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, China said it would impose a 34 percent retaliatory tariff on all US imports from Thursday, in response of Trump's announcement.

    Housing Society to complete tenant checks in late 2026

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Housing Society on Saturday said it hopes to complete checks for well-off tenants by November of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The society introduced the "Well-Off Tenants Policy" in 2018. Last year, it was expanded to cover all households that signed new tenancy agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has already said it will start issuing new tenancy terms from September to the 25,000 households still awaiting checks. Housing Society chairman Ling Kar-kan said the new rental agreement says tenants must regularly declare their income and assets. He said those who refuse to sign must move out within four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ling said so far only a few tenants had been classed as being well off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the Well-Off Tenants Policy, it has already been implemented on those signing new tenancy agreements," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are about 4,000 households who have signed new terms and nine are well-off tenants. Among the nine, seven are paying 1.5 times the standard rent and the other two are paying twice the standard rent."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the society would discuss the new policy with households before September.

    Retaliatory tariffs on US goods 'aim to cause pain'

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said China's measures were not gestures. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799015_1_20250405103147.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank says China's retaliatory tariffs on the US aim to cause pain. Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said that given the difficult trade situation, China's retaliatory measures were not gestures, saying otherwise they would be meaningless.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Beijing announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on all US imports starting on April 10. The move was in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement on April 2 of a fresh round of tariffs targeting countries worldwide. They included a 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods in addition to the previous 20 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also made no distinction between goods coming from the SAR and the mainland. In response, Lau said - apart from imposing countermeasures on Washington should Beijing request such a move - Hong Kong could also consider placing levies on US goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, believes Beijing's latest round of tariffs will cause US stocks to fall further.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a recession would likely occur in the US in the next few quarters due to inflationary concerns and the reduction in GDP caused by a decline in consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the US might impose additional tariffs in response to Beijing's move, further reducing trade between the two countries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 NHL career goals on Friday, matching a mark that once seemed unassailable.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special," Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. "(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot," Ovechkin said. "Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys," he said with a nod to fans, "my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky," Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. "It hit the post and went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's buzzing right now," he said. "Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin's next chance to break the mark will come Sunday, when the Capitals play at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did break another record Friday, his 136th game-winning goal breaking the record he shared with Jaromir Jagr. (AFP)

    Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won both last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton," said the effervescent Pogacar. "Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace," Pogacar said. "He'll be in there on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for.
  <br>
  <br>
  First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is," said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship. (AFP)

    Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair

<img alt="Jerome Powell said on Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798991_1_20250405044209.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was "too soon" to consider changes to US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  "CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. "I fully intend to serve all of my term," he said during the Virginia event. (AFP)

    Major Wall Street indices fall by over 5 percent

<img alt="A trader on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798992_1_20250405045214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another bruising sell-off on Friday as major indices slumped more than five percent following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent the entire session in the red, shrugging off solid employment figures and fixating on China's quick retaliation against the US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 led the major indices lower, ending at 5,074.08, down 6.0 percent for the day and more than nine percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 5.8 percent to 15,587.79, placing it in a bear market, defined as a 20 percent fall from a recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.5 percent to 38,314.86, its first close under 40,000 points since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses increased somewhat following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation due to tariff increases he characterized as "significantly larger than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, government data showed the US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets focused on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've essentially got an escalating trade war," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "We're at the beginning of a global slowdown if these tariffs remain in place."
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell while the Dow index was overwhelmingly a sea of red, with Apple falling 7.3 percent, Chevron 8.2 percent and Boeing 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were a few equities that rebounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nike and Lululemon Athletica rose three percent or more after Trump spoke optimistically about trade talks with Vietnam, from which both companies import apparel. Clothing importers had been among the most hard-hit sectors on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homebuilders were another bright spot in light of falling mortgage rates as markets bet on easing monetary policy. Lennar rose 2.4 percent, while KB Home tacked on 3.5 percent. (AFP)

    Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer

<img alt="The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798987_1_20250405031437.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added on Friday that he would "continue working in good faith with China."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. "TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful," said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called "The People's Bid for TikTok", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Friday, shrugging off solid US hiring data and extending a rout after China retaliated in kind to President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices were stuck in the red, pointing to another brutal session after the S&P 500 on Thursday experienced its largest drop since 2020 following Trump's sweeping "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 15 minutes into trading, the broad-based S&P 500 was down 3.2 percent at 5,223.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slumped 2.8 percent to 39,412, while the Nasdaq 3.6 percent to 15,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated and significantly above February's revised 117,000 figure, said the Department of Labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets fixated on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his plan, saying on his Truth Social platform that "my policies will never change."

  Friday's trend marks a "continuation of the worry regarding the announcement of the US tariffs on Wednesday, combined with China's quicker-than-expected retaliatory tariffs," said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stovall said investors are ignoring the jobs data, in part because it could lead the Federal Reserve to "continue to remain on the sidelines" following talk that the weakened US outlook with tariffs might prompt the central bank to cut interest rates more quickly.

<img alt="President Trump says that last month he wrote to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to call for nuclear negotiations. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798967_1_20250404204544.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he wanted "direct talks" with Tehran on a nuclear deal, after he threatened to bomb Iran if it develops nuclear weapons.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has given Iran's leaders a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear programme, which has strained relations with Western nations for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of pursuing a nuclear weapon, which Tehran has denied, insisting its enrichment activities were solely for peaceful purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's better if we have direct talks," he told reporters onboard the presidential plane Air Force One.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it goes faster and you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said last week that Tehran would not engage in direct talks with Washington "until there is a change in the other side's approach towards the Islamic Republic."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump in his first term ripped up a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, sealed between Tehran and world powers, had required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They wanted to use intermediaries, I don't think that's necessarily true anymore," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they're concerned, I think they feel vulnerable. I don't want them to feel that way," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they want to meet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said last month he had written to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to call for nuclear negotiations and warn of possible military action if Tehran refused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khamenei responded by saying that US threats "will get them nowhere" and warned of reciprocal measures "if they do anything malign" against Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump last week said "there will be bombing" of Iran if it does not drop its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's outreach comes at a weak point for the Islamic Republic after Israel decimated two of its allies – Hamas, the Palestinian militants who attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne confirmed on Friday that he will leave the club at the end of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  De Bruyne, 33, has won 14 major trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here – and you deserve to hear it from me first," De Bruyne said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football led me to all of you - and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This City. This club. These people... gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what – we won everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian international has been instrumental in City's rise to the dominant force in English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was twice crowned players' player of the year in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 and is second in the Premier League's all-time standings for assists on 118.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract is due to expire at the end of June, but it remains unclear whether he will continue to see out his days as a City player at the Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 until July 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every story comes to an end, but this has definitely been the best chapter," De Bruyne added. "Let's enjoy these last moments together!" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States, as a countermeasure to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. That was on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Commerce, meanwhile, said China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), following the US slapping of what it called "reciprocal tariffs" on its trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said the move by the US seriously violated WTO rules and damaged the legitimate rights of WTO members, slamming the US for endangering the stability of the global economic and trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also said it had decided to add 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list, with immediate effect, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced controls on the export of seven rare earths, with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the nation's General Administration of Customs announced the suspension of import qualifications for six US companies. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump unveiled the first "gold card," a residency permit to be sold for US$5 million each, aboard Air Force One on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holding a prototype that bore his face and an inscription "The Trump Card," the Republican president told reporters that the special visa would probably be available "in less than two weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the first buyer," he said. "Pretty exciting, huh?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump previously said that sales of the new visa, a high-priced version of the traditional green card, would bring in job creators and could be used to reduce the US national deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate tycoon, who has made the deportation of millions of undocumented migrants a priority for his second term, said the new card would be a route to highly prized US citizenship.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said in February that his administration hoped to sell "maybe a million" of the cards and did not rule out that Russian oligarchs may be eligible. (AFP)

    Israel kills Hamas 'commander' in Lebanon strike

<img alt="The strike in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798944_1_20250404164812.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said it killed a commander of the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday in a strike in the Lebanese port city of Sidon that also killed his adult son and daughter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam condemned the strike as a "flagrant attack on Lebanese sovereignty" and a breach of the November 27 ceasefire with Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the (army and the domestic security agency Shin Bet) conducted a targeted strike in the Sidon area, eliminating the terrorist Hassan Farhat, commander of Hamas's western arena in Lebanon," the Israeli military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It alleged that Farhat had orchestrated multiple attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians during the hostilities that followed the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  They included rocket fire on the Israeli town of Safed on February 14, 2024, that killed an Israeli soldier, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike on a flat in a residential area of Sidon killed the official and his adult son and daughter, said a Palestinian official.
  <br>
  <br>
  A witness saw the fourth-floor flat still on fire after the strike, which caused heavy damage to the apartment block and neighbouring buildings and sparked panic in the densely populated neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese state media had reported the 3:45 am (0045 GMT) strike on Sidon, saying at least three people were killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hostile drone raided a residential apartment... causing two successive explosions that led to a fire and extensive damage," the state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers rushed to the scene where they recovered "the bodies of three martyrs," NNA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese prime minister called for "maximum pressure on Israel to force it to halt these continual attacks which target various districts, many of them residential areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel struck south Beirut earlier this week, killing a Hezbollah Palestinian liaison officer in only the second raid on the capital since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese health ministry reported four dead in that strike, including a woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese leaders condemned the attack, but Israel said it was in response to recent unclaimed rocket fire that Hezbollah insists it had no hand in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah spiralled into all-out conflict last September, and the group remains a target of Israeli air strikes despite the November 27 ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the truce, Hezbollah is supposed to redeploy its forces north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel is supposed to withdraw its forces across the UN-demarcated Blue Line, the de facto border, but has missed two deadlines to do so and continues to hold five positions it deems "strategic." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the National Games test events – the Hong Kong International Track Cup – will be held from April 19 to 21, attracting professional cyclists from around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event will be held at the Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O, involving about 150 cyclists from over ten countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the organising committee, Steve Nip, said it is also the first time that 50 cyclists from local affiliated clubs will be invited to participate in elite and junior races.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Audiences can enjoy races involving world-class cyclists, and also cheer for cyclists from local affiliated clubs. I hope they can achieve good results with the advantage of racing at their home track," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, the vice president of the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China, also expressed hope for local cyclists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides the opportunity for the Hong Kong team and young cyclists from local affiliated clubs to showcase their skills," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public can also watch races of a high standard, and they can treat this as a warm-up for the National Games at the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR cyclist Ceci Lee, who will participate in the race, said she will step up training in the coming two weeks, especially on her sprinting skills, and she hopes she can achieve good results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local cyclist, Mow Ching-yin expects his condition to improve gradually as it is getting closer to the National Games, and he said he will focus on improving his endurance and speed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard tickets for the Track Cup can be had for HK$50, while a concession ticket costs HK$30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea discovered and seized two tons of cocaine hidden aboard a Norwegian-flagged vessel, authorities said on Friday, marking the country's largest drug bust to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Korea Coast Guard said they had found "two tons" of what they suspect to be pure cocaine on a Norwegian-flagged vessel which had departed from Mexico and made stops in Ecuador, Panama, and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operation was launched after South Korean authorities received intelligence from US agencies – the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – that the vessel was carrying hidden narcotics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korea Coast Guard and Korea Customs Service coordinated a large-scale search operation "consisting of a joint search team of 90 officers... along with two drug-sniffing dog units," the Korea Coast Guard said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the vessel docked at an east coast port in South Korea, the team immediately boarded the vessel and "discovered a hidden compartment behind the ship's engine room."
  <br>
  <br>
  The drugs were packed in 56 sacks, each holding some 30 to 40 kilogrammes of the drug, authorities said, bringing the total haul to around two tons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preliminary field tests confirmed the substances as suspected cocaine," the Korea Coast Guard official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The seizure is the largest in history, about five times bigger than the previous record, which was 404 kilogrammes of methamphetamine," said a Korea Customs Service official.
  <br>
  <br>
  The estimated street value is one trillion won (US$697 million), he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have launched a joint investigation team to question the vessel's captain and crew about the origin and intended destination of the drugs, and the route used to transport them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators also said they are looking into potential ties to international drug trafficking syndicates and will expand cooperation with the FBI and HSI.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has long ranked among the countries with low drug use globally, thanks to its strict laws and strong social stigma. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting "you don't know what you're doing" at the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants.
  <br>
  <br>
  For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot. (AFP)

 The Secretary for Sports, Culture and Tourism emphasised that she will stay principled and innovative in her work, as she wrapped up her three-day trip to Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marking her first visit to Beijing since becoming the tourism chief four months ago, Rosanna Law revealed that Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, has offered his encouragement to her staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The director was particularly focused on how we can be innovative in the aspect of tourism, particularly our islands and coasts, we can make good use of such valuable, rich tourism resources," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have been working on that in the short, medium, and even the long-term."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that the Development Bureau is inviting expressions of interest for coastal and island tourism projects on Lamma Island and Lantau Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the trip as "very fruitful," the minister said she has reported to Xia and the General Administration of Sport of China on a series of mega events staged at the Kai Tak Sports Park after its opening in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included the Hong Kong Sevens, for which Law said the feedback from revellers coming outside the SAR and athletes was generally positive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She emphasised that the government has to continue to fulfill its role in leading and monitoring the Kai Tak venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, meanwhile, noted that the current situation for Hong Kong's film industry is challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the overall economic situation might have caused some cinemas to shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourism chief added the industry should grab hold of the opportunities on the mainland offered by the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, or CEPA.

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on Friday flocked to cemeteries to pay their respects to their ancestors as part of tradition for the Ching Ming Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a cemetery in Diamond Hill, police have controlled traffic flow on certain roads to maintain order.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said the crowd was smaller than expected, and the weather was suitable for tomb sweeping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many people here. I normally come in the morning. There's wind and it's not too sunny," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  People also bought paper offerings to cemeteries, but one man said they cost more than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These cost me HK$400. It's ten percent more than last year. But this is the tradition. We use these to pay respects to our ancestors. It's not about the money. It's about our intention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A shopkeeper said business was better than expected, and there had been people buying paper offerings at his shop since a month ago.

    Five men arrested in relation to child pornography

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said five local men were arrested in relation to child pornography, as officers warned about AI-generated pornographic images.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said five local men, aged between 16 and 49, were arrested last week on suspicion of producing and possessing child pornography, and obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said hundreds of videos and photos related to child pornography were found in the suspects' electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said pornographic images were found in a 16-year-old suspect's mobile phone, in which he was believed to have filmed his 11-year-old sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police clinical psychologist, Fung Ho-kin, said that police, schools and parents need to work together more to prevent this from happening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should, and they do, provide education to students as in what behaviour is acceptable on the internet and what is not," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they are doing workshops in some schools to teach their students how they should respond or how they should behave when they are faced with threats, including internet bullying or sexual exploitation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said there were 80 cases in Hong Kong related to child pornography last year, and about 80 percent of the cases were in relation to online activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said in a joint operation with authorities in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, a total of 435 people were arrested over the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said some cases in other countries were found to involve AI-generated pornographic images, and officers warned that producing content involving child pornography electronically is also a crime.

    HK manufacturers to wait-and-see amid Trump tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has voiced its strong opposition towards US President Donald Trump's latest round of levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were part of sweeping tariffs by the Republican leader directed at countries around the world on Thursday, including 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Friday, association chairman Wingco Lo pointed out that the move has affected the stability of global supply chains, and has damaged the international trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of variables and uncertainties, so manufacturers do not dare to move when it comes to planning, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will wait and see what the US is going to do. Because its policies often keep changing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that US firms and importers are also adopting a wait-and-see approach, and they might suspend placing an order, or doing it later than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short-run, there might be a shock effect on trade activities, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders and businesses have expressed shock and concern by Trump's tariff barrage, with many markets taking a similar stance of not making any major moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lo believes the imposition of tariffs are Trump's bargaining chip and will not last long.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because Washington itself will also suffer from the move, especially its importers, ports, as well as retailers, according to Lo, and the measure would step up inflation and reduce consumer purchasing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong manufacturers are encouraged to open up new markets, and set up production lines in places with low, or even no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, told the same programme that while he anticipates the SAR's trade industry to suffer losses due to the levies, he expects the impact to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The situation will get better when people adapt to the reciprocal tariffs, he added.

    South Korea court upholds President Yoon's impeachment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court on Friday decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliament's impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the country's worst political crisis in decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon's ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the country's constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on January 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crisis was triggered by Yoon's December 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out "anti-state" elements and the opposition Democratic Party's alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoon's martial law declaration will now be eased by the court ruling. (Reuters)

    Canada imposing 25% tariff on some US auto imports

<img alt="Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks about tariffs at a press conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798895_1_20250404084801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada said it would impose a 25 percent tariff on tens of thousands of vehicles imported from the United States, retaliating against US President Donald Trump's levies that came into effect on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Mark Carney announced "25 percent tariffs on all vehicles imported from the United States that are not compliant with CUSMA," using the Canadian acronym for an existing North American free trade agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs on US$25.3 billion worth of US vehicles are to come into force in the coming days, his office told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian tariffs will impact cars and light trucks that are made with less than 75 percent North American parts, roughly 10 percent of all vehicles shipped from the United States to Canada, or about 67,000 vehicles annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada was largely spared from the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced on Wednesday, as Washington granted an exemption to goods compliant with the US-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement, which covers most products.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Canada, which is one of America's largest trading partners, is still facing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products, in addition to the levies on automobiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said Trump's trade war "will rupture the global economy."

  "The system of global trade anchored in the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of the Second World War... is over," Carney said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect, championed the free and open exchange of goods and services is over," he added, calling the development "a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ottawa has previously imposed retaliatory tariffs on US$21 billion worth of US consumer goods and nearly US$21 billion of US steel and aluminum imports into Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney and Trump spoke by phone last week. They agreed Washington and Ottawa should negotiate the future of bilateral trade after Canada's April 28 election. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street led a global markets bloodbath on Thursday as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's trade war, while the White House insisted the US economy will emerge victorious.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 4.8 percent in its biggest loss since 2020. The tech-rich Nasdaq plummeted 6.0 percent and the Dow Jones 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shock waves also tore through markets in Asia and Europe in the wake of Trump's Wednesday announcement, while foreign leaders signaled readiness to negotiate but also threatened counter-tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump slapped 10 percent import duties on all nations and far higher levies on imports from dozens of specific countries, including top trade partners China and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate tariffs of 25 percent on all foreign-made cars also went into effect and Canada swiftly responded with a similar levy on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat, paused production at some Canadian and Mexican assembly plants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump dismissed the turmoil, insisting to reporters as he left for a weekend at his Florida golf resorts, that stocks will "boom."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old president says he wants to make the United States free from reliance on foreign manufacturers, in a massive economic reshaping that he likened to a medical procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's what is expected," he said of the market reaction. "The patient was very sick. The economy had a lot of problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went through an operation. It's going to be a booming economy. It's going to be amazing." (AFP)

<img alt="People and Palestinian rescuers run for cover as Israeli strike hits a school in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798885_1_20250404052856.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death of 15 medics and humanitarian workers in Gaza after shots were fired at their ambulances raises further concerns of "war crimes by the Israeli army," the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am appalled by the recent killings of 15 medical personnel and humanitarian aid workers, which raise further concerns over the commission of war crimes by the Israeli military," said Volker Turk, before the UN Security Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turk called for an "independent, prompt and thorough investigation" into the March 23 incident that Israeli officials have claimed was an attack on "terrorists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of 15 rescuers and humanitarian workers, including eight from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one from the UN, were found near Rafah in what the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called a "mass grave."
  <br>
  <br>
  OCHA had said on Tuesday that the first team was killed by Israeli forces on March 23, and that other emergency and aid teams were struck one after another for several hours as they searched for their missing colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the darkest moments in this conflict that has shaken our shared humanity to its core," said the president of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society Younes Al-Khatib before the UN Security Council on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The souls of Mostafa, Ezzedine, Saleh, Riffat, Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-heila, Ashraf and Raed are asking for justice. Can you hear them?" he asked, demanding to know the fate of a 16th team member still missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's worth noting, also, that during the communication with the team, the dispatch could hear a conversation in Hebrew between the Israeli forces and the team, meaning some were alive, still alive, when they were under the control of the Israeli forces," Al-Khatib said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army has indicated it is investigating the "incident of March 23, 2025," while claiming its soldiers had fired at "terrorists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Turk also condemned Israel for blocking the entry of humanitarian aid for a month and resuming its military operations, saying "the blockade and siege of Gaza," and the subsequent suffering of civilians "constitutes a form of collective punishment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It "may also amount to the use of starvation as a method of war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turk expressed alarm over "inflammatory statements by senior Israeli officials about seizing, dividing, and controlling the territory of the Gaza Strip."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of this raises serious concerns about international crimes being committed and contradicts the fundamental principle of international law regarding acquisition of territory by force." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets and the dollar tumbled on Thursday after President Donald Trump's latest tariffs salvo against countries worldwide, fanning a trade war that many fear will spark recession and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dollar slumped by as much as 2.6 percent versus the euro, its biggest intraday plunge in a decade, and suffered sharp losses also against the yen and British pound.
  <br>
  <br>
  On stock markets, Wall Street's main indices opened sharply lower, with the Nasdaq falling more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The simultaneous decline in both stocks and the US dollar speaks volumes about investor confidence in Trump's trade policy," said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in apparel companies, which rely on cheap labour in factories abroad, with Nike sinking 11 percent and Gap shedding 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the globe, shares in major sectors including auto, luxury and banking also took big hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed by more than four percent, and the Paris stock market led losses in Europe as it fell over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices plummeted around seven percent to under US$70 per barrel as an economic downturn would hit demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold, a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 an ounce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on government bonds, another haven investment, fell as investors fled risky assets. (AFP)

<img alt="The SAR government says it'll take actions to defend the city's legitimate rights. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798851_1_20250403202459.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has expressed strong disapproval and discontent over the United States for imposing a fresh round of tariffs and cancelling a duty-free exemption on small parcels.
 <br>
  <br>
  It called on Washington to withdraw the “bullying” measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also signed an executive order to cancel a trade exemption known as "de minimis", which allows low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the country free of duties, from May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's measures are bullying and unreasonable, and grossly inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, willfully undermining the multilateral trading system which is the cornerstone for international trade," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once again, the government firmly requests the US to withdraw its so-called reciprocal tariff measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to changes to the "de minimis" exemption, the administration said Hongkong Post will temporarily maintain postal services to the US without collecting any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has been repeatedly changing its policies unilaterally. Hongkong Post has requested the postal administration of the US to promptly clarify the matter and should not cause inconvenience to the public," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also pledged to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US that are inconsistent with fair trade, saying it will defend the city's legitimate interests by, for example, filing a complaint to the WTO.

    Australia records hottest 12 months ever

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has just sweltered through its hottest 12 months on record, a weather official said on Thursday, a period of drenching floods, tropical cyclones and mass coral bleaching.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior government climatologist Simon Grainger said the rolling 12-month period between April 2024 and March 2025 was 1.61 degrees Celsius above average – the hottest since records began more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is certainly part of a sustained global pattern," Grainger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been seeing temperatures since about April 2023 that were globally much warmer than anything we have seen in the global historical record."
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest period was in 2019, he added, when temperatures were 1.51 degrees Celsius above average.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is a pretty significant difference," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's well above what we would expect just from uncertainties due to rounding. The difference is much larger than that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The record was measured on a rolling 12-month basis, rather than as a calendar year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia has also recorded its hottest-ever March, Grainger said, with temperatures more than two degrees above what would normally be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has basically been sustained warmth through pretty much all of Australia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of heatwave conditions, particularly in Western Australia. And we didn't really see many periods of cool weather – we didn't see many cold fronts come through." (AFP)

    Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Viktor Orban (left). Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798838_1_20250403185544.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called "brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it "was never made part of Hungarian law," meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions," Orban said on X in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court," Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued. (Reuters)

 The United States is the sole bidder for the 2031 Women's World Cup, and the United Kingdom is set to host the 2035 tournament, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Uefa Congress in Belgrade, Infantino said the only bid for 2031 was "from the USA and potentially some other Concacaf members together, and 2035 is from Europe, from the home nations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino also said Fifa planned to increase the number of participating teams at the Women's World Cup from 32 teams to 48 in time for the 2031 tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's announcement comes after the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed last month that they would submit an expression of interest in staging the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  World football's governing body last month said it would only welcome bids for 2035 from Europe or Africa, saying that the identity of the hosts would be confirmed at a Fifa Congress in the second quarter of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States – who are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada the 2026 men's World Cup – also confirmed in early March that it would push ahead with a bid for 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Morocco had also been in the running with African nations invited to bid too, but Infantino's comments suggest they are now out of the running.
