<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but pointed to increased economic uncertainty, while Treasury bond yields tumbled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fed's interest rate decision was expected, but the central bank cut its growth forecast for 2025 and hiked its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has nonetheless still penciled in two rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But yields on the 10-year US Treasury note, a closely-watched proxy of monetary policy, fell sharply as the Fed also slowed the pace at which it will shrink the size of its balance sheet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,964.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 5,675, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to 17,750.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Uncertainty today is unusually elevated," Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision was published, adding that at least part of a recent inflation uptick was related to the White House tariff policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Powell also communicated some confidence about the US economic outlook, noting key indicators that have stayed solid in spite of surveys showing weakening consumer confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the market liked hearing the Fed Chair sound reasonably upbeat about the economy," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who noted that the drop in Treasury yields boosts expectations that mortgage rates also will fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing jumped 6.8 percent as CFO Brian West told a Wall Street conference the company's efforts to improve plane assembly operations were on track so far in the first quarter and struck an upbeat tone on the company's outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Mills fell 2.1 percent after reporting a five percent drop in sales as it pointed to a slowdown in demand for snacking and a drop in orders from retailers managing inventories. (AFP)

    Trump suggests US takeover of Ukraine's power plants

<img alt='The White House said that during the call Trump (Left) had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump hailed a "very good" call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on Kyiv's power plants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said efforts to secure a full ceasefire in Russia's three-year-old war remained "on track," despite the fact that his call with Putin failed to produce any broader peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing attacks, Zelensky said after the "frank" call that Ukraine was ready to pause strikes on both Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he spoke for around an hour with his Ukrainian counterpart, their first conversation since they had a blazing televised row in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very much on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House later said that during the call Trump had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate mogul has already pushed Kyiv into a deal to give the United States preferential access to its critical mineral resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also pledged to help Ukraine get more air defense equipment from Europe, a statement from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while Ukraine has already agreed to a US plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Putin is still refusing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin leader insisted during his call with Trump that a full ceasefire was only possible if the West halts its billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv – Moscow's long-standing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also demanded Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm, and that it must halt mandatory mobilisation. (AFP)

    Malaysia agrees terms for resumption of MH370 search

<img alt="Very little of the doomed Malaysian Airlines plane has ever been found. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796487_1_20250319224244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia has agreed to the terms and conditions of an agreement with exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, its transport minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014 in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision will enable commencement of seabed search operations in a new location estimated to cover 15,000 sq km (5,790 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean, based on a "no find, no fee" principle, minister Loke Siew Fook said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity will receive US$70 million if the wreckage is successfully located, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers," Loke said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government in December said it had agreed in principle with Ocean Infinity's proposal to resume the hunt for MH370. The firm had conducted the last search for the plane that ended in 2018 but failed on two attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those followed an underwater search by Malaysia, Australia and China in a 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the data of automatic connections between an Inmarsat satellite and the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ship that will look for the missing plane was deployed to its Indian Ocean search zone late last month, ship tracking data showed, even though a deal had yet to be signed with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how long the search contract with Ocean Infinity would be. Loke had previously said it would cover an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the King's Park site, currently home to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, will be retained for healthcare purposes despite a relocation plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most clinical inpatient services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, including the accident and emergency department, will gradually move to the New Acute Hospital in Kai Tak starting early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ambulatory Care Centre will remain at the current King's Park site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said officials have no plan to convert the site for purposes other than healthcare at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the convenient geographical location, it will be a feasible option to consider the expansion of the ambulatory care services at the King's Park site based on the demand of the population in Kowloon," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that health officials will consider the future use and development plan of the King's Park site when they review the Second Hospital Development Plan.

 Israel's resumption of strikes on the Gaza Strip is a major step in the wrong direction after its ceasefire with Palestinian militant group Hamas earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes…despite the efforts of mediators, represents a dramatic step backwards," Macron said ahead of talks in Paris with Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's dramatic for the Palestinians of Gaza, who are again plunged into the terror of bombardment, and dramatic for the [Israeli] hostages and their families who live in the nightmare of uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel earlier this week carried out its deadliest bombing of Gaza since a fragile ceasefire began in January between Israel and the Palestinian territory's Islamist rulers Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli air strikes in the night of Monday to Tuesday killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. They have continued since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron slammed Hamas, saying the "axis of resistance is today an illusion", but also warned Israel that there could be "no Israeli military solution in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jordanian king called the strikes "an extremely dangerous step that adds further devastation to an already dire humanitarian situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire must be restored and the flow of aid must resume immediately," Abdullah said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the war stops, France has thrown its support behind a plan put forward by Arab nations, including Jordan, to rebuild Gaza without evicting its 2.4 million Palestinian residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We French and Europeans are ready to contribute to these deliberations and to this plan," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said he and other European leaders would discuss it on Thursday at the European Council, "among ourselves and with the Secretary General of the United Nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain, Germany and Italy earlier this month backed the plan, hailing it as a "realistic path" for Gaza to return to the control of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority after nearly two decades of Hamas rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have rejected the proposal. (AFP)

    UK teen who planned school massacre gets 49 years

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A UK teenager who killed three family members and planned to outdo notorious US massacres to become "the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century" was on Wednesday jailed for a minimum of 49 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Prosper, 18 at the time of the killings, used a shotgun to kill his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle, 13, and brother Kyle, 16, who also received more than 100 knife wounds, at their home in Luton, southern England, in September 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century," Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said on Wednesday as she sentenced the now 19-year-old Prosper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper told police upon his arrest of his "Friday the 13th" plan to kill four-year-old pupils and two teachers at a nearby primary school, and then himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his aim was to conduct an attack more deadly than the US Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech massacres, but the plan was interrupted when his mother woke up before he could kill his family in their sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  The noisy struggle alerted neighbours, who called the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You explicitly sought to emulate and outdo Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old American who shot dead 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut in 2012," the judge said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You aimed for 34 deaths, one more than the deadliest school shooting of recent times in the United States of America, at Virginia Tech in 2007," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper, who experts said showed symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), was handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 49 years. Taking into account the time already served, he will serve a minimum of 48 years and 177 days. (AFP)

    Ohtani hits home run as Dodgers sweep Cubs in Tokyo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani hit a home run but Roki Sasaki had a wobbly Major League Baseball debut as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 in Tokyo on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Ohtani thrilled another sold-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome when he blasted a one-run shot in the fifth inning as the World Series champion Dodgers completed a two-game season-opening sweep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese pitcher Sasaki showcased his ferocious fastball but struggled with his command in his first start since joining the Dodgers over the winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old hit 60 kph with his first three pitches and struck out three batters but also gave up five walks in three innings on the mound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Edman and Kike Hernandez also hit home runs for the Dodgers, who beat the Cubs 4-1 in Tuesday's Game 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 40,000 fans erupted when Ohtani hit a home run to right centre field in his third trip to the plate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The call was reviewed but eventually upheld, giving fans an excuse to celebrate a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs walked Ohtani at his next at-bat, prompting loud boos from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is a national hero in Japan and his first visit with the Dodgers has been eagerly anticipated for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were also waiting to see the hotly tipped Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed in Japan's 2011 tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander got his first MLB strikeout against the Cubs' Japanese batter Seiya Suzuki, letting out a loud grunt as he launched another thunderous fastball.
  <br>
  <br>
  His command faltered as the game went on and he walked three batters in a row in the third inning before getting himself out of trouble with two straight strikeouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edman hit the Dodgers' first home run of the season off Cubs starting pitcher Justin Steele in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hernandez crushed another in the fourth inning, hitting the ball high into the stands with a massive shot. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sixty-six taxi drivers have been slapped with demerit points for overcharging, refusing passengers and not taking the most direct route under a new penalty points system that was implemented around half a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  But none of them have racked up the 15 penalty points or more needed to be disqualified from working.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system – aimed at targeting taxi driver malpractice – came into effect on September 22 and covers 11 offences including overcharging and driving an indirect route. Penalty points are meted out to taxi drivers who commit any of the offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabbies would also be ordered to take a driver improvement course if they get 10 points or more within two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until March 9, 2025, 66 taxi drivers incurred points under the [taxi-driver-offence points] system," said transport chief Mable Chan in a written response to the Legislative Council on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant offences committed include overcharging, refusing to accept a hire or driving to a destination other than by the most direct practicable route."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan revealed that five taxi drivers incurred three points, 12 received five points and 49 accumulated 10 points since the system came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, no taxi driver is liable to disqualification from driving a taxi due to incurrence of 15 or more points," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To further improve taxi services in Hong Kong, the minister said officials are looking to introduce the proposed legislative amendments in the second quarter of this year on requiring taxis to install in-vehicle cameras, dash cams and global navigation satellite systems.

<img alt="Tencent posts strong fourth quarter financial performances, bolstered by its gaming and advertising businesses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796452_1_20250319182448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Tencent on Wednesday reported a stronger than expected fourth-quarter growth, boosted by a surge in gaming and advertising revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which is the largest video game company in the world, and also the operator of WeChat, saw its revenue grow by 11 percent year on year to 172.4 billion yuan (US$23.83 billion) for the quarter ending in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was much higher compared with the 168.9 billion yuan expected by the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit, meanwhile, was up 90 percent year on year to 51.3 billion yuan during the three month period, also higher than the expected 46.03 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The growth came as its gaming business regained momentum and showed robust recovery since mid-2024, with its domestic gaming revenue rising by 23 percent year on year to 33.2 billion yuan and its global gaming revenue climbing 15 percent to 16 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said the increases were due to a low base from the previous year, as well as growth in some of its hit games including "Honour of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite".
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful launches of its new games such as "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" and "Delta Force" as well as regulatory easing over the nation's gaming sector also helped bolster its growth, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the full year of 2024, the Shenzhen-headquartered firm registered a profit growth of 68 percent year on year to 194 billion yuan, while revenue grew by eight percent year on year to 660 billion yuan, meeting market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also attributed artificial intelligence technology as a driving force to improve its various products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Starting a few months ago, we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products,” Tencent said in its earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe these stepped-up investments will generate ongoing returns via uplifting productivity in our advertising business and longevity of our games, as well as longer term value from accelerated consumer usage of our AI applications and enterprise adoption of our AI services," the firm added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company proposed a final dividend of HK$4.5 per share for the year, marking a 32 percent rise from a year earlier.

    New law passed to protect infrastructure cybersecurity

<img alt="Chris Tang stressed the new law won't affect people's personal information or confidential business information." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796453_1_20250319181710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that aims to protect the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure in several sectors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new law will cover facilities delivering "essential services" in banking, financial and healthcare services, information technology as well as communications and broadcasting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also apply to important equipment for the energy, land transport, air transport and maritime sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operators of important socioeconomic facilities, such as major sports and performance venues and science parks, are also subject to the new legislation, which is due to come into effect at the start of next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new commissioner's office under the Security Bureau will be set up to monitor operators and follow up on non-compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operators need to set up units protecting cybersecurity, regularly conduct drills and risk assessments, and report incidents within a designated time frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those who fail to fulfil their responsibilities are subject to a fine of up to HK$5 million if convicted after trial, and a daily penalty of up to HK$100,000 if the lapses continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security chief Chris Tang sought to reassure the public that the law won't affect people's personal information or confidential business information.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it is there to protect infrastructure that are essential for people to live their normal, everyday life.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulated operators are those that are necessary for the continuous delivery of essential services or maintaining important societal and economic activities in Hong Kong," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are mostly large organisations and small and medium enterprises, and the general public will not be regulated or affected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Commerce-sector lawmaker Martin Liao said the bill should be regarded as an indispensable part of local laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cybersecurity is a key part of national security. For our national security, this bill is crucial," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Keeping the computer systems of critical infrastructure safe will strengthen Hong Kong's resilience and safety, and that will enhance our international image."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairwoman of the bill's committee, Election Committee sector councillor Carmen Kan, said the frequent number of cybersecurity issues in recent years show the law's necessity.

<img alt="Supporters and municipality workers hold a rally in Istanbul in support of mayor Ekrem Imamoglu following his arrest. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796448_1_20250319175032.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey's lira fell 12.7 percent and touched a new all-time low of 42 to the dollar on Wednesday, with bonds and stocks also tumbling sharply, after authorities detained President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was expected to be named as the main opposition's presidential candidate within days, faces charges including corruption and aiding a terrorist group. The currency traded at 39.3 to the dollar at one stage, from a close of 36.67 on Tuesday, having recovered somewhat from the record low it hit earlier on Wednesday in what looked set to be its largest absolute daily move on record. Turkey's international government bonds also came under pressure with longer-dated maturities suffering the sharpest falls. The 2045 maturity slipped 1.5 cents to be bid at 85.13 cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Turkey this morning, bonds and FX are coming under pressure after a potential presidential candidate, the mayor of Istanbul, was arrested," said Frantisek Taborsky, EMEA FX & fixed income strategist at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Turkey's lira] is the most heavily positioned carry-trade in the emerging markets space at the moment in our view, and a sharp move could potentially lead to further outflows. On the other hand, we should see local banks providing some FX support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also crashed, reflecting investor worries over rule of law. Borsa Istanbul said trading was halted temporarily after the main BIST 100 index fell 6.87 percent in early trading and the market-wide circuit breaker was triggered.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BIST 100 index was down 4.97  percent at one stage while the banking sub-index declined 7.57 percent after trading resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A wave of selling was triggered after Imamoglu's diploma was annulled and he was detained. There have been foreign investor inflows in recent days...but political uncertainty currently prevails and concerns about foreign investors leaving the country have increased," Serhat Baskurt, algorithmic operations manager at ALB Yatırım, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baskurt said he expected the decline on the stock exchange to continue over the coming days. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Wednesday launched its first community living room on Hong Kong Island, with the Shau Kei Wan facility expected to serve households from more than 300 subdivided flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the new space – the fifth such facility in the territory – is fully equipped with amenities such as a kitchen and massage chairs. He also pointed out that social workers will provide homework assistance there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at the opening ceremony, Chan expressed the hope that families would visit the community living room regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope this additional living space can become a second home for our friends living in subdivided flats, transforming their homes into just bedrooms," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through spending their daily lives here, I believe it will greatly help both their living needs and emotional well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the 2,700-square-foot area is expected to serve 330 subdivided unit tenants and attract around 50,000 visits a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new space along with the four existing community living rooms, will support more than 2,000 subdivided flat households and handle 320,000 visits annually.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief secretary added that the success of community living rooms is based on cooperation between the government, the business sector and non-profit organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Chan revealed that another community living room will open next month on Ko Shan Road, with three more being planned in Prince Edward, Sham Shui Po, and Kowloon City.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief secretary also said officials will report the consultation results on the proposed regulatory regime for Basic Housing Units to the Legislative Council at the end of this month. They hope to table the bill by the middle of the year and pass it within 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources say authorities plan to require those who want to register for Basic Housing Units to avoid signing new leases for a specified period until their flats are renovated and certified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan brushed aside questions on whether the move would leave some subdivided flat tenants homeless, saying that the government aims to provide a suitable living environment for residents.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said on Wednesday cable car services and facilities in its upper section resumed operations at about 4 pm after they had to be closed down for more than half a day.
 <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the park said the cable car services had been suspended due to signalling problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there were no transport services between the upper and lower sections as the Ocean Express was undergoing an annual inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the park announced in a statement later in the day that all services resumed at 4.15 pm and called for understanding from visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from Guangzhou who said he had high expectations of Ocean Park was a bit disappointed by the closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK he decided to go elsewhere due to the suspension of cable car services and upper park facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to go in. But staff told us many facilities are closed. There are no cable cars, and some rollercoaster rides are suspended. We will go to another attraction, the Peak," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another visitor said he and his family decided to enter the park because it was his son's birthday, and he hopes there will be compensation for visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's his birthday and I don't want him to be disappointed. We're just unlucky. We hope Ocean Park will provide us with cash coupons, maybe worth about HK$100, because we cannot enjoy some of the facilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department has asked Ocean Park to submit a report on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it sent staff to the scene after receiving a report from the park at about 12.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the park found problems with the cable car's rollers during a routine check, which led to the service shutdown.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An employment survey has found that about 30 percent of Hong Kong companies are planning to hire more staff in the coming three months, while about 20 percent of them are expected to have personnel cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The survey, conducted by global employment agency ManpowerGroup, took in 525 local employers among the 39,449 surveyed globally in 42 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also showed that half of the surveyed local firms do not have plans to change their total employee numbers, but notable was a gauge measuring Hong Kong's hiring outlook that was significantly lower than that of the global average.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Net Employment Outlook (NEO) for the SAR stood at plus 11 percent for the coming quarter, up 0.5 percent from the previous quarter but notably lower compared with the plus 25 percent seen for the global job market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Lancy Chui, ManpowerGroup Greater China's senior vice president, said the local healthcare and life science industries have shown the strongest hiring demand, with its NEO index standing at plus 31 percent.

  <br>
  "The outstanding performance was mainly driven by government-led healthcare reforms and [increased] public health awareness. Smart medical technologies are [also] driving the industry's transformation, creating strong demand for biotechnology researchers, health management specialists and medical technology professionals," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The human resources veteran also noted that the information and technology (I&T) sector also showed strong interest in hiring, with the industry's NEO gauge standing at plus 27 percent, boosted by rapid developments in the artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our global data shows that 48 percent of employers are already using AI tools and another 21 of them are planning to adopt them in the next 12 months. These technologies not only enhance efficiency and productivity but also create a sharp rise in demand for AI professionals, especially data scientists and cyber security experts," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Chui warned about the increased challenges facing the logistics industry, as the NEO gauge for the sector stood at minus 25 percent, caused by the global trade frictions and US tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the firm noted that local firms are "cautiously optimistic" about their salary offerings amid expectations that pay rises for staff will only be around three percent for this year, 0.3 percentage points lower compared with last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While professionals in the tech and healthcare sectors could get a handsome pay rise, the construction, retail, and catering sectors could face a slower wage growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Workers who switch jobs could get a pay rise between 10 to 15 percent, but about one fifth of surveyed employers noted they might consider pay freezes or pay cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's jobless rate, meanwhile, is expected to stay in a range of about 3.1 to 3.3 percent, Chui added.

 A stable, healthy and sustainable China-US economic and trade relationship is in the fundamental interest of both countries, and also benefits global companies, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen told PepsiCo Chairman Ramon Laguarta in their meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang said bilateral economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature during their talks on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce Ministry, the two exchanged views on topics such as China-US economic and trade ties, as well as PepsiCo's operations in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said a series of policy measures introduced by Beijing to expand domestic demand and promote consumption will provide more opportunities for foreign firms investing in China, including PepsiCo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laguarta, for his part, said his company is committed to playing a constructive role in advancing healthy and stable China-US ties. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Snooker tournament slips spur Rugby Sevens resolve

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports chief Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that parties involved in the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament to be held later this month have to liaise and communicate closely for the Kai Tak event to be considered a success.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual extravaganza is moving to the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, having been held at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law's reassurance came after lawmakers in a Legislative Council meeting asked why officials, the sports park and organisers of a snooker tournament earlier this month had come up with different versions about wrong information given out to people at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Tse cited incidents where spectators were told they had to leave before midnight and a sign wrongly showed that there was a "curfew" in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the tournament as "a Cinderella event," Tse said it's important for authorities to clean up their act at the Sevens for a better fan experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien expressed concern over whether the government could get the sports park to have a designated spokesperson in time for the Sevens, which will kick off in less than 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Law said the park is actively looking into this and that officials are paying close attention in a bid to minimise the risks of problems popping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The organisers and government departments will have to work hand in hand. This is no exception. On top of that, this is a new venue. We need enhanced communications," she told the lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sports commissioner, permanent secretaries and I myself are all involved. We have been in close communication with the operator. We want the Rugby Sevens to be a successful event."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports minister also responded to lawmaker Yang Wing-kit's concern over transportation measures for spectators when events end late or overrun, saying arrangements will be in place to tackle these scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  A catering association had earlier complained that it was unable to host a bar culture festival in Kai Tak during the tournament, saying it didn't have enough time to obtain licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the administration is willing to streamline procedures and offer as much help to different parties as possible when it comes to hosting mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed the authorities never received a formal application, and that she personally checked and found that had the association applied, there would have been enough time for a licence to be approved.

    HK men's rugby squad unfazed by pressure at Sevens

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men’s rugby team on Wednesday said they are looking forward to feed off the energy from the home crowd when the Rugby Sevens are held for the first time later this month at Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad is looking to defend their title in the Melrose Claymores competition – a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Peter Jericevich says he is confident his players can use last year’s success as fuel to deliver on the SAR's biggest sporting stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, he warned his squad not to let their guard down ahead of their opening match against team China on March 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to achieve that last year," Jericevich said. "The key thing now is that first game. That's all we're really thinking about right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't look too far ahead. Right now, it's about making sure we prepare well this week and how we can ensure we're accurate in the key areas of our game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added home support will provide a major boost to his side's mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I really like about the new stadium is that it feels really close to the pitch. There's a lot of energy that we can definitely use. Sevens is a tough game since you're under fatigue very quickly when you're out there, so the home crowd behind us will hopefully drive us to perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Christie, the captain of the team, said he will draw on the personal experience from the past two editions of the Sevens to lead the young up-and-coming players on the squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can tell them how [the Sevens] was before and how it felt," Christie said after an open training session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all help each other out and talk to each other," he added. "If any of the new guys need anything, we'll be there for them. On the field we hope to just play the way we want to play, and the rest of the team will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, who was appointed captain in September, also noted the team will be looking to feed off the home crowd’s energy at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we couldn't hear anything because the crowd was super loud," recalled Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You just got to embrace it and enjoy, because it only comes around once a year."

    PolyU 'to shoulder cost of third medical school'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Wednesday said it will shoulder the cost of developing Hong Kong's third medical school when necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  The publicly-funded university in Hung Hom is among three candidates that have submitted proposals to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned medical school, along with a teaching and research hospital, is expected to be located in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam Tai-fai, the university's council chairman, said in a press conference that PolyU could shoulder all expenses of the new medical school before it opens in the new development area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will go hand in hand with the government to develop this third medical school... Regarding the detailed figure, we will let everybody know once it's ready," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Teng Jin-guang noted PolyU has been offering a number of healthcare programmes in almost half of a century that produced more than 50,000 graduates, which he described as a key strength of the university.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added artificial intelligence will feature prominently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The future medical service will rely heavily on AI-powered devices and systems," he said. "The design of the new medical school, particularly its pedagogy, will make full use of AI, so students will be able to pursue their studies more independently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university has pulled in a number of outside advisors to help with its bid, including leading Chinese infectious disease expert Zhong Nanshan, former health chief York Chow and Nobel laureate Barry Marshall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baptist University and the University of Science and Technology have also expressed their interest in running the city's third medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interviews with the three universities are planned for the second quarter, with the evaluation process expected to conclude within the year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people including the driver were injured when a bus hit an exit ramp road divider on Tolo Highway on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a report around noon that a KMB bus heading towards Sheung Shui hit the divider in Tai Po.
  <br>
  <br>
  An officer said the driver sustained injuries in the leg and was sent to North District Hospital in a semi-conscious state, while 10 passengers also sustained injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said the driver was scheduled for a rest day on Tuesday, adding that the company will assist the police with the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said it will review and follow up on the findings by the bus company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union Kowloon Bus Branch alleged that the driver was overworked because of poor scheduling by KMB, adding that many other bus drivers have had similar complaints.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union will meet with KMB's management on Thursday to discuss these problems and ask for better working conditions.

    Govt moves to boost healthcare data sharing

<img alt="The government hopes healthcare providers will proactively upload their patients' records onto the " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796401_2_20250319135402.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said it plans to amend the law to help boost the development of its one-stop “eHealth” platform.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government-developed platform, launched in 2016, enables the sharing of electronic health records among healthcare providers in both the public and private sectors, while also letting people access their own records.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Health Bureau said almost all data in the system currently comes from the public sector, and some private healthcare providers struggle to link their internal system with the eHealth system. Officials also said some private clinics believe patients' records are their personal assets, and are reluctant to share their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed changes to the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance, the secretary for health will be empowered to require all healthcare providers to enter important data into their patients' eHealth accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include prescription, diagnosis, allergies and adverse drug reactions, immunisation records, as well as laboratory and radiology reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Healthcare providers failing to meet such requirements could face a fixed fine of HK$1,500 and be prosecuted for a fine of up to HK$50,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau also proposed simplifying the consent mechanism, so when individuals open an eHealth account, they automatically grant healthcare providers the right to upload their health records to the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to access the records, healthcare providers must still obtain a separate approval from the individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also looking into allowing some recognised healthcare providers on the mainland to provide and receive data across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  But these non-Hong Kong healthcare providers would only have temporary access, and must obtain explicit consent from their patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also hopes to expand access to eHealth to more healthcare professionals, including speech therapists and dietitians as well as those working in facilities managed by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a closed-door media briefing, Deputy Secretary for Health Sam Hui explained that the government hopes to establish a proper legal framework through the amendment bill and that the changes won't take effect until the market is ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government is working closely with healthcare groups and third-party service providers, to help with the integration of electronic systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill will be gazetted on Friday and brought to the Legislative Council for a first reading next Wednesday.

<img alt="The trio are charged with conspiracy to defraud, and the ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796388_1_20250319122707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC said on Wednesday two frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and a supplier have been charged with conspiracy to defraud.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three are two EMSD works supervisors, Tsang Tak-keung, 57, and Yip Wai-ho, 51, and Cheung Chun-kit, 66, who is the sole operator of three suppliers, namely Leader Med Technology, Hi Quali Trading and Smartechnique Services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Yip were responsible for contacting suppliers to get quotations for machinery parts and compiling internal quotation vetting documents for maintenance services to Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Yau Ma Tei Jockey Club Polyclinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Independent Commission Against Corruption said investigations revealed that Tsang allegedly accepted over 80 gifts worth a total of over HK$500,000 from Cheung, while Yip allegedly took more than 20 gifts worth about HK$800,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifts included luxurious watches, handbags, jewelry, household appliances and digital products.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Tsang and Yip allegedly placed HK$13 million worth of purchase orders with the suppliers over a seven-year period from 2017 to 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cases took place between January 2020 and June 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang and Cheung are alleged to have conspired to get the EMSD to make payments to the three companies by falsely claiming they were the lowest bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ended with the EMSD awarding around 180 purchase orders worth more than HK$8 million to Cheung’s companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip and Cheung are also alleged to have conspired in this case with defrauding the EMSD between January 2017 and last June in a similar manner, allowing Cheung’s companies to secure around 140 purchase orders worth about HK$5.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The trio had allegedly inflated the quantity and the price of the machinery parts in some of the purchase orders, while some other purchase orders were fabricated,” the ICAC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio will appear in the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts this afternoon for mention.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICAC said more charges could be laid against the trio.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said on Wednesday its cable car services were suspended due to signal issues, and facilities at its upper park were closed temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the Ocean Express already suspended from Monday to Friday this week due to annual maintenance, there was no transport service between the lower and upper parks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Visitors can continue to enjoy park facilities at The Waterfront. We apologise for any inconvenience caused," Ocean Park wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure visitor safety, the park said the cable car system will be thoroughly inspected before resuming.

    'Joint property management key for older buildings'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs said the joint property management scheme will help homeowners to better manage and maintain their assets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year pilot scheme, which was unveiled in last year's Policy Address, will commence as soon as June in four districts: Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, a number of companies will handle the property management for clusters of aged buildings, with the minimum requirement of two, so that the so-called "three nil buildings," which do not have owners' corporation, property management services or resident organisations, can enjoy basic services at affordable prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Alice Mak pointed out that now's the right time to kick start the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the building management professional service scheme, which aims to allow "three-nil buildings" to set up owners' corporations with the help of NGOs, has been regularised and expanded to cover all districts in the SAR, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak pointed out that a property management firm will help homeowners tackle a lot of minor problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's an owners' corporation, and we look for a professional property management firm through the scheme to help with building management, and deal with minor issues to prevent delays and things getting worse, homeowners can save a lot of time and money," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, care teams will get 50 percent more funding in their next term of service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak noted that the government will review their service scope, as well as offer training to the members.
  <br>
  <br>
  But no matter how we train them, they cannot replace professional departments to offer services, she stressed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Talks on a ceasefire in Russia's conflict with Ukraine will continue on Sunday in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Fox News hours after Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Witkoff said talks on a ceasefire deal "will begin on Sunday in Jeddah."
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff said the US delegation in Saudi Arabia would be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, but did not indicate who they would be holding talks with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to a ceasefire on energy infrastructure and targets in the Black Sea, Witkoff said: "I think both of those are now agreed to by the Russians. I am certainly hopeful that the Ukrainians will agree to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting the US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider peace settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a 90-minute call with Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on Ukraine's allies halting all military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witkoff, however, reiterated the proposed ceasefire included "energy and infrastructure in general."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's envoy commended Russian President Putin "for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal." (AFP)

    Nanjing to finally host athletics championships

<img alt="Armand Mondo Duplantis makes a run for the pole vault event during the Mondo Classic in Uppsala, Sweden, this month. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796377_1_20250319105616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis headlines a stellar cast in Nanjing for a world indoor athletics championships delayed three times by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nanjing was picked to host the biennial event back in 2020, then in 2021 and then again in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were all moved due to coronavirus rules. In 2022 the event was instead held in Belgrade and in 2023 in Glasgow.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now has the green light and Nanjing's Cube will play host to 576 athletes from 127 countries competing in 26 events over three days of action from Friday to Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That number includes 11 individual defending champions, notably world record holders Duplantis (pole vault), Devynne Charlton and Grant Holloway (60m hurdles), and 20 medallists from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis, Holloway, Hamish Kerr (high jump), Thea Lafond (triple jump) and Miltiadis Tentoglou (long jump) followed up their Glasgow indoor successes with Olympic gold. They will be joined in Nanjing by fellow Olympic gold medallists Yaroslava Mahuchikh (high jump) and Jakob Ingebrigtsen (1500m and 3000m), also world record holders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super excited," Duplantis said. "It was my first time competing in China last outdoor season for the first two Diamond League meets and I jumped extremely well, broke the world record, to 6.24m.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-born Swede comes into the competition having bettered his world record, for the 11th time, to 6.27m at an indoor meet in the French city of Clermont on March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Duplantis insisted there would be no recalibration of his season goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not really," he said. "It's not the first time I've broken the world record in the indoor season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's according to plan right now, as far as I want."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis said he knew he was capable of "higher heights," insisting that he was "not fixated" by a certain height.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It takes a little bit of time and it's by fairly small increments and it does get a little bit more difficult every time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd like to get over 6.30m in the near future and then keep pushing it from there. Indoors is a great opportunity always to break the world record because we don't have to deal with the wind and whatnot so we have a lot more controlled variables in that sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's reigning Olympic, world and European outdoor champion Mahuchikh, will compete fresh from winning a third European title in Apeldoorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahuchikh won her latest accolade with a best of 1.99m before deciding not to go any higher, towards her record mark of 2.10m.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won the gold medal for my country. Of course, I am a little bit disappointed because I wanted to try and jump a bit higher," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope at the next championships I will be in better shape."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norway's Ingebrigtsen completed a distance double in the 1500 and 3,000m at the Apeldoorn Euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Competitions and championships are what it is all about," Ingebrigtsen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always been training towards something and setting goals, with the championship in mind. That is what sport is about. Racing, representing our nation and celebrating the sport."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US team does not feature Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles. Marcellus Moore, Emmanuel Wells and Ronnie Baker instead head the 60m entries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holloway will bid to become the first hurdler to win three consecutive world indoor titles. Teen prodigy Quincy Wilson is another absentee, the 17-year-old having turned down an invitation and insisting "school comes first!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who was edged into Olympic silver by Lyles in Paris, is ruled out with an injury. Nishion Ebanks and Rohan Watson will compete in the 60m. (AFP)

    Kyiv sees air raids hours after Trump-Putin call

 Ukraine on Wednesday accused Russia of effectively rejecting a US-backed ceasefire proposal, reporting a barrage of strikes on civilian infrastructure hours after Moscow agreed only to pause attacks on the energy grid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington has been pushing for a full, 30-day ceasefire as a first step towards a wider settlement of the grinding three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a 90-minute call with Donald Trump on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin refused, insisting that any such deal would be contingent on the West halting all military aid for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Kremlin, Putin has already ordered his military to pause strikes against Ukrainian energy targets for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The highly anticipated Putin-Trump call also resulted in the announcement that Russia and Ukraine will exchange 175 prisoners each on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky welcomed the proposed energy truce but said he needed more "details" from Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has launched devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war, while Ukraine has used drones to bomb multiple Russian oil installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions rang out and air raid sirens wailed in Ukraine just hours after Trump and Putin spoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said "there have been hits, specifically on civilian infrastructure", including a hospital in Sumy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is these types of nighttime attacks by Russia that destroy our energy sector, our infrastructure, and the normal life of Ukrainians," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full ceasefire."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Kyiv, Ukrainians were doubtful of any concessions from Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lev Sholoudko, 32 said he did not expect even the energy infrastructure would be spared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't believe Putin at all, not a single word. He only understands force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who says he has an "understanding" with Putin, has been seeking a breakthrough in the Ukraine war since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stunned the world when he announced he had started direct talks with Russia to end the conflict, sparking fears among allies that he was pivoting too far towards Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president hailed his latest call with Putin as "good and productive," and the White House said in a readout that the Russian leader had consented to a 30-day ceasefire on energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moscow also underlined that a fuller truce was dependent on long-standing demands for a "complete cessation" of Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kremlin statement also emphasised that Kyiv could not rearm or mobilise during any ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky, who accepted a full ceasefire proposal during talks in Saudi Arabia last week, has lashed out at Russia for its reluctance to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not ready to end this war, and we can see that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also said that Ukrainian troops would continue fighting in Russia's Kursk region "as long as we need," following days of major Russian advances in the area that Kyiv partially seized last year. (AFP)

    Trump to unveil reciprocal tariffs on April 2

<img alt="US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said if countries stop their practices, the US would not put up the tariff wall. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796362_1_20250319092836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee climate disasters last year, the United Nations said on Wednesday, highlighting the urgent need for early warning systems covering the entire planet.
 <br>
  <br>
  Poorer countries are severely affected by cyclones, droughts, wildfires and other disasters, according to the State of the Global Climate annual report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the UN's weather and climate agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WMO said the record number of people fleeing climate disasters was based on figures from the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which has been collecting data on the subject since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Mozambique, around 100,000 people were displaced by Cyclone Chido.
  <br>
  <br>
  But wealthy countries were also hit, with the WMO pointing to the floods in the Spanish city of Valencia, which killed 224 people, and the devastating fires in Canada and the United States which forced more than 300,000 people to flee their homes in search of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response, WMO and the global community are intensifying efforts to strengthen early warning systems and climate services," said the agency's chief Celeste Saulo.

  The WMO wants everyone in the world covered by such systems by the end of 2027.

  <br>
  Besides underlining the massive economic and social upheavals from extreme weather, the State of the Global Climate report said climate change indicators had once again reached record levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The clear signs of human-induced climate change reached new heights in 2024, with some of the consequences being irreversible over hundreds if not thousands of years," the WMO said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - and to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, and the first calendar year over the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, with the global mean near-surface temperature 1.55 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average, according to an analysis compiling the six major international datasets.

    Supreme Court chief chides Trump over impeachment call

<img alt="A brief statement from Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, said impeachment was not an appropriate response to disagreement. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796357_1_20250319090726.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday issued a rare public rebuke of President Donald Trump, over his call for the impeachment of a federal judge, in an extraordinary display of conflict between the executive and judiciary branches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rebuke from the Supreme Court's leader demonstrated how controversy over recent flights of Venezuelan immigrants has inflamed tensions over the judiciary's role, with a legal case challenging Trump's actions now threatening to spiral into a clash of constitutional powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said in a brief statement. "The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rare statement came just hours after a social media post from Trump, who described US District Judge James E Boasberg as an unelected “troublemaker and agitator.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg had issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been sharply critical of district courts which have blocked some of the president's executive actions but this was the first time Trump has personally called for a judge's impeachment since he took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010. (Agencies)

    Netanyahu warns strikes on Gaza 'just the beginning'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Tuesday that massive overnight strikes on Gaza were "only the beginning" and that future negotiations with Hamas "will take place only under fire".
 <br>
  <br>
  The strikes, by far the largest since a truce took effect in January, killed more than 400 people across Gaza, according to its health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said in a video statement on Tuesday evening that "Hamas has already felt the strength of our arm in the past 24 hours. And I want to promise you - and them - this is only the beginning".
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire whose first phase has expired, with Israel and Hamas disagreeing on whether to move to a new phase intended to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli premier said in his address that "from now on, negotiations will take place only under fire," before adding: "Military pressure is essential for the release of additional hostages".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the return of all the hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has not responded militarily so far, and in a statement urged friendly countries to "pressure" the United States to bring to an end the strikes by its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Israel consulted US President Donald Trump's administration before launching the strikes, while Israel said the return to fighting was "fully coordinated" with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  A State Department spokesperson said that "Hamas bears total responsibility... for the resumption of hostilities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations and countries around the world condemned the strikes, while the families of Israeli hostages pleaded with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the violence, fearing for the fate of their loved ones. (AFP)

    US releases final trove of Kennedy assassination files

<img alt="Documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are displayed after they were released. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796353_1_20250319084345.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US National Archives on Tuesday released the final batch of files related to the assassination of president John F Kennedy - a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump in January directing the unredacted release of the remaining files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother, former attorney general Robert F Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In accordance with President Donald Trump's directive... all records previously withheld for classification that are part of the President John F Kennedy Assassination Records Collection are released," the Archives said in a statement on its website on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Archives has released millions of pages of records over the past decades relating to the assassination of then-president Kennedy in November 1963, but thousands of documents had been held back at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy scholars have said the documents that were still held by the archives were unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald was shot by a strip club owner, Jack Ruby, on November 24, 1963 - two days after the Kennedy assassination - while being moved to a county jail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the records already released were raw intelligence, including scores of reports from FBI agents following up leads that led nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of what they contain was also previously known, such as that the communist-obsessed CIA cooked up several outlandish plots to murder Cuba's Fidel Castro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oswald defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 but returned to the United States in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the documents follows an October 26, 1992 act of Congress which required that the unredacted assassination records held in the National Archives be released in full 25 years later. (AFP)

    Ohtani leads Dodgers to MLB season-opener win in Tokyo

<img alt="Ohtani shook off the nerves to deliver two crucial hits during the Dodgers' season-opening win. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796342_1_20250319070737.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani admitted he was "nervous" playing in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as the Los Angeles Dodgers started the new Major League Baseball season with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese baseball superstar delivered two important hits as the World Series champion Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in front of over 40,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ohtani, a national hero in Japan, said he needed time to feel his way into his first MLB regular-season game in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since I've been this nervous playing a game," the 30-year-old said. "It took me a couple of at-bats to get into it but I was glad that I was able to do well in the later part of the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The series has been eagerly anticipated for months in Japan and excitement was at fever pitch at the start of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the occasion left its mark on the normally ice-cool Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous, but one thing I did notice was how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem," Roberts said. "That was telling."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers' Japanese starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto struck out four batters in five innings to come out on top in his duel with Chicago counterpart Shota Imanaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time two Japanese starting pitchers had ever gone head to head on MLB's opening day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demeanour he has on the mound, even if he gives up a run he's still calm," Ohtani said of Yamamoto. "He was able to grow into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The action got underway after a Pokemon-themed opening ceremony that featured an appearance by Japanese world champion boxer Naoya Inoue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani stepped up to the plate to start the game but the first pitch whistled past him for a strike before he grounded out to first base.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs had taken a one-run lead by the time Ohtani came back to bat and he again failed to get a hit, lining out to second baseman Jon Berti. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their downward slide on Tuesday as worries over the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts added to unease over President Trump's aggressive trade agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to yield a ceasefire, prompting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pledge continued fighting in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel resumed bombing Gaza in the deadliest attack since a ceasefire came into effect on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices spent the entire session in the red on the first day of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 41,581.31.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.1 percent to 5,614.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.7 percent to 17,504.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had risen the last two days in a partial rebound from declines in recent weeks as mixed economic data and uncertainty about the Trump administration's trade policies spark talk of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The news of what's going on politically, it's still very uncertain," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "I don't think there's any new news so far this week that should make the market feel more encouraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides uncertainty over the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Cahill also pointed to unease over an April 2 deadline when the Trump administration is expected to announce a fresh litany of tariffs.

    Nasa astronauts Wilmore and Williams splash down

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams returned to Earth in a SpaceX capsule on Tuesday with a soft splashdown off Florida's coast, nine months after their faulty Boeing Starliner craft upended what was to be a week-long stay on the International Space Station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their return caps a protracted space mission that was fraught with uncertainty and technical troubles and turned a rare instance of Nasa's contingency planning - and the latest failures of Boeing's Starliner - into a global spectacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams, two veteran Nasa astronauts and retired US Navy test pilots, had strapped inside their Crew Dragon spacecraft along with two other astronauts and undocked from the orbiting laboratory of the ISS at 1.05 a.m. ET (0505 GMT) to embark on a 17-hour trip to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-person crew, formally part of Nasa's Crew-9 astronaut rotation mission, re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 5:45 p.m. ET. Using Earth's atmosphere and two sets of parachutes, the craft slowed its orbital speed of roughly 17,000 miles per hour to a soft 17 miles per hour at splashdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed in re-entry suits, boots and helmets, the astronauts were seen earlier on Nasa's live footage laughing, hugging and posing for photos with their colleagues from the station shortly before they were shut into the capsule for two hours of final pressure, communications and seal tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astronaut pair had launched into space as Starliner's first crew in June for what was expected to be an eight-day test mission. But issues with Starliner's propulsion system led to cascading delays to their return home, culminating in a Nasa decision last year to have them take a SpaceX craft back this year as part of the agency's crew rotation schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission has captured the attention of US President Donald Trump, who upon taking office in January called for a quicker return of Wilmore and Williams and alleged without evidence that former President Joe Biden "abandoned" them on the ISS for political reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, echoed his call for an earlier return. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is the United States' only orbital-class crew spacecraft, which Boeing had hoped its Starliner would compete with before the mission with Wilmore and Williams threw its development future into uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the splashdown, the astronauts will be flown to their crew quarters at the space agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days of health checks, per routine for astronaut returns, before Nasa flight surgeons approve they can go home to their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Living in space for months can affect the human body in multiple ways, from muscle atrophy to possible vision impairment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have logged 286 days in space on the mission - longer than the average six-month ISS mission length, but far short of US record holder Frank Rubio. His continuous 371 days in space, ending in 2023, were the unexpected result of a coolant leak on a Russian spacecraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams, capping her third spaceflight, has tallied 608 cumulative days in space, the second most for any US astronaut after Peggy Whitson's 675 days. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko set the world record last year at 878 cumulative days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swept up in Nasa's routine astronaut rotation schedule, Wilmore and Williams could not begin their return to Earth until their replacement crew arrived, in order to maintain adequate US staffing levels, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their replacements arrived on Friday night - four astronauts as part of Nasa's Crew-10 mission that briefly put the station's headcount at 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short," Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month, adding that he did not believe Nasa's decision to keep them on the ISS until Crew-10's arrival had been affected by politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme's all about," he said. "Planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams had been doing scientific research and conducting routine maintenance with the station's other five astronauts. Williams had performed two six-hour spacewalks for maintenance outside the ISS, including one with Wilmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ISS, about 254 miles (409 km) in altitude, is a football field-sized research lab that has been housed continuously by international crews of astronauts for nearly 25 years, a key platform of science diplomacy managed primarily by the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams told reporters earlier this month that she was looking forward to returning home to see her two dogs and family. "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," she said. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Djokovic-backed players union takes aim at the sport's governing bodies, the ATP and WTA. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796331_1_20250319053811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tennis union co-founded by Novak Djokovic announced a series of legal actions aimed at the sport's governing bodies, alleging "anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) said it was suing both tour organisers, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) were also named as defendants in a series of actions in the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the ATP and WTA responded by vowing to defend themselves against the claims with the men's tour saying the PTPA has "consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA was set up by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil in 2020. Some 20 players were named as part of at least one of the actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades," said the PTPA statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tennis is broken," said Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement listed alleged abuses they are targeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the defendants "colluded", "fixing prize money and suppressing player earnings" forcing "an unsustainable schedule" and exploiting players financially.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies show a "disregard for players" by making them "compete in 100-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, endure matches that ended at 3 am, and play with different and injury-inducing tennis balls".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA also cited image right ownership, sponsorship restrictions and the "draconian system of ranking points".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also complained that tennis violates player "privacy rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Players are subjected to invasive searches of personal devices, random middle-of-the-night drug tests, and interrogations without legal representation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ATP said that it was continuing to make change, with player input and hit back at the union.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. The ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans," the tour concluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA also defended their approach to the game and said that PTPA's action "is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course."
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Djokovic and Pospisil, the seven-member PTPA executive council also includes players, Hubert Hurkacz, Ons Jabeur, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Taylor Townsend and Zheng Saisai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Nick Kyrgios, France's Varvara Gracheva and American Reilly Opelka have joined the PTPA's case in the United States, while Frenchman Corentin Moutet and Japan's Taro Daniel have joined the case in the United Kingdom. (AFP)

    Germany votes for big defence spending package

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German lawmakers gave the green light on Tuesday for a colossal spending boost for defence and infrastructure pushed by chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz amid deep fears in Europe over the future strength of the transatlantic alliance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented fiscal package – dubbed an "XXL-sized" cash "bazooka" by German media – could pave the way for more than one trillion euros in spending over the next decade in Europe's top economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The historic parliament vote signalled a radical departure for a country famously reluctant to take on large state debt – or to spend heavily on the armed forces, given its dark World War II history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor after his CDU/CSU alliance won last month's elections, argued that dramatic steps are needed at a time of geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's war with Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  European countries have been further unsettled by US President Donald Trump's outreach to Russia and signals of an uncertain commitment to Nato and Europe's defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to parliament, Merz cited Russia's "war of aggression against Europe" and said the funding boost would spell "the first major step towards a new European defence community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Merz's centre-right alliance and their likely future coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have hammered out the package over recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would exempt defence spending above one percent of GDP from Germany's strict debt rules and set up a 500-billion-euro (US$545-billion) fund for infrastructure investments over 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the short term, Berlin looked set to soon approve an additional three billion euros in military aid for Ukraine. (AFP)

    Putin, Trump fail to reach deal on full ceasefire

<img alt="The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796323_1_20250319031834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday on a halt in Russian attacks against Ukrainian energy targets – but fell far short of securing a full ceasefire in a highly anticipated phone call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two spoke for more than an hour and a half, and both expressed hopes for repairing relations between the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was no agreement from the Russian president for Washington's proposed full 30-day ceasefire in Russia's war with its pro-Western neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said Putin agreed to pause strikes on Ukraine energy targets for 30 days and that Putin had already given the order to his military. The White House said separately that the "leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has launched a series of devastating attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the three-year-old war. According to the Kremlin statement, Ukraine – which has bombed multiple Russian oil installations – had also agreed to the truce on energy targets, although Kyiv had yet to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders agreed that broader truce talks would "begin immediately in the Middle East," the White House said in its statement, also citing a "huge upside" if Russia and the United States improve their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin statement said a "key condition" for peace would be ending Western military and intelligence support to Ukraine's embattled military – a position that will alarm Kyiv and European capitals that have already accused Putin of stalling. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Despair mixed with anger in Kocani, North Macedonia on Tuesday in the wake of a horrific nightclub fire that left dozens dead and even more injured, prompting demands for justice.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the town of just 30,000 people, the deaths of 59 people – most of them teenagers and young adults – touched almost every home, with the agony of losing so many young people cutting especially deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are a small place. We all know each other," Sasko Jordanov, a 38-year-old dentist in Kocani, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am a doctor and have many patients dead, children of friends and neighbours."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have children – their friends died. This is horrible," said a woman as she lit candles at a makeshift shrine, where others left flowers and messages of condolence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire rapidly spread as a crowd of young fans packed into Club Pulse to attend the performance by a popular hip-hop band, DNK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze was apparently started by fireworks onstage igniting the ceiling of the nightclub.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 500 people were crammed inside despite just 250 tickets being sold, according to officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those killed were trampled as they rushed to the exits, while the roof was consumed with flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutor's office said the club had breached numerous fire regulations, including having insufficient extinguishers and emergency exits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Pance Toskovski said investigators had determined the club owner operated under a forged licence, and vowed to crackdown on corruption. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five primary school pupils who took part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill with gastroenteritis, adding to a string of similar cases in the past few weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday it was investigating the latest cluster involving pupils from SKH St Michael's Primary School in North Point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five were part of a group of 70 students and teachers who visited Xi'an between March 11 and 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health authorities said one of the five developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis such as vomiting on the last day of the tour. Four others sitting nearby the pupil who first fell ill began showing similar symptoms two days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sought medical attention but none required hospitalisation, officials said, adding their symptoms matched that of a norovirus infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The centre's preliminary investigation results show that the cases are likely to be infected through person-to-person transmission or an environment contaminated by vomit," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of secondary school pupils have come down with gastroenteritis after visiting the mainland on exchange tours, with the government forming a task force to look into the recent outbreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Bureau has reminded schools that have upcoming exchange tours to learn about the latest information on disease prevention and control, a spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the bureau's website on national education activities, it has urged schools to "avoid providing higher-risk food such as raw and cold food, siu mei and shellfish seafood when organising student exchange activities [on] the mainland".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also asked contactors of exchange programmes across the border who help to organise trips to stop supplying such dishes.

    'Funding cut won't affect non-local student tuition'

File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796300_1_20250318215610.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education authorities on Tuesday stressed that plans to slash funding for universities does not translate to a rise in tuition fees for non-local students as a source of income.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had announced plans to reduce public university funding by HK$2.8 billion over the next three academic years.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, education minister Christine Choi was asked if universities would raise fees for non-local students because of the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi said non-local students' tuition fee adjustments are not linked with the income of a university.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we increase the funding for universities, they will not lower the tuition for non-local students, so when non-local students come to Hong Kong to study – regardless of the change in our funding for universities – the tuition level is decided based on the cost of individual programmes," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of funding changes to publicly-financed universities, the institutions need to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government in a one-off special arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities would not be seriously affected with the move leaving them with around four months worth of reserves, Choi said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States on Tuesday said that Hamas had chosen war by refusing to release hostages, as Israel unleashed its most intense strikes since a ceasefire, killing more than 400 people, and vowed to continue fighting until all hostages are returned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that "Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hughes' statement comes as Hamas leader Sami Abu Zuhri said that the Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip were an attempt to force the group's "surrender", and called the United States "complicit" in the escalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aim of the massacres committed by the occupation in Gaza is to undermine the ceasefire agreement and attempt to impose a surrender agreement, writing it in the blood of Gaza," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar said that his country had "no alternative" other than to resume military operations in Gaza after efforts to secure the release of hostages failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saar's comments come as relatives of the Israeli hostages accused the country's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of sacrificing their loved ones by carrying out the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  They called on supporters of the hostages to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem, warning that "military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them back safe and sound".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liran Berman is a brother of twin siblings who are being held hostage in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now my brothers are alive. My worst nightmare is to become a family of deceased and killed hostages. This is my worst nightmare right now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the British government has called on Israel and Hamas to implement their ceasefire agreement for Gaza in full, and the EU has called for an immediate end to the renewed violence in the strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Moscow has said it deeply regrets Israel's resumption of military operation in Gaza. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One boss Stefano Domenicali held talks with Thailand's prime minister on Tuesday about possible plans to bring a grand prix to the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Italian ex-Ferrari boss who has just extended his contract to lead the sport until 2029, is keen to examine new markets as the sport soars in popularity, and Thailand has suggested it may be interested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of Formula One's 24-race schedule is locked in for several years, but gaps are set to open up and Domenicali suggested at the weekend that Thailand could be a contender to join the circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the talks, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand would move ahead with a feasibility study to examine the pros and cons of hosting F1 – including the costs and where the race would be run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not just about the honour of hosting the race, but also a significant opportunity to develop urban infrastructure, welcome tourists from around the world to Thailand and develop industry and service sectors," she posted on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's northeastern Buriram track has become a regular fixture on the MotoGP circuit, hosting the season-opening race earlier this month, but the kingdom has never hosted Formula 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Jirayu Houngsub said the prime minister told Domenicali that Thailand would work with F1 officials to see how a grand prix could work in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domenicali visited Bangkok in April last year for talks with then-prime minister Srettha Thavisin, who pitched his vision of bringing a race to the sprawling, traffic-clogged Thai capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said at the time they envisaged a street circuit, possibly around Bangkok's historic centre, as the kingdom looks to boost its image internationally through a host of "soft power" initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Thailand is not the only country knocking at F1's door – historic hosts France and Germany are seeking a return to the calendar, while the Turkish Grand Prix, last held in 2021, is also seen as a likely candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-Pacific region currently hosts four races – in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – while Thailand is represented on the grid by Alex Albon of Williams, who finished fifth in Melbourne. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday jailed the former boss of state-owned banking giant Everbright Group for bribery, state media said, the latest official to fall foul of President Xi Jinping's decade-long corruption crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced the investigation into Li Xiaopeng, the company's former Communist Party secretary and chairman, two years ago and brought him to trial in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV reported that a court in northeastern Heilongjiang found Li guilty of accepting bribes worth over 60 million yuan between 1994 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined six million yuan, CCTV said, adding that he received a lighter punishment for confessing his crimes and cooperating with authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The property and interest obtained through his bribes have been recovered... and turned over to the state treasury," CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, former Everbright chairman Tang Shuangning was jailed for 12 years for embezzlement and bribery. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate has increased slightly as authorities warned about the "uncertainties" caused by US trade protection measures going forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the city's unemployment rate increased  by 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent in the three-month period ending February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate, however, stood steady at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 1,600 people lost their jobs, taking the total to 111,700 in the December-February period, while the total number of those underemployed dropped by some 2,300 to stand at 40,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate rises were mostly seen in the food and beverages, transport, construction and professional and business service sectors, excluding cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun noted there were "diverse movements" in terms of the jobless rates in various sectors but that the rates "generally stayed low."
  <br>
  <br>
  He cautioned that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term amidst continued economic expansion, though some businesses would be affected by the uncertainties stemming from US trade protection measure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun's remarks came as the city's total employment number dropped by about 7,100 to more than 3.7 million, and total labour force decreased by about 5,400 to stand at 3.82 million last month.

    Hotter weather expected this year: Observatory

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Tuesday said residents can expect hotter weather this year due to the continuing impact of climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  It predicted that up to eight tropical cyclones will enter the city’s 500-kilometre warning radius from June or earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also said Hong Kong will be affected by rainstorms and localised heavy rain, despite predicting annual rainfall to be within the normal range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the temperatures in Hong Kong are on a rising trend in the past few years. In fact, in the last year, we have the highest wind temperature in Hong Kong. And it's a result of urbanisation and also the effect of climate change," said observatory director Chan Pak-wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at 2024, the observatory noted that it was the warmest year recorded globally, and that Hong Kong also recorded 11 months that were warmer than usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.3 and 22.8 degrees Celsius respectively, which were the highest and second highest on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also pointed out that sudden changes in the weather like on March 15, when it issued a hail warning and the first Amber rainstorm warning signal this year, are common in spring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said people should take note of push notifications from the observatory's mobile app to get immediate weather updates.

 Markets rose 2.2 percent on Tuesday, led by continued buying of mainland Chinese tech firms.

    ERB to offer new courses to highly educated trainees

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) on Tuesday said it will step up collaboration with tertiary institutions this year to provide advanced courses for people with a higher education level.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address last year plans to reform the ERB, and the board has since January expanded its service targets to include the entire local labour workforce, disregarding their education level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said since it expanded its coverage, about 4,000 people with a bachelor's or a higher-level degree have applied for ERB courses, making up about 12 percent of the total number of applications it received over the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Yu Pang-chun said the ERB has been actively promoting skills-based training to help people acquire new skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The ERB] strengthens its collaboration with tertiary institutions, broadens its network of training bodies to include institutions with extensive training experience, thereby supporting trainees with different educational attainments and background to pursue lifelong learning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board said it will work with the Hang Seng University, the University of Hong Kong's School of Professional and Continuing Education, and the Education University's Institute of Professional and Vocational Education and Lifelong Learning this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its executive director Byron Ng said the advanced courses may include the application of artificial intelligence models in various industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the expansion of our service targets, including the higher educated working population, more higher educated trainees can benefit from our courses, which include, of course, digital and technological courses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The board also revealed it expects to provide about 165,000 training places in 2025-26, and that it will submit its long-term plan to the government in the fourth quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Tuesday said 22 people have been arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes and helping intermediaries defraud banks of mortgage referral fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case involved over 200 mortgage applications and more than HK$2 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those arrested, aged between 31 and 58, include 18 frontline staff from 10 local banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, a married couple who worked at banks allegedly received HK$600,000 in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grace Yee, a principal investigator with the Independent Commission Against Corruption, explained how the fraud scheme worked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the investigation, the ICAC found that frontline bank staff had accepted bribes from intermediaries by secretly slipping referral forms into the mortgage loan documents that borrowers needed to sign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This made it appear as if customers who were directly applying for mortgage loans had come through intermediary referrals, allowing the intermediaries to fraudulently obtain referral fees from the banks."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yee said she believes the case only involves a few bad apples at individual banks and that Hong Kong's banking sector as a whole remains clean.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China women’s rugby team on Tuesday said they are ready to take their game to the next level at the upcoming Rugby Sevens, to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Natasha Olson-Thorne was brimming with excitement over playing in front of the home crowd in Kai Tak Stadium, telling RTHK her team is keen to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wants to build on their success last year when they were runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition, a tournament among Asian teams which runs alongside the showpiece Sevens event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just got to take it in," Olson-Thorne said during an open training session. "Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressure is something that we should enjoy, because we don't often get the chance to perform in front of our home crowd, friends, and family," she added. "So taking that and knowing they're behind us, that's a really important feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  Olson-Thorne, who made her international Sevens debut during the 2011 Hong Kong Women's Sevens, also said intense training sessions ahead of this year's competition has strengthened the bond between her teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been working on our physicality in the contact area, and also learning to trust ourselves and the team more," she explained. "It's brought us closer together and we're excited to showcase what we've learnt come the Hong Kong Sevens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chloe Chan, who late last year was selected as the new co-captain of the women's side, said she hopes to encourage her teammates to play to their strengths on the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The thing about our team is that we're all so different," said Chan. "We've got speed, we've got physical players, and bigger players who can help us build that foundation in our structure. That's the one thing we know we're good at – using each other's strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added she will do what she can to lead her teammates on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not a very vocal leader, so I don't really like to talk that much. But I like to think I can lead by example, so I'm hoping I can do my job the right way and build each other to do the same thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Andy Vilk, meanwhile, said he is looking forward to feeding off last year's energy, and said this year's Sevens will be a "unique experience" for his young squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year was a fantastic experience. It's an important experience for the players and their growth and to be able to play with that kind of pressure. We need to understand how we're going to embrace that pressure and use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vilk – who took up coaching duties just weeks before the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou – said his side will be ready to take on powerhouses Thailand and Kazakhstan in the Melrose Claymores, when the highly-anticipated three-day sporting event kicks off on March 28.

 The foreign ministers of South Korea, China and Japan will hold a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday, Seoul's foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and his Japanese and Chinese counterparts, Takeshi Iwaya and Wang Yi, will discuss cooperation since the last trilateral leaders' summit in May and exchange opinions on various topics, including the regional and international situation.

    Vaping devices ban sought to stop space oil drug use

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health on Tuesday called on the government to ban the possession of e-cigarettes devices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Henry Tong said the situation with teenagers taking the space oil drug is worrying.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said teachers and parents find it hard to spot students taking the drug, which is usually inhaled through vaping devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong noted that e-cigarettes make it easy to easy to hide abuse of the drug as, unlike with the distinctive smell of traditional cigarettes, the space oil drug offers different flavours such as fruit and chocolate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the government should proceed with all haste in implementing the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said 300 people reportedly took the drug last year, with 75 percent of them aged below 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a greater incidence of the cases in North district, Yuen Long and Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng Sing-chin, chairman of Tuen Mun District Secondary School Heads Association, said on the same show that the number of reported space oil cases in these places might be due to their higher number of students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the participation rate for the "Healthy School Programme," an anti-drug education initiative that comes with voluntary drug testing, varies among districts.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, while more than 90 percent of the schools in Tai Po have already signed up for the scheme, only a few schools among the dozens in other districts have done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK there might be a reason why some schools decided not to join the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that maybe for schools, anti-drug education might not be a high priority. Because actually there were only a very low number of students taking drugs. It's a minority. Therefore, teachers' time and efforts might be on education," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, we care a lot about students' mental health and emotions, and they might focus more on these areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng emphasised that rather than mainly relying on tests to tell if a student is on drug, the priority should be on teachers' observation and peer support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday that the Legislative Council general election will be held on December 7.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said three months prior to the poll, a by-election would be held for the Election Committee tasked with nominating and electing 40 Legco members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted that of the 967 elected members in the 1,500-strong committee, there are 90 vacancies and there's a need to fill them in a by-election set for September 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said electoral officials will provide more details later, such as the nomination periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have directed the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau to prepare for the elections, and collaborate closely with the Electoral Affairs Commission," Lee said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Electoral Affairs Commission will work on vote counting, data systems and security, among other tasks, to ensure everything goes smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco election will return 90 lawmakers for the eighth legislature since the SAR's establishment, and it's the second poll since the national legislature passed a decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system four years ago.

    'Changes in checkpoints for drivers need coordination'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said any changes to cross-border driving arrangements must prioritise traffic management and require careful coordination with mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, cross-boundary private cars are only allowed to use designated border checkpoints for entry and exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference vice-chairman and former chief executive CY Leung called the arrangement unreasonable, saying such vehicles should be able to use different ports to travel in and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee told reporters the government must ensure smooth traffic flow at all checkpoints when it considers any changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One consideration that we have to take into account is that if there aren't any regulations or controls, some of the ports that provide more convenience may see serious traffic congestion and the congestion may affect the urban areas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said any changes would require cooperation between local and mainland authorities since cross-border control points involve traffic management on both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2023, some private cars and cross-boundary coaches have been permitted to use different control points, Lee noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said members of his administration would continue to work with their mainland counterparts and study potential new arrangements that align with people's expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least seven people were killed on Monday when a small plane crashed into the sea while taking off from the Honduras Caribbean island of Roatan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major Wilmer Guerrero of the country's fire department told reporters 10 people were retrieved from the site of the crash, six of whom were pronounced dead at the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A crew member's body was then found floating in the sea near the plane, which crashed about a kilometre from the coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials gave conflicting reports on the number of people on board the plane -- either 17 or 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guerrero said one of the passengers, a 40-year-old French citizen, would be transferred to a hospital in the city of San Pedro Sula on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lanhsa airlines plane took off at nightfall from Roatan, one of the Bay Islands, and one of Honduras' main tourist destinations, heading for the port of La Ceiba, on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing," a fisherman told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had "immediately activated" an emergency committee made up of the armed forces, firefighters, and others to assist the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash was caused by an "apparent mechanical failure" on the British-made Jetstream 41, police said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said concerns expressed over CK Hutchison’s deal to sell its global port operations to a US consortium are worthy of "serious attention," saying foreign governments should provide a fair environment for deal-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment on Tuesday when asked about Beijing officials re-posting of articles criticising the deal, which also included the selling of the firm's operations at the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale came after US President Donald Trump reportedly asked the military to draw up plans to ensure American access of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said foreign governments should ensure that global trades are made in a fair manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that the SAR government will ensure that any transactions are made in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CK Hutchison and CK Assets announced that they will not hold press and investors briefings on Thursday, when they release annual results.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A special admission scheme that makes it easier for guests from 10 Asean nations to visit Hong Kong will start on Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee has announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Such guests include those who have made significant economic contributions to the SAR or been invited to important events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can enjoy fast immigration clearance through self-service gates and have a special counter to handle their visas and paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can stay for two or more months and enjoy these benefits for three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the move is aimed at strengthening the city's ties with Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now this special scheme will facilitate the attendance of talent from Asean member states in our important meetings and facilitate their investments in Hong Kong, thus encouraging them to use Hong Kong as a springboard to go global," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean is one of Hong Kong's closest economic partners and the city's second-largest trading partner in merchandise trade, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive said the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Department of Justice will start sending out invitations to business and legal leaders.
