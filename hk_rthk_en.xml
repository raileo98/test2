<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court extended the detention of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday over concerns he could destroy evidence linked to his martial law declaration, enraging his supporters who attacked the court building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of pro-Yoon protesters smashed windows and broke down doors to enter the court after the decision was announced, chanting the name of the president, who plunged South Korea into its worst political chaos in decades with his bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law declaration lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday on insurrection charges after he refused investigators' summons and went to ground in his residence, using his presidential security detail to resist arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon had also refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The disgraced leader, who attended court for the first time on Saturday over his case, will now remain in custody, with the new warrant allowing investigators to keep him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon slammed the court decision, but also warned the president's supporters not to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely not what President Yoon desires," he said in a statement, adding violence could also "create burdens" for the president's future trials. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire in the Gaza war begins on Sunday morning, mediator Qatar said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to bring back "all the hostages" held in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce is intended to end more than 15 months of fighting and devastating bombardment, but in a televised address on Saturday evening, the hawkish premier stressed Israel had US support to return to war if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an initial 42-day ceasefire, Palestinian militant groups will hand over 33 hostages, three of them on Sunday, and Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom will be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since mediators Qatar and the United States, which brokered the deal along with Egypt, announced the details on Wednesday, Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Gaza's civil defence rescue agency said at least five members of one family were killed when a strike hit their tent in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions were heard over Jerusalem as Yemen's Huthi rebels launched a barrage of missiles at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians ahead of the truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Huthis said they targeted the defence ministry in Tel Aviv and also fired two missiles at the Red Sea port city of Eilat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told Sky News the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed in December 2023, adding it amounted to 13 months of "waste".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration for a second term as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end". "We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh on Saturday detained a second person suspected of involvement in a knife attack in which Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was wounded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home in Mumbai early on Thursday. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, and is out of danger, doctors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got information from Mumbai Police that a suspect is travelling by Jnaneswari Express train," Sanjeev Sinha, a representative of the Railway Protection Force, told the ANI news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "...Mumbai Police officials were contacted through video call and the suspect's identity was confirmed. He has been detained," Sinha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in India's financial capital of Mumbai had on Friday detained another key suspect in the knife attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Khan, one of Bollywood's most bankable and well-known actors, shocked the film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred," the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the "assailant killed himself."
  <br>
  <br>
  State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases "fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having "overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded," according to the US Department of the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants "who planted a magnetic bomb on his vehicle," according to Mizan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperamental Russian Daniil Medvedev was on Saturday fined US$76,000 over his behaviour at the Australian Open, where he destroyed a net camera, threw his racquet and skipped a post-match press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number five was penalised US$10,000 for a meltdown during his five-set first-round win against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej, when he mangled his racquet and ruined the camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced an even bigger penalty – $66,000 – over his antics in the next round when he crashed out to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the match he threw his racquet toward the sidelines, skidding across the court until it reached an advertising panel near his bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also argued with the umpire after being called out for repeated foot faults, then skipped his obligatory post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev had reached three of the last four Australian Open finals, including in 2024 when he imploded after leading by two sets, losing to Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

    Indian court finds man guilty in hospital rape case

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian court on Saturday found a 33-year-old man guilty of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the victim's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata last August once again highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the world's most populous country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It led to demands by doctors at government hospitals for additional security, with thousands of citizens in Kolkata and elsewhere in India joining the doctors' protests in solidarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of defendant Sanjoy Roy was fast-tracked through India's normally glacial legal system and arguments in the case concluded a little over a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence will be delivered on Monday," presiding judge Anirban Das said after finding Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, guilty of rape and murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy has consistently maintained his innocence and again told the court that he was not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have been framed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was brought to court by a prison van and greeted by a crowd of protesters, held at bay by police officers, demanding he be given the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hang him, hang him," they chanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentiment was echoed by the victim's family, none of whom have been identified in keeping with Indian law around the reporting of sexual violence cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if he is not handed down the death penalty," said the victim's mother, seated just a few metres from Roy when the verdict was read out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her father added: "He brutally snuffed out the life of our daughter. He deserves the same fate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trainee doctor was found raped and murdered in a seminar room of the hospital last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crime led to nationwide outrage and prolonged protests by doctors across the state, demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy was arrested a day after the victim's body was discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court set up a national task force after the protests that suggested ways to enhance safety measures in government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time on Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's December 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained on Wednesday in a dawn raid.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant on Friday to extend his detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  He decided to appear in court "with the intention of restoring his honour," the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said before the hearing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision on Saturday night or early on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the court, crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding "release the president" placards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would give prosecutors time to formalise an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyrie Irving scored 25 points as the Dallas Mavericks brought the high-flying Oklahoma City Thunder down to earth with a 106-98 victory over the Western Conference leaders on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City, riding high after their rout of Eastern Conference pace-setters Cleveland on Thursday, suffered just their seventh defeat of the season in a roller-coaster duel against a fired-up Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving was at the heart of the Mavs win, rattling in 17 points in a 41-point second quarter that allowed Dallas to open up a 64-43 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, who were missing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with a wrist injury, came roaring back to draw level in the third quarter before edging into a single-digit lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Mavs, who are still without the injured Luka Doncic, regrouped superbly to close out the win, outscoring the Thunder 29-22 in the fourth quarter to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas improved to 23-19 while Oklahoma City remain top of the West with a 34-7 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas coach Jason Kidd saluted his team's resilience in securing victory after watching a 20-point lead evaporate in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat in that third quarter," Kidd said. "We said on the bench we needed to stay the course, and stay together and in the fourth quarter we did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel like we have a talented team, and they have a talented team. So I thought tonight was a really good test for our group."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Friday, Jimmy Butler returned for Miami after serving a seven-game in-house suspension but was powerless to prevent the Heat from slumping to a 133-113 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic bagged his 17th triple-double of the season, finishing with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a comfortable victory for the 2023 NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Denver scoring with 30 points on a night when seven Nuggets players finished in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, who was suspended by Miami after indicating he wished to leave the club earlier this month, finished with 18 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Boston, Jayson Tatum scored 30 points as the NBA champion Celtics shrugged off their heaviest loss of the season to outclass the Orlando Magic 121-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, dominated 110-97 by lowly Toronto on the road on Wednesday, showed no signs of a hangover to complete a comfortable home victory at the TD Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando took a short-lived lead early in the first quarter but once Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown found their range, the result was never in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 30-point haul came from 12-of-21 shooting with four three-pointers, six rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porzingis finished with 23 points and Brown added 20, including a perfect 9-of-9 from the free-throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston improved to 29-12 with the victory to remain in second place in the Eastern Conference behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando's scoring was led by Cole Anthony with 23 points while Paolo Banchero continued his return from injury with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York meanwhile, Anthony Edwards erupted for 36 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves romped to a 116-99 victory over the Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edwards was on fire from outside the arc, making 8-of-13 three-pointers while Naz Reid also caught the eye with 6-of-6 threes in a 23-point cameo shift off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, the Bucks handed Toronto a reality check following their upset of Boston on Wednesday, with a 130-112 blowout at the Fiserv Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee swept to their third-straight win thanks to 35 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo and 26 points from Damian Lillard. The Bucks improved to 23-17 with the victory and remain in the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In San Antonio, Santi Aldama scored 29 off the bench as the Memphis Grizzlies overwhelmed Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs 140-112.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs star Wembanyama produced another big defensive performance with six blocks and a steal with 12 rebounds. But the Grizzlies' balanced offence proved too strong for the home side, with six players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

 Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang on Saturday said the administration had received nearly 120,000 applications through the Top Talent Pass Scheme by the end of last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon event, the minister noted that more than 90,000 applications have been approved and about 76,000 people have arrived in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine universities on the mainland and four overseas were added to the list of institutions covered by the talent scheme in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual update at the beginning of this year, 199 universities are now on the list.

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788120_1_20250118152734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law has died at the age of 84, his family announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace," said the star's family in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law scored a total of 237 goals in 404 appearances during an 11-year spell at Old Trafford until 1973, which places him third behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton on United's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  He played 55 times for Scotland after making his debut at just 18 in 1958 and he remains his country's joint all-time leading scorer with 30 goals alongside Kenny Dalglish.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his time at United, Law won the first division title in 1965 and 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a cartilage injury forced him to miss the famous 4-1 thrashing of Benfica in the European Cup final at Wembley – a triumph that made United the first English winners of the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester United said the club was mourning the loss of "the king of the Stretford End" – the stand at Old Trafford where there is a statue of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players," United added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ultimate goalscorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently," his family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you." (AFP)

    Israeli government approves Gaza ceasefire deal

<img alt="For these starving Palestinians the truce cannot come fast enough. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788118_1_20250118141650.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's cabinet voted to approve a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Saturday, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ending days of uncertainty about whether the truce would go into effect this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take effect at 0630 GMT on Sunday morning, Qatar, which helped mediate the deal, said on Saturday, and would halt the fighting and bombardment in Gaza's deadliest-ever war.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would also enable the release of hostages held in the territory since Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has approved the hostage return plan," Netanyahu's office said early on Saturday morning after the cabinet held its vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's justice ministry has said 737 prisoners and detainees will be freed as part of the first phase of the deal – none before 4:00 pm local time (1400 GMT) on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli strikes have killed dozens since the ceasefire deal was announced, with the military saying on Thursday it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza over the previous 24 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce is to take effect on the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, who claimed credit for working with outgoing US President Joe Biden's team to seal the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was earlier approved by Israel's security cabinet, with Netanyahu's office saying it "supports achieving the objectives of the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority has completed preparations "to assume full responsibility in Gaza" after the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the truce begins, displaced Gazans were preparing to return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will go to kiss my land," said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. "If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, there was joy but also anguish over the remaining hostages taken in the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday falls on Saturday, is the youngest hostage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas said in November 2023 that Kfir, his four-year-old brother Ariel and their mother Shiri had died in an air strike, but with the Israeli military yet to confirm their deaths, many are clinging to hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think of them, these two little redheads, and I get shivers," said 70-year-old Osnat Nyska, whose grandchildren attended nursery with the Bibas brothers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two far-right ministers had voiced opposition to the deal, with one threatening to quit the cabinet, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before the vote he believed the ceasefire would proceed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory, killing more than 100 people and wounding hundreds more since the deal was announced on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, warned that Israeli strikes were risking the lives of hostages and could turn their "freedom... into a tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7, 2023 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,876 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of fruitless negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days of talks, Biden pointman Brett McGurk was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to get the deal over the line, US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we weren't involved... the deal would've never happened," Trump said in an interview on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, announcing the agreement on Wednesday, said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, he said: "We seek a full implementation of the first phase, and for the second phase to be the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are waiting for the Security Council to issue a binding resolution to implement the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli authorities assume the 33 are alive, but Hamas has yet to confirm that.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences," the Qatari prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two sources close to Hamas said three Israeli women soldiers would be the first to be released on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women may, in fact, be civilians, as the militant group refers to all Israelis of military age who have undergone mandatory military service as soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where hostages would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being "transported via helicopter or vehicle" to hospitals in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel "is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences," a source said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During talks on Friday, negotiators agreed to form a joint operations room in Cairo to "ensure effective coordination" and compliance with the truce terms, Egyptian state-linked media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  French President Emmanuel Macron said French-Israeli citizens Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi were among the hostages due to be freed in the first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden said the second phase could bring a "permanent end to the war."
  <br>
  <br>
  In aid-starved Gaza, where nearly all of its 2.4 million people have been displaced at least once, humanitarian workers worry about the monumental task ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything has been destroyed, children are on the streets, you can't pinpoint just one priority," said Doctors Without Borders coordinator Amande Bazerolle. (AFP)

    'Businesses need to adapt and innovate'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said it's important for the city's retail, catering and hotel sectors to be adaptable and innovative - to attract a broader consumer base.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, he said the total number of visitors to Hong Kong last year surpassed 44 million, marking a 30 percent annual increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that despite the SAR experiencing a 7.3 percent year-on-year decline in retail sales value last November, there was a positive shift during the Christmas and New Year period, with some businesses reporting double-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from an increase in visitors from mainland China, there were also many more visitors from Southeast Asia under the new 'multiple-entry visa' scheme. I believe that, especially this year, this should greatly benefit the retail sector, particularly during holidays," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But given the overall global economic environment and changing consumer patterns, we need to adapt. The retail and catering sectors need to think about how to transform. Hong Kong has many eateries with long queues, indicating their popularity. We can look at why these eateries are so successful."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said online shopping is going to become the dominant trend in the global retail landscape, making it necessary for businesses to revamp their business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo this year will be promoted on e-commerce platforms across mainland China and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the SAR offers a plethora of sought-after brands and products, including food, cosmetics, and health items that hold significant popularity in mainland markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if recent cases of Hong Kong residents being forced to work on illegal scams in several Southeast Asian countries would impact Hong Kong businesses' willingness to invest and operate in those areas, Yau said the two issues should not be intertwined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been doing business in Southeast Asia for a long time. There are many Hong Kong businesses in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. When I went to Cambodia, there were also many Hong Kong people who are living happily there and setting up business there. Similarly, there are Hong Kong businesses in Laos," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these are two separate matters that should not be confused. The occurrence of such events should not affect people's willingness to do business."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up a visit to the harbourfront boardwalk in North Point to talk to Hongkongers – and managed to fit in an impromptu jog.
 <br>
  <br>
  The walkway – built under the Island Eastern Corridor – spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  The section from Fortress Hill to North Point will open to the public on January 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boardwalk will have viewing platforms and shared spaces for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, and pet owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Movable bridges have also been installed to allow vessels access to the inner waters.

  The Development Bureau and the Eastern District Office invited some people on Saturday to try out the boardwalk – while Lee was there for an inspection.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an inspection of about half an hour, Lee invited some Hongkongers to join him for a jog along the boardwalk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My personal feeling is that whether you run, jog, or cycle along the boardwalk, the scenery is amazing. It’s nice to take in the views in a busy schedule, and Hong Kong is a beautiful place to call home,” he said after the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau earlier announced that the section between North Point and Quarry Bay will be opened in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the completion of the project, a 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade will connect Kennedy Town in the west with Shau Kei Wan in the east of Hong Kong Island.

    Children should get flu jabs 'before LNY travel'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician has urged parents planning Lunar New Year travels with their kids to ensure their children get their flu jabs immediately, citing an increased risk of influenza-related complications following the pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme on Saturday, Dr Patrick Ip, from the University of Hong Kong's department of paediatrics, said severe influenza infections could result in complications such as pneumonia, pneumococcal infection or respiratory syncytial virus infection, posing a heightened risk, especially for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the vaccination rate among children is still low, with more than 50 percent yet to receive their jabs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are already entering into the winter and already entering into the peak season of influenza outbreak. We want to encourage all the parents to try to bring your children to receive influenza vaccination as quickly as possible. Now for those younger children younger than nine years old, they need to receive at least two doses of influenza vaccine separated by four weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each dose of influenza, usually after the vaccination, it takes two weeks to become much more effective in protection."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said parents have different vaccination options available for their children, which can be accessed at different locations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vaccination programme this year actually has been well being conducted in the different areas including by hospital clinic settings, but also with a very good outreach programme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the government ... allowed a very flexible on-site vaccination scheme to the schools. They can choose either to receive the conventional injection of inactivated vaccine or they could also choose the nasal influenza live-attenuated vaccine option."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that the upward trend in influenza cases is expected to continue, predicting more severe instances in the next few weeks.

    Law change on public housing misuse on its way

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government is confident of passing a law change this legislative session making serious misuse of public housing a crime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Housing Ordinance, people who break the rules - such as subletting units or using them for business without living there - can face fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the toughest punishment for rule-breakers is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ho gave some examples of what might qualify as serious misuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, one unit had lots of mirrors installed and was used as a dance studio. And we found a unit which had fitness equipment in which the tenant was training gym-goers. In these situations, people aren't living there, and they're using public housing to make money, so we class this as serious misuse of public housing,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the administration would look at each instance on a case-by-case basis, and would be reasonable and compassionate in enforcing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, residents who hold small-scale tutorial classes for money, or make handcrafts for online businesses might not be seen as seriously misusing their units, the housing minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration had held talks with major parties and received their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Legco's panel on housing is scheduled to discuss the legislation change next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the cash reward scheme for people who want to report illegal public housing use kicked off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said about 200 reports had been submitted in the last two days, although one-fourth of informants didn’t want the reward, and there were some false claims.
  <br>
  <br>
  She estimated there would be about 1,300 successful reports this year, with authorities giving out more than HK$4 million in cash.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump said his inauguration will be held inside the US Capitol rather than outdoors because of severe cold.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The weather forecast for Washington, DC, with the wind chill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way," Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump referred to the last time an inauguration was moved indoors because of the cold - former Republican President Ronald Reagan's second swearing-in in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said supporters can view the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a sports venue in downtown Washington that holds 20,000 people. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stock indexes closed their best week in two months with a flourish on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 59.32 points, or one percent, to 5,996.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 334.70, or 0.8 percent, to 43,487.83, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 291.91 points, or 1.5 percent, to 19,630.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were driven by big tech stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the companies in the so-called Magnificent Seven rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks were helped this week by an encouraging report on US inflation , which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more interest rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the latest inflation data, some experts are still bearish about the prospects for more cuts. With the US economy in solid overall shape, "you shouldn't fix what's not broken," Bank of America economists Claudio Irigoyen and Antonio Gabriel said in a BofA Global Research report.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also pointed to the uncertainties created by "Trumponomics 2.0," amid fears that the new administration's policies could help push up inflation. (AP)

    US Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court refused to rescue TikTok on Friday from a law that requires the popular short-video app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or banned on Sunday in the United States on national security grounds — a major blow to a platform used by nearly half of all Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  The justices unanimously ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgement of free speech. TikTok, ByteDance, and some of the app's users challenged the measure, prompting the justices to uphold a lower court's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary," the court said in the unsigned opinion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court added, "We conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate the petitioners' First Amendment rights."
  <br>
  <br>
  The case pitted free speech rights against national security concerns in the age of social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday reiterated Biden's position that "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law "must fall to the next administration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok plans to shut down US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<img alt="Erling Haaland has scored 111 goals in 126 games for Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788067_1_20250117224045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland has signed a new 9.5-year deal at Manchester City that will keep him at the Etihad until 2034, the Premier League champions announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old striker's existing contract was due to expire in June 2027 but he has now committed his future to the club for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal is the longest in the Premier League, eclipsing the nine-year contract Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year and Haaland's salary will reportedly be about £500,000 (US$610,000) per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post on the club's X account read: "Erling's here to stay! We're thrilled to announce Erling Haaland has extended his contract at City to 2034."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made an instant impact after joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, firing 52 goals in all competitions to help the club win a Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in his first season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored a further 38 goals last season as City won a fourth consecutive league title and his overall tally stands at 111 goals in 126 games for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club," said Haaland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years. They have made this such a special place to be and now I am City no matter what."
  <br>
  <br>
  City's outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain said: "Everyone at the club is absolutely delighted that Erling has signed his new contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact he is signed for so long demonstrates our commitment to him as a player, and his love of this club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has made an incredible impact already in his time here and his amazing numbers and records speak for themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's extension is a major boost for City in a season where they have unexpectedly struggled on the pitch, with the club sitting sixth, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also appears to be a huge show of faith from the player at a time when the club is waiting to learn the outcome of a major disciplinary case.
  <br>
  <br>
  City faced an independent commission hearing last year to examine more than 100 charges from the Premier League concerning alleged breaches of its financial rules, charges the club have always strenuously denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new contract renewal comes two months after Guardiola's decision to sign a new two-year deal of his own. (AFP)

    IMF raises global growth outlook

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global growth is expected to increase slightly this year while remaining stuck below its pre-pandemic average, the IMF said on Friday, flagging the growing economic divide between the United States and European countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an update to its flagship World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global growth to hit 3.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its previous forecast in October, and to remain at 3.3 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growth is steady," IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding it remained below the average global growth rate in the first two decades of the 21st century of 3.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects the global inflation rate to continue decelerating, reaching 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2026, with prices cooling faster in advanced economies than in emerging markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among advanced economies, the interesting development here is the strength and resilience and growth of the US economy," Gourinchas said, pointing to the IMF's decision to hike its outlook for US growth to 2.7 percent in 2025 and to 2.1 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market has been strong, there is strong demand, private demand is robust, there is good confidence," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects China's growth rate to continue cooling this year to 4.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from the October forecast, before easing to 4.5 percent next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slight upgrade was due to the Chinese government's recently announced package of fiscal support to help prop up the economy, amid an ongoing property market slump and uncertainty about trade policy once Donald Trump takes office next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy is leading to something of a "rebalancing" among emerging markets, Gourinchas said, with countries including India -- which the IMF expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year and next -- playing a more important role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to pick up by less than previously forecast due largely to the effect of oil production cuts by the Opec+ group of oil-producing nations, which includes Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the risks to the IMF's forecasts is policy uncertainty in the United States, where Trump is preparing to return to the White House and has threatened to unleash tariffs on a host of nations including China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the economic picture in America stands in stark contrast to the Euro area, where a sharp downgrade for Germany has dampened expectations for a rebound in growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF now sees Euro area growth to increase slightly to 1.0 percent this year, and 1.4 percent in 2026, below its October forecasts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, on Friday said the SAR has to strengthen its advantage of international connectivity, and not weaken it.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment during the office's annual spring reception at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong needs to "shoulder its sacred responsibilities to the motherland" by safeguarding the constitutional order and the One Country, Two Systems principle, while being able to adapt to changes and be innovative.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the world is going through great changes not seen in a century, Hong Kong could seize the opportunities that came its way as it has the country's strong backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can surely attract money and resources from all sides. The key is to achieve our better selves through staying upright, and continue to write the legendary story of Hong Kong in the new era," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said by staying upright, he meant maintaining a business environment that is free and based on the rule of law, as well as an inclusive and multicultural environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to persist in connecting both with the mainland and with the world, while resolutely integrating into the country's overall development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's advantage to connect internally, is that it is an external-oriented [city.] Its international advantages can only be strengthened, not weakened."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng went on to stress that safeguarding security and focusing on development go hand in hand, and local officials have to always stay vigilant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Chief Executive John Lee said he would lead the government in uniting different sectors of society, while working hard on reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong would focus on increasing the liquidity of offshore reminbi, in a bid to attract more mainland and international firms to list on the local stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials would also look into improving the mechanism of connecting local financial markets with those on the mainland, as well as signing more investment and trade pacts with different countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Israeli security cabinet approved a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal on Friday, recommending the wider government give its final green light, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing all the political, security and humanitarian aspects, and understanding that the proposed deal supports achieving the objectives of the war, (the security cabinet) has recommended that the government approve the proposed framework," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire is expected start on Sunday with the first hostages released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The security cabinet meeting came after Netanyahu’s office said there were last minute snags in finalising the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had delayed a security cabinet vote on Thursday, blaming the dispute with Hamas for holding up approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a pre-dawn statement cleared the way for the deal to be voted on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the deal expected to begin on Sunday, 33 hostages are set to be released over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remainder, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second phase that will be negotiated during the first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. (Agencies)

<img alt="Police stand guard at the Seoul Detention Centre where South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is being held. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788041_1_20250117185548.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk-yeol for alleged insurrection asked a Seoul court on Friday to extend his detention as the embattled leader again refused to be questioned.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Yoon became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, in a criminal probe related to his short-lived declaration of martial law in early December. He is being held at the Seoul Detention Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In order to hold Yoon in custody for longer, investigators at the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) need a court to approve a detention warrant for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CIO official told a briefing on Friday that investigators had made the request due to "the gravity of the crime". Yoon's current arrest term was due to expire by Friday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court struck down a challenge on Thursday from Yoon's lawyers over the legality of his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement disseminated by his lawyer, Yoon said the jail cell where he is being held was "a little uncomfortable" but that he was doing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked his supporters, hundreds of whom gathered outside the prison in chilly conditions, saying: "I am grateful for the people's burning patriotism."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has stonewalled efforts by the CIO to interrogate him while his party has capitalised on political polarisation to improve its approval ratings since his arrest, polling showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has fully stated his basic position on the first day (of the arrest), and we believe there is no reason or need to answer the Q&A style back-and-forth," Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's legal team has denied Yoon masterminded an insurrection, a crime in South Korea punishable by life imprisonment or even, technically, the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with its worst political crisis in decades, sparked by Yoon's attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that stunned the nation and was swiftly voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached on December 14 and he faces a Constitutional Court trial that started this week to decide whether to permanently suspend his powers or return him to office. (Reuters)

<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan says the government hopes to achieve a fiscal balance in three years. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788035_1_20250117181925.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was pushed to the limit in setting up an Australian Open showdown with teenager Mirra Andreeva on Friday but Naomi Osaka's run ended with an injury retirement in round three.
 <br>
  <br>
  Women's World No. 1 Sabalenka was made to work hard behind a faltering serve before beating Denmark's Clara Tauson in the third round on Rod Laver Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was broken four straight times at the start of the match but found her groove to win 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 after more than two hours of attritional tennis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just super happy that I was able to just stay in the game and I was able to push myself, honestly, to the limit to get this win," said Sabalenka, who is chasing a rare third Melbourne title in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her win puts her into a clash against highly rated 17-year-old Andreeva, the 14th seed, who beat Poland's 23rd seed Magdalena Frech in three sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Andreeva announced her burgeoning talent by beating Sabalenka in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two-time Melbourne champion Osaka was on a collision course with American third seed Coco Gauff in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former world number one needed treatment on her stomach from the trainer during the first set against Belinda Bencic and called it quits after losing the opener on a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osaka, who was struggling with an abdominal injury in the build-up to the tournament and retired from the final in Auckland, was in the third round of a Slam for the first time since the birth of her daughter in 2023. (AFP)

    Govt raises travel alert for parts of Myanmar to red

<img alt="The Security Bureau has raised the travel alert level for parts of Myanmar to red." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788030_1_20250117174108.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday raised its travel alert for southeastern Myanmar to red, following cases of Hongkongers being lured there and forced to work at scam farms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red is the middle level of the government's three-tier outward travel alert system, meaning there is a significant threat of going to the place and people should avoid making non-essential trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau is calling on people to avoid non-essential travel to four districts of the country, while keeping the alert level at amber for other parts of Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residents who plan to visit south-eastern regions of Myanmar, including Myawaddy district, Hpapun district, Hpa-An district, and Kawkareik district should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel there," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said for those who are already there, they should monitor the situation, exercise caution and attend to their personal safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  While officials said they have received reports that some Hong Kong people are also trapped in Cambodia, security officials have kept the alert level for the country at amber.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they've updated the website with new information, to remind people to exercise caution and beware of overseas job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang told a HOY TV programme on Friday that the alert was raised because it is now riskier for Hongkongers to be in those districts in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are currently no plans to raise the travel alert for Thailand -- where some victims had initially gone to before being taken to scam farms.

 Hong Kong's stock market ended higher on Friday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.31 percent to close at 19,584 points.

  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index also closed up 0.3 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three lawyers who once represented the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were jailed on Friday in Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vadim Kobzev, Igor Sergunin and Alexei Liptser were jailed from 3.5 to five years by a court in the town of Petushki, about 100 kilometres east of Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were arrested in October 2023 on charges of involvement with extremist groups, as Navalny’s networks were deemed extremist by authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was widely seen as a way to increase pressure on the opposition to discourage defence lawyers from taking political cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, Navalny was serving a 19-year prison term on several criminal convictions, including extremism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He died in a Russian prison camp in February 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested in 2021 upon his return from Germany, where he was recuperating from a nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ordered to serve 2.5 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two more trials, his sentence was extended to 19 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and his allies said the charges were politically motivated and accused the Kremlin of seeking to jail him for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, Navalny was moved from a penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow to one above the Arctic Circle, where he died in February at the age of 47 under still-unexplained circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and members of his team alleged he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian government has rejected the accusation. (AP)

    HK to see more opportunity than challenges in 2025: FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

    Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan jailed for 14 years

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court on Friday convicted former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in a landmark graft case, sentencing Khan to 14 years in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been held in custody since August 2023 charged with around 200 cases, but his party claim the latest conviction was being used to pressure him into silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief," Khan told reporters inside the court room after his conviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-graft court convened in the jail near the capital Islamabad where Khan is being held, and convicted him along with his wife over a welfare foundation they established together called the Al-Qadir Trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has proven its case. Khan is convicted," said Judge Nasir Javed Rana, announcing a 14 year sentence for Khan and seven years for Bibi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith healer Bibi, who was recently released on bail, was arrested at the court after the conviction, her spokeswoman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan maintains the cases are politically motivated and designed to keep him from returning to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentence has been delayed several times over the past month, with analysts saying the jail term was being used to pressure Khan into accepting a deal with the military to step back from politics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since being ousted from power in 2022, Khan has launched an unprecedented campaign in which he has openly criticised the country's powerful generals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan had previously been handed four convictions, two of which have been overturned while the sentences in the other two cases were suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he remained in prison over pending cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN panel of experts found last year that Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office".
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February's election and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were hamstrung by a widespread crackdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI won more seats than any other party in the poll, but a coalition of parties considered more pliable to the influence of the military establishment shut them out of power. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say an 18-year-old woman has lost around HK$9.2 million after falling for a phone scam.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources said on Friday that the mainland woman is a University of Hong Kong student. They also said police have put five suspects on their wanted list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the woman received a call almost two months ago from somebody claiming to be a mainland law enforcement officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  She reported being told she was implicated in a money laundering investigation and had to repeatedly transfer money to another bank account as part of the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the transfers were made, the scammers cut off contact, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force has listed the case as obtaining property by deception, with no arrests made so far.

    'Bamboo scaffolding ban not a wise move'

<img alt="The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions has called for enhanced training for safety supervisors at construction sites: Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787994_1_20250117144702.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group representing scaffolding workers on Friday said they opposed the idea of stopping the use of bamboo scaffolding in construction.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak injured 11 workers earlier this week, sparking conversations about completely replacing bamboo with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Friday, the group said they believe the many incidents involving scaffolding were caused by poor site safety management, not the safety of bamboo scaffolding structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Ping-tak, from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Union, noted that currently more than 80 percent of sites use bamboo scaffolding and thousands of workers would be affected if it were banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think about the sustainable development of bamboo scaffolding in the construction industry. If people insist on hindering our development, it could cost some 4,000 scaffolding workers their jobs, hurting the livelihood of some 4,000 households,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged the government and various stakeholders to join hands and come up with a long-term plan to improve construction procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions called for more training for safety inspectors at construction sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said more than 16 percent of 310 respondents to a recent survey said they had been injured at least once in industrial accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, one safety supervisor should be appointed to every 20 workers at a construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  But lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who also chairs the federation, said many supervisors receive inadequate training and were not qualified to guide workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From our survey, many workers believe that there's nobody to supervise them and monitor them and tell them about their occupational health and safety issues,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The supervisor may be a general worker and they do not receive professional training and so in fact they cannot play the function of the safety supervisor... So we hope that the government can strengthen their professional training and also strengthen their role.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reacting to the Kai Tak incident, Lam said it was not optimal that a serious accident occurred just months after the government published a revised safety code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said other than enhanced inspections, the government should also consider whether sites can use other materials to replace bamboo scaffolding at construction sites.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fond memories of travels to the mainland are likely to come flooding back for visitors to the MTR's exhibition at Hung Hom as the Kowloon-Canton Railway Through Train pulls into the station again for the first time in years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Compartments from the doubler-decker KTT trains which ran to Dongguan and Guangzhou from 1998 to 2020 have been added to the Station Rail Voyage experiential gallery which is designed to give people a behind-the-scenes glimpse of railway operations, along with a trip down memory lane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through showcasing the KTT compartments at the Station Rail Voyage exhibition, we bring everyone back to the days of the through train platform at Hung Hom Station," MTR CEO Jason Kam said at an opening ceremony for the revamped exhibition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These journeys bring back memories of visiting family, meeting friends or doing business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said the exhibition has proved popular with locals and tourists alike, and is also a hotspot for social media influencers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the success of the exhibition shows that Hong Kong should make use of heritage such as the MTR when designing attractions for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revamped exhibition will be open from January 23 until the end of the year. People can book a free visit via the MTR's website.

<img alt="The total number of births was 9.54 million in 2024, slightly lower than the number of deaths which stood at 10.93 million. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787977_1_20250117125825.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the number of deaths outpacing a slight increase in births.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics said the total number of people in China dropped by 1.39 million to 1.408 billion in 2024, compared to 1.409 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of births was 9.54 million versus 9.02 million in 2023, the bureau said. The birth rate rose to 6.77 births per 1,000 people in 2024 versus 6.39 per 1,000 people in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of deaths was 10.93 million in 2024, down from 11.1 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet.
  <br>
  <br>
  China three years ago joined countries with falling populations, including Japan and most of Eastern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland authorities unveiled a series of measures in 2024 to boost the country’s birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December they urged colleges and universities to integrate marriage and "love education" into their curriculums to emphasise positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the State Council rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spreading respect for childbearing and marriage "at the right age".
  <br>
  <br>
  Data released on Friday showed the number of people aged 60 and over reached 310.31 million -- just a few percentage points short of a quarter of the country and an increase from the nearly 297 million recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, officials said they would gradually raise the statutory retirement age from 60, which was among the lowest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Gietel-Basten, an expert in population policy from the University of Science and Technology, said high living costs and social changes contributed to low fertility rates in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've had the aftermath of Covid and the kind of slowdown of the economy. We have relatively high unemployment rates among young people and the challenges of getting a job, but also getting a house, getting a family started,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rather than focusing only on boosting birth rates, Gietel-Basten said mainland officials should think of ways to improve quality of life and work-life balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People would like to have children, but there's just these institutional barriers in place which are preventing people from having the number of children that they would like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we have to focus on understanding those barriers, breaking them down, not just to increase the fertility rate for its own sake, but to actually make people's lives happier.” (Additional reporting from agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said the new SKYTOPIA development planned as part of an expansion of Airport City will boost tourism-related industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority says the development will include a "one-stop arts hub" and a "jet fresh market".
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow welcomed the move, saying it will boost the economy by bringing more tourists to the city and creating jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that now is also a good time for more flights routes to be introduced, to further enhance the SAR's status as a global aviation hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the third runway already launched, we believe that we always need to connect more direct air services to more jurisdictions, including Europe and North America,” Chow said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority says SKYTOPIA will cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion for infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Rock Chen, who’s a member of the authority's board, said many potential investors have expressed an interest in funding the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hopes to collaborate with Art Basel to stage events, as well as art sales to attract collectors, entrepreneurs and artists to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calvin Au, a researcher at the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank said having interesting facilities around the airport could attract people to choose to use Chek Lap Kok for their travels.

    China economy expands 5 percent in 2024

<img alt="China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Friday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787956_1_20250117101930.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the nation's growth for 2024, NBS commissioner Kang Yi touched on the challenges at home and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2024 witnessed a complex international environment... and there was a lack of efficient demand, and pains in the shift of growth drivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all that, the Chinese economy withstood pressures, overcame difficulties, making a new contribution to global growth," Kang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), said it was in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the troubled property sector remains a concern, despite slight improvements in new domestic home prices, with those in first-tier cities edging up 0.2 percent last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still too early to conclude if there is a stablisation in the property market. Of course the property prices in both the first-hand and secondary markets seemed to have improved, but they are still contracting, still in the negative region on a monthly basis," he said, adding that transaction volumes still dropped around 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really need to see an overall improvement of the property prices, a sustainable improvement, because the wealth effect determines whether households are willing to spend, and also affects the assessment of the economic prospects in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities have begun preparations to resume group tours to Taiwan by residents of Shanghai and Fujian province in the near future, the culture and tourism ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to resume such tours since the end of Covid-19, and have blamed each other for the lack of progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The culture and tourism ministry said in a short statement that the resumption of group tours from Shanghai, as well as from Fujian province, which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait from the island, would happen soon. However, it did not give a date for the resumption of travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was being done in order to further promote the normalisation of people-to-people exchanges and "enhance the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait," the ministry said. (Reuters)

    Diallo's 12-minute hat-trick rescues Man Utd

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick as Manchester United roared back to beat Premier League basement club Southampton 3-1, narrowly avoiding a humiliating fourth straight home defeat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ivory Coast international – United's standout player this season – levelled in the 82nd minute before putting the hosts ahead in the dying seconds of the 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was still not done, capitalising on an error from Taylor Harwood-Bellis to grab a third in stoppage time, giving the scoreline a skewed look.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history, still with just one win to their name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Juric's men had deservedly taken the lead through a Manuel Ugarte own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diallo was once again the saviour for misfiring United following his winning goal at Manchester City and his late equaliser against Liverpool in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we showed at the end we were the best team," the winger said. "I am so happy for the win today because this team deserves it. I am ready to play every position where the manager likes to put me."
  <br>
  <br>
  United manager Ruben Amorim praised his forward, underlining his attacking threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He pushes the other team into the final third – that is really important," he said. "We didn't have a good game, but at this moment – winning is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  United secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool. (AFP)

    Retail sales figures cast pall over US markets

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower as investors digested the latest US retail figures. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787923_1_20250117063623.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lacklustre."
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December. That was slower than November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high.
  <br>
  <br>
  After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group said there were "threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment," Brooks added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors remain cautious ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2 percent to 43,153.13, the S&P 500 also lost 0.2 percent to 5,937.34, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 percent to 19,338.29.  (AFP)

    Medvedev stunned by teen qualifier Tien in Aussie Open

<img alt="Tien (L) speaks with Russia's Daniil Medvedev after his victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787918_1_20250117054531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Daniil Medvedev was dumped out in the Australian Open second round by 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien in a massive Melbourne shock at close to 3:00 a.m. Melbourne time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his debut Australian Open, the American ranked 121 stunned the world number five 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (8/10), 1-6, 7-6 (10/7) in a nailbiter and faces France's Corentin Moutet in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The left-handed Californian Tien soaked up the applause at Margaret Court Arena after the biggest win of his young career following four hours and 48 minutes of seesawing action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly it hasn't really set in yet," he said. "I'm just pretty happy to be off the court. I don't think I've played a match that long ever, or even spent that much time on a tennis court straight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I'm just glad to be off," he added. "Obviously really happy, but I don't think it fully hit me yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien had defeated Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli in five sets in the first round for his maiden victory at a Grand Slam at the fourth attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are my first two five-setters," said the gifted teenager, a known talent in tennis circles. "It is nice to feel that I can play these more physical matches and get through them."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a painful exit for Russia's former world number one Medvedev, who has lost three of the last four finals at Melbourne Park including to Jannik Sinner in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Medvedev needed five sets to beat the 418th-ranked Kasidit Samrej on Tuesday in his first match of the season, smashing his racquet and a net camera in a rage at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  He started more serenely against Tien but errors crept into his play and Tien shook off any early nerves by clinching the first set in 47 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien showed his mettle and his pedigree in the eighth game by prevailing in one gruelling 32-shot rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2021 US Open champion Medvedev and Tien went to a second-set tie break, where the Russian was left exasperated by a double foot fault on his way to losing the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third set again went to a tie break, where Medvedev pulled out an ace under excruciating pressure to save match point and then clinched the set at the third time of asking to come back from the brink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suddenly it was all Medvedev and he raced through the fourth set to tee up a decider. Tien appeared to have run out of steam.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from somewhere he located some extra reserves of energy and the duo exchanged breaks early in the fifth set.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was still time for another twist at 5-5 and 15-all on Tien's serve when a shower came, briefly holding up proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  They exchanged breaks of serve to go into a 10-point tie break, where there was again nothing between them until Tien finally sealed the deal on his second match point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested a man for using forged documents and making false crime reports, after he allegedly fabricated an email from the Kai Tak Sports Park and separately claimed he was the victim of a blackmail case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers alleged that the man released a press statement earlier this month claiming that his application to host an international football event -- featuring FC Barcelona -- at the new stadium was rejected, and included what he claimed was an email from the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it never received any application documents about the proposed match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the suspect also filed a false police report claiming that a journalist covering the story blackmailed him for HK$10 million via an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Yi-ki, a chief inspector with the force, said officers believe both emails were forged by the suspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police do not rule out that the suspect may have been overly optimistic about his ability to organise international events. When his plan failed due to inexperience and poor management, he tried to shift the responsibility by misleading the media and forging emails that falsely claimed Kai Tak Sports Park had rejected his venue application," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Tak Sports Park said it is willing to cooperate with the police probe and will continue to handle all leasing applications in a professional manner.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States cooled in December, according to government data released on Thursday, despite receiving a boost from petrol stations and autos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The performance was likely helped by replacement vehicle sales after the devastation of Hurricane Helene in September, analysts said, and consumers buying cars earlier to avoid potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But still, overall, sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, reaching US$729.2 billion, the Department of Commerce said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a slower pace than November's 0.8 percent reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, retail sales were up 3.9 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  For all of 2024, total sales were 3.0 percent higher from 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among sectors, sales at restaurants and bars slid 0.3 percent from November to December, while those at building material and supplies dealers dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at motor vehicle and parts dealers, sales rose 0.7 percent on-month, while those at petrol stations jumped 1.5 percent – likely due to higher petrol prices in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Attempts to get ahead of post-tariff price hikes seem to be lifting measures of underlying retail sales," said economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a recent note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they warned: "Sales (that) pulled forward due to hurricane damage and the threat of tariffs, or a passing boost from the shifting timing of Black Friday, do not provide the foundation for a sustained climb in spending." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they arrested 12 people, including seven police officers, on suspicion of money laundering, involving about HK$10.5 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the force said the eight men and four women, aged between 28 and 68, allegedly laundered suspected criminal proceeds using 22 bank accounts between 2017 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the detained officers were also arrested for suspected fraud. They’d allegedly rented out their mortgaged residential properties between 2019 and last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers from the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau arrested the 12 people in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Tuen Mun and Kwai Chung on Thursday morning. The police officers were off-duty at the time of the arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said all seven officers, aged between 28 and 39, have been suspended from duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities stressed they attach great emphasis on the conduct of their officers, adding that those who breach the law will not be condoned.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said a Hongkonger who was rescued after being trapped in Southeast Asia was forced to work 17 hours a day and beaten for not meeting targets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the victim, 25, was lured by a social media job advertisement offering HK$120,000 to transport diamonds from Thailand to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  After arriving in Bangkok last October, he was taken to Myanmar and held in a mountain compound guarded by armed men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-tak, a chief inspector with the force, said the victim was forced to conduct online scams on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past three months, the victim was repeatedly beaten and denied meals because he failed to meet the fraud targets set by management staff at the compound. There are still visible injuries on his body," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police did not disclose whether the victim's family paid ransom in this case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they are still in contact with some of the remaining 11 Hongkongers held captive in Southeast Asia and are trying all means to rescue them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force warned members of the public to stay vigilant against overseas job offers that promise high salaries without requiring professional skills.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland said on Thursday that it’s pleased with the theme park’s performance last year in terms of visitor numbers and revenue, and expects it to continue doing very well this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme park’s vice president for communications and public affairs, Anita Lai, said the new 'World of Frozen' attraction, which opened in November 2023, was a big draw for tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A year ago, we launched 'World of Frozen'. This is a movie and a story that people love,” Lai told reporters, adding that there’s been a surge in the number of mainland tourists buying the park’s annual pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that there was a double-digit growth in the number of Shenzhen visitors during last year’s Halloween compared to the same period in 2023, and that Hong Kong Disneyland Resort hotels reached 90 percent occupancy during the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the park will step up promotions in both the mainland and Southeast Asian countries to entice more visitors during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the park is worried about vigorous competition with Ocean Park -- which will be putting the twin panda cubs on display next month -- Lai said Hong Kong Disneyland welcomes new events and highlights to inject momentum into the city's tourism industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Australian mother has been charged with poisoning her one-year-old baby girl and posting video of the infant's distress to get online GoFundMe donations, police and local media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old woman allegedly went to "great lengths" to conceal that she was giving prescription and pharmacy drugs to the baby without medical approval, Queensland detective inspector Paul Dalton told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital staff in the Queensland capital Brisbane alerted police to their suspicions in October last year when the girl was there for treatment of a serious mental condition, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police took "immediate action" to protect the baby and launched an investigation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman from Queensland's Sunshine Coast was widely reported in local media to be the baby's mother, though police would not officially confirm this.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was accused of filming and posting images of the baby's "immense distress and pain" between August and October last year to elicit financial donations from online followers, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Testing for unauthorised medicines allegedly returned a positive result this month, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was charged on Thursday with 11 offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no words to describe just how repulsive offences of this nature are," Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no excuse for hurting a child, particularly one so young that is totally dependent on adults to care and love for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman is accused of raising just over Aus$60,000 (US$37,000) via GoFundMe, which was working to return the money to donors, Dalton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was scheduled to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Thursday accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal announced a day earlier, and said the cabinet will not meet on the deal until Hamas's agreement is confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has reneged on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last-minute concessions," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the situation created a "last minute crisis."
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify which parts of the deal were at issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the Israeli cabinet, which has yet to approve the agreement, "will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Key mediator Qatar said on Wednesday that Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza starting on Sunday, along with a hostage and prisoner exchange after more than 15 months of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States also announced the deal, which largely reproduces the framework of a blueprint presented by President Joe Biden in May 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three Israeli hostages will be released in the first, 42-day, phase of the agreement, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong is the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to expand their business overseas, as Tencent-backed digital lender WeBank opened a Hong Kong headquarters for its new tech arm.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inauguration and signing ceremony for WeBank Technology, Chan said the city's financial technology ecosystem has seen positive growth in recent years, with the number of firms in the sector growing 15 percent year-on-year to 1,100 in 2024, including eight digital banks and four digital insurance companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong has the unique advantage to connect the mainland with the world, and is also the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to go overseas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have a full chain of financing and professional services, this could support WeBank Technology to export its advanced tech and explore business expansion in the international market, especially, to provide more inclusive financial services to countries in the Global South to support local social and economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen vice-mayor Luo Huanghao, who also attended the event, said the mainland's tech hub will collaborate with Hong Kong to further promote the application of the digital yuan through more trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank president Li Nanqing said the opening of the new headquarters in Hong Kong can help the company expand along Belt and Road countries and boost economic integration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank gained regulatory approval to set up its fintech subsidiary in Hong Kong last July and plans to invest up to US$150 million and create high-skilled jobs in the SAR.

 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.

  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The R&D centre at Hong Kong's Automotive Platforms and Applications Systems (APAS) on Thursday warned electric vehicle (EV) owners to be careful when charging their cars on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre said most EVs in Hong Kong use either Japanese or American charging standards and an adaptor is usually needed to charge them on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such adaptors are hard to find, the centre said, with those that are available coming with a price tag of between several thousand and tens of thousands of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a lack of standardisation regarding safety when it comes to the adaptors, the centre said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive Officer of the centre Du Yonghai said to help solve these problems, they are developing their own adaptor which they plan to make commercially available.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been actively engaging with several partners so that we can commercialise that product, that solution and make it available to the market," Du said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, about 100,000 electronic vehicles were registered in Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan was stabbed in a scuffle with an intruder at his home early on Thursday and underwent surgery at a hospital, media reports said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old actor was taken to the hospital from his home in Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, where he lives with his movie star wife Kareena Kapoor and two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the six wounds were deep, with one near his spine, the Press Trust of India news agency cited a doctor at Mumbai’s Lilavati Hospital as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian media quoted police as saying the intruder barged into the house at about 2.30am and fled after stabbing Khan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A female employee at Khan's home was also injured during the attack and was being treated, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are investigating and have launched a search for the attacker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kapoor, Khan' wife, said in a statement that his family was fine and requested “the media and fans to be patient and not speculate any further as the police is already doing their due investigations.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan, who is also a movie producer, has been featured in about 70 films and television series.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the son of former Indian cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won multiple awards for his roles in Hindi cinema, including seven Filmfare Awards. In 2010, he received the Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Thursday unveiled a new development called "SKYTOPIA" for Hong Kong's Airport City, aiming to develop it into a world-class landmark.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority unveiled the Airport City development blueprint which includes measures to expand AsiaWorld-Expo, build the city’s largest yacht bay, and set up the city’s first art storage facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-runway system at the airport commenced operation in November last year, and will boost the airport’s capacity to 120 million passengers a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Airport Authority, Fred Lam, said the Airport City will be more than just about serving travellers using the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We envisage that our airport will not be just a place for passengers to board their planes or a portal for entering Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our vision is to develop SKYTOPIA into a landmark of its own and also a world leading destination, attracting visitors from within Hong Kong and its prosperous Greater Bay Area, as well as major markets in Asia and around the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cissy Chan, an executive director with the authority, said the Airport City will integrate commercial and cultural activities, and will be a key economic driver for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the project would not only consolidate Hong Kong’s status as an international aviation hub, but also boost the city’s development in art trading and entertainment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority said the project would cost about HK$100 billion, including HK$30 billion on infrastructure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they believe they have caught one of four people who raided a jewellery store in Sheung Shui on Wednesday evening and the man, 23, will be charged with robbery.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jewellery worth HK$1.5 million was stolen from a shop on San Fung Avenue by a group of people wielding knives and hammers who escaped in a private car, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weapons believed to be linked to the raid were later found in a car involved in a crash on Lam Kam Road, while clothes and masks officers suspect were worn by the robbers were found on a nearby hillside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through our investigation, we suspect that the vehicle that we mentioned had been surveilling the crime scene a couple of days before the incident took place," Chief Inspector Law Like-him said at a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suspect this shows it was a pre-planned, organised crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was arrested in Pat Heung in the early hours of Thursday, is expected to appear in Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts on Saturday, police said.
