 People around the globe marked World Sleep Day on Friday, an annual event that serves as a reminder of the importance of sleep to one's well-being and health.
 <br>
  <br>

  </a>
  , Julia Sun, a clinical psychologist at the Chinese University's Department of Psychiatry, said people should not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sleep is really important and it is related to the physical and mental well-being. Physically, chronic sleep depravation will lead to reduced immune function and hormonal imbalance. And also we can see that when people sleep less, they tend to gain more weight. Sleep depravation is also linked to increased cardiovascular risk," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of mental well-being, insomnia, or sleeping less, leads to increased irritability... it also leads to more mood swings and also difficulty in managing stress."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun recommended that people get into a routine before bed, to ensure a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that regularity is important - try to have a regular sleep-wake schedule no matter in weekdays or weekends... try to limit the screen use before sleep, for example like 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. And also you can dim your light before you go to sleep."

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks prank

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

<img alt="DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam welcomed government proposals to extend the storage time for eggs, sperm and embryos in Hong Kong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795688_1_20250314110717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam on Friday welcomed the government's initiative on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Thursday announced it would launch a public consultation on issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>

   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said many people were starting families later in life which is why an adjustment to current regulations was needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More and more couples are getting married late and planning their families late... and if you look at some of the restrictions to current [regulations] we're having such as this 10-year period, it's pretty much outdated. We do need a full-on upgrade of a lot of the rules and regulations around this to ensure that it fits with current trends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said easing restrictions on non-married couples or single people, allowing them to use their frozen embryos to start a family, would also help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment it might be a little bit tricky, but we do need to do more persuasive discussions in Hong Kong," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam, speaking on a RTHK programme,  said the proposed measure was helpful, but people also needed to understand that, if possible, it is better to start a family sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to let people know that this option is not for everyone, it is a choice for those with a unique problem. It should not become an option for people to delay childbearing. We should have children as early as possible.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that pregnancy difficulties and health risks would increase as women get older which was another reason not to delay starting a family.

<img alt="Bruno Fernandes was decisive for Manchester United with his hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795685_1_20250314104926.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes netted a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday, while Tottenham bounced back to edge AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rangers knocked out Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-2 on penalties as Chelsea saw out a 1-0 home win against Copenhagen to ensure their place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two spot-kicks and a late arrowed finish from Fernandes sent Man Utd into the quarter-finals by a 5-2 aggregate margin against 10-man Sociedad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it," Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim said of his captain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  A 10th-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead at Old Trafford before Fernandes converted from 12 yards in the 16th and 50th minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Aramburu saw red shortly after the hour and Man Utd took full advantage with Fernandes rifling in a third three minutes from time and Diogo Dalot rubber-stamping an emphatic victory in injury-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side will meet Lyon in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals in either half from Wilson Odobert and James Maddison in London earned Spurs a 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert powered home following sloppy AZ defending to get Spurs level on aggregate in the 26th minute, after the first leg finished 1-0 to the Dutch side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maddison put the hosts 2-0 up three minutes into the second period with an arrowed finish before Peer Koopmeiners responded after the hour to level the tie again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert grabbed his second and Spurs' third on the night in the 74th minute to set up a quarter-final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times," Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing the first leg in Istanbul 3-1, Fenerbahce fought back at Rangers to win 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski produced two cute finishes in the 45th and 73rd minutes to force extra-time with the aggregate score locked at three-apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  But three missed spot-kicks by the Turkish side handed Rangers a 3-2 win in the shoot-out and a last-eight clash with Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall got the winner 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea through the Conference League quarter-finals at the expense of Copenhagen, 3-1 over both legs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen of China 6-3, 6-3, avenging her Olympics semi-final loss to the Paris Games gold medallist, to reach the last four at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number two from Poland will get a chance to avenge another upset loss in the semi-finals, where she'll take on Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who stunned her in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek delivered another dominant performance as she continued her bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who won her first Indian Wells title in 2022, could also join Martina Navratilova as the only women to lift the trophy in back-to-back years.
  <br>
  <br>
  After dropping just two games in each of her first three matches, Swiatek was broken twice as she faced her toughest test so far, but secured the victory with a flourish as she broke Zheng at love in the final game after a brief shower paused play late in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek converted all five of her break chances. Zheng twice surrendering her serve in games she led 40-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng did manage late breaks in each set, but neither those hiccups nor the brief shower that paused play in the second set proved much impediment to Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end it got really windy, which made it super tricky," Swiatek said. ""When the conditions change during the match you need to adjust quickly and it's not that easy. I'm happy that I was pushing until the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek admitted she was pleased to avenge her Olympic defeat, a heartbreaking loss on the Philippe Chatrier court where the Polish star has won four French Open titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not nice to lose to anybody, so for sure you want to have a little, like revenge, but it's nothing personal," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She can settle another score against Andreeva, who kept her bid for another prestigious title on track with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Ukrainian veteran Elina Svitolina. (AFP)

<img alt='Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Jones should "take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there." Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795670_1_20250314091432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

    Duterte's first court appearance set for Friday

<img alt="People protest against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in front of the ICC in the Hague. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795667_1_20250314085246.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Trump threatens tariffs on EU alcohol

<img alt="President Trump's tariff threat could hit a market worth US$10 billion to EU producers in 2023, according to World Trade Organization figures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795656_1_20250314055609.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)

<img alt="Before trading began, Washington unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday on a fresh wave of tariff threats by US President Donald Trump, and despite producer inflation remaining flat.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 percent to 40,813, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.4 percent to 5,521.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost nearly two percent to 17,303.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P drop means the index has tumbled into a correction, or down 10 percent from its highest point of the year, recorded just last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before trading began, Trump unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  His threat came after the EU announced a series of countermeasures against new US steel and aluminum tariffs, including a sharp hike targeting US whiskey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would make good on his threat if the bloc's planned whiskey levy "is not removed immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, government data also showed that the producer price index was flat in February, after a 0.6 percent rise in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's pretty good news in terms of inflation but the problem is, you have a trade war that's expanding," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  While recent inflation reports have been encouraging, Cardillo added that markets are wary as the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, alongside Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on the economy. (AFP)

    Pro-Palestinian protesters fill NY's Trump Tower

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people poured into the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to protest the arrest and detention of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom the Trump administration aims to deport over his pro-Palestinian activism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arrest of Khalil, who is in immigration custody in Louisiana after his arrest in New York on Saturday, has sparked an outcry by Democratic lawmakers, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian territories, and civil liberty advocates, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jewish Voice for Peace, which describes itself as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organisation, carried out Thursday's demonstration. The group said it was "taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people," the group said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Tower, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, is home to the Trump Organisation and where President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump own a penthouse apartment. Their son, Barron, has been living there since beginning his freshman year at New York University in the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 150 protesters gathered at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the New York Police Department estimated. Images on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs saying: "FIGHT NAZIS NOT STUDENTS" and "FREE MAHMOUD FREE PALESTINE."
  <br>
  <br>
  Video showed police arresting some of the protesters. The NYPD said 98 arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety, said on Fox News that there were no injuries and all the protesters had been removed from the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump Organisation did not immediately provide comment. By arresting Khalil on Saturday, the Trump administration began fulfilling its campaign promise to deport foreign-born activists who participated in the wave of protests on U.S. college campuses last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, has been a prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian student movement at Columbia, perhaps the most prominent of the dozens of U.S. universities where demonstrations erupted last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump branded Khalil a "Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student" on social media and has said his arrest is the first "of many to come." (Reuters)

    Putin agrees to ceasefire but raises 'questions'

<img alt="Putin makes his first comments on the plan, saying he's " for src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795644_1_20250314025202.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had "serious questions" about Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but Moscow was ready to discuss it with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putin made his first comments on the plan, which Ukraine agreed to on Tuesday at talks with the United States, saying he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances," and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin told reporters, "I think we need to talk to our American colleagues... Maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has called for Russia to agree to a ceasefire without any conditions, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying on Tuesday, "That's what we want to know, if they're prepared to do it unconditionally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've actually discussed many of the details of a final agreement." Now we're going to see if Russia is there, and, if not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After visiting a military headquarters in the Kursk region Wednesday, the Russian president hailed troops' progress against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump pushes for a speedy end to the more than three-year conflict, his envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has expressed optimism that his team can secure a ceasefire, despite Moscow's battlefield gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it'll never go back to war," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Thursday had criticised the lack of an official response from Moscow, saying on social media that this shows "Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of talks, Putin said, "We agree with proposals to cease hostilities, but on the basis that cessation would lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two primary schools will not receive grants from the Education Bureau to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year, because they failed to enrol the minimum 16 pupils required to form a class.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Aplichau Kaifong Primary School in Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau sent a letter to all government and subsidised primary schools on Thursday regarding the approval of classes and manpower planning for the 2025-26 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said if schools have any comments over the proposed class structure, they can submit feedback by March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted schools that don't receive grants can still request to run primary one classes with private funds, merge with other schools or close altogether.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said such schools can join the Primary One allocation a year later with special approval from the bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that no schools that faced bans on enrolling primary one students over the past six years are facing the same issue again.

  Ng came off an impressive victory over Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, coming from a game down in the last 32 to advance 19-21, 21-16, 21-12.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the SAR shuttler once again struggled against Loh, having lost all four of their previous encounters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng conceded the opening game 15-21, before falling 4-10 behind in game two. The Hong Kong representative stormed back to level things up at 14-all, but eventually succumbed to a 17-21 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loh will next face China's world number one, Shi Yuqi, who beat Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-19. Shi is the favourite in Birmingham following Victor Axelsen's surprise exit earlier on Thursday.

    Civil service job cuts won't save much: Legco

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to cut 10,000 civil service positions over two years may not translate into substantial manpower savings, according to a research brief released by the Legislative Council Secretariat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the report, the size of the civil service establishment exceeded the actual number of workers employed by 18,900 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coupled with a vacancy rate in civil service of around 10 percent right now, most of the 10,000 posts would not have been filled anyway, with or without the post deletion policy," the report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also examined the civil service pay freeze for the upcoming fiscal year. They projected potential savings of HK$8.7 billion, assuming a 3 percent market wage increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparing Hong Kong with other advanced economies in the Asia-Pacific region, the brief noted that civil servants made up 4.7 percent of the local workforce in 2023, higher than Singapore's 3.7 percent, and 4.2 percent for South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also concluded the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly remains competitive, even after putting a cap on the number of trips and changing the formula for long-haul journeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  It compared the measure to similar schemes in 12 other cities worldwide, and noted only London, Paris, Guangzhou and Singapore offer concessionary fares for commuters between 60 and 64.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the secretariat conceded the proposed tweaks will bring insignificant relief to public coffers, estimating savings of only HK$680 million each year.

    'No cryopreservation time limit helps the infertile'

<img alt="An expert has expressed doubts on whether the proposed amendments on cryopreservation can help lift Hong Kong's declining birth rate. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795595_1_20250313182427.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A population expert on Thursday welcomed the government's proposed amendments to lift the storage period limits for frozen gametes and embryos, saying it would be helpful for those who are infertile.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration said the plan would ease concerns of people who have difficulty conceiving, but he expressed doubts over whether the plan will help lift the city's declining birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those people who [have] gone through these exercises, we are not expecting to have a lot of people, and it is also quite expensive. So if we bet on…this measure [to] increase the total number of births substantially, I think it's a bit over-optimistic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the proposal is not a "panacea" to tackle the birth rate issue, and called on people who wish to have children to do so earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam pointed out that the proposal marks a pivotal moment in the city's approach to reproductive healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believes the move can help boost the success rate for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the pressure to use stored eggs within a decade often leads to a rush and costly treatment," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With an indefinite storage period, patients can take their time and potentially lead to a higher success rate and fewer IVF cycles needed."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the proposed amendments will allow people to conduct family planning on their own terms.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An upcoming exhibition dedicated to Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is set to bring a vibrant intercultural and intergenerational experience to Hong Kong as part of this year's French May Arts Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Picasso for Asia - A Conversation," the exhibition showcases over 60 of the maestro's masterpieces, alongside around 130 works from 30 Asian artists, including four from Hong Kong, who wish to pay tribute to or be linked with his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are connections that are clear expressions of admiration or homage when certain painters, very preeminent painters from our part of the world, paint images of Picasso based on photographs. I think that's a clear and active homage," said Doryun Chong, artistic director and chief curator at M+ museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But then we can also have more indirect conversations that can be sometimes commentary, tongue-in-cheek commentary, but then it can also be a subtle critique because Picasso was from a different time, and then society and our understanding of art's role and gender dynamics have changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By putting the more recent artworks by contemporary Asian artists next to Picasso's, we can also see continued relevance as well as passage of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the exhibition marks the first major showcase of Picasso's masterpieces here in over a decade, so he hopes visitors will get to see the late artist in a new way, despite how much they know about his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's as much about revealing Picasso as putting a lot of questions around the myth surrounding Picasso. I really hope that our audiences will also see in new light art that is made more recently from our part of the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kinds of art that they would feel more familiar with because they're from here, but by being next to Picasso, I hope that they will also see something new about modern and contemporary art from our part of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition will be open to the public at the M+ West Gallery from March 15 to July 13.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government launched on Thursday a consultation on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, people can store their gametes or embryos for up to 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cancer patients or people who are infertile because of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or other medical treatments can have their gametes stored for 10 years or until they are 55 years old, whichever is longer, while the storage period for embryos is 10 years at the most.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Council on Human Reproductive Technology is proposing to amend the existing code of practice on reproductive technology and embryo research to allow them to arrange storage for as long as they want.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it "will amend the operational measures in the code accordingly to ensure that the public is fully aware of the associated medical risks before engaging in unnecessary and prolonged storage of gametes or embryos without medical reasons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It also suggested that licensed centres must inform patients on the risks of egg-retrieval procedures, rapid decline in fertility or pregnancy rate associated with ageing of women, the risks of geriatric pregnancy, as well as the social impacts of delayed childbearing. Patients must sign a consent form of acknowledgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centres also have to provide counselling based on individual circumstances and seek written consent before extending the storage period.
  <br>
  <br>
  And they will need to provide statistical data to authorities for regulatory purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council is seeking opinions from stakeholders, including licensed centres and organisations, on the proposed changes until April 13.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver, who was behind the wheel of a light goods vehicle travelling along the West Kowloon Highway on Thursday, died after crashing into a fire engine in Tai Kok Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fatal accident occurred at about 2pm, near Olympian City.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver had initially been stuck in the van, which was severely damaged, before being brought to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed that there was also a white dump truck near the site of the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said the dump truck had earlier crashed into safety barriers along the road after a bird hit the vehicle's windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added the light van crashed into the fire engine which was responding to the dump truck driver's call for assistance.

    China urges diplomatic Iran nuclear solution

<div class="itemFullText">
 China called on Thursday for a "diplomatic" resolution to the Iran nuclear issue as it prepared to host diplomats from Tehran and Moscow for talks in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the current situation, we believe that all parties should maintain calm and restraint to avoid escalating the Iran nuclear situation, or even walking towards confrontation and conflict," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will be attended by Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from a landmark deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief during President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the 2015 deal for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said the upcoming talks would aim to "strengthen communication and coordination, to resume dialogue and negotiation at an early time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China sincerely hopes that all parties can work together, continuously increase mutual trust and dispel misgivings, and turn the momentum of restarting dialogue and negotiation into reality at an early date," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing has called for "dialogue" with Washington to resolve spiralling trade tensions that have seen the world's two largest economies impose a number of tariffs on each other's imports in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States and China will work together... to return to the correct track of resolving issues through dialogue and consultation," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian at a news conference. (AFP)

<img alt="The Office of the Ombudsman says it has found long-term cases of illegal parking in some public estates. Photo courtesy of Information Services Department" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795562_1_20250313152553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday urged the Housing Department to step up efforts to tackle illegal parking in public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog’s call to action comes after it inspected four estates that do not have vehicle gates installed at all entrances because of geographical constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are Yau Oi Estate, Cheung Hong Estate, Lai Yiu Estate and Queen's Hill Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said inspectors had found cases of long-term illegal parking in three of the estates apart from Yau Oi Estate, adding that some vehicles are even blocking emergency vehicle access in Lai Yiu Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the situation of illegal parking in Yau Oi Estate has improved after the department implemented enhancement measures, including the installation of an additional CCTV system, as well as the deployment of more patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As the case of Yau Oi Estate has shown, strengthening enforcement is indeed conducive to alleviating illegal parking. Overall, we urge the Housing Department to improve its handling of parking violations, especially to step up combating illegal parking along emergency vehicular access to minimise potential safety hazards,” Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog asked the department to step up enforcement against illegal parking blackspots, and to take immediate enforcement action against cars blocking emergency vehicle access.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged the department to set up key performance indicators for security service contractors, as well as to work more closely with the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department said it accepts the Ombudsman's suggestions, and promised to improve existing measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will work with other government departments to conduct joint operations to resolve the issue.

 The bodies of at least 25 people, including 21 hostages, killed in a train siege by separatist gunmen in Pakistan were retrieved from the site yesterday ahead of the first funerals, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security forces said they freed more than 340 passengers in a two-day rescue operation that ended late on Wednesday after a separatist group bombed a remote track in mountainous southwest Balochistan and stormed a train with around 450 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, one of a number of separatist groups that accuse outsiders of plundering natural resources in Balochistan near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Death tolls have varied, with the military saying that "21 innocent hostages" were killed as well as four soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A railway official said the bodies of the 25 people were transported by train away from the site of the siege to the nearby town of Mach on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who escaped said after walking for hours through rugged mountains to reach safety that they saw people being shot dead by militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first funerals are expected to take place on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was also expected to visit Balochistan, his office said. (AFP)

<img alt="HKU’s dentistry course sits at the number-two spot when compared with its global peers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795543_1_20250313124205.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 70 percent of local university courses have seen their global rankings rise, compared to last year’s results.
 <br>
  <br>
  UK-based higher education analytics firm QS announced on Thursday that among them, six courses offered by two universities in the SAR have been listed in the global top 10 in their respective fields, two more compared with the results in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them is the University of Hong Kong’s dentistry course, which sits at the number-two spot when compared with its global peers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's education course, meanwhile, rose to number three globally, and its linguistics and geography courses ranked ninth and tenth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese University’s nursing course rose to number five on the global table, with its linguistics course coming in at number 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than HKU and CUHK, seven courses from the Polytechnic University (PolyU) were ranked among the global top 30, while four courses from the City University (CityU) entered the global top 50 list.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU's veterinary science, meanwhile, entered the global top 100 ranking for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, QS highlighted that the city is one of the top higher education centres in the world for data science and artificial intelligence, as five universities that offer such subjects were ranked among the top 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it expressed concerns over the SAR’s decision to cut education funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This remarkable progress marks a strong resurgence, reaffirming Hong Kong’s position as a leading hub for academic excellence – though planned cuts to higher education funding raise concerns about the sector’s ability to maintain its current momentum and global competitiveness,” the firm said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the survey this year is the largest in terms of scale, involving over 175,000 academics and over 100,000 employers, and covering over 18,300 subjects at over 1,700 universities in the world.

    Cancer devices donated by Li require clinical trials

<img alt="HKU says 40 patients have been treated with the donated device over the past six months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795541_1_20250313123550.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said medical devices donated by a tycoon for treating liver cancer are still under clinical trials and require careful evaluation before wider use in public healthcare.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Li Ka Shing Foundation announced it would donate histotripsy machines for liver cancer treatment to the Chinese University and University of Hong Kong (HKU), as well as the Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of these devices will be relocated from HKU's medical school to Gleneagles Hospital to treat the private facility's patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint response, the Health Bureau, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority said they expect data from the clinical trials to provide scientific evidence for broader applications in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clinical trials should be distinguished from clinical services. No clinical service may be provided when a clinical trial is still unfinished," officials wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  When introducing new medical devices, the authority looks at safety and therapeutic effectiveness and the decisions are not influenced by whether treatments are provided or sponsored by manufacturers, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The application in the public healthcare system of new drugs and medical devices, and methods for treatment that are still in the clinical trial phase without sufficient clinical data, should be handled in a very careful and prudent manner," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donated devices have to be listed under the voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System to ensure medical devices meet safety and quality requirements, officials added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to RTHK inquiries, HKU said 40 patients have been treated over the past six months with the device it has been given and that it is still in the research phase.

    'Students may have contracted gastroenteritis in HK'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Society for Infectious Diseases on Thursday said it would "not be surprising" if some students might have already caught norovirus – which can cause gastroenteritis – before departing for an exchange trip on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 secondary students and teachers from three local schools who had eaten meals at the same restaurants on an exchange trip to Shaoguan, Guangdong, were reported to have contracted gastroenteritis on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio show, Dr Wilson Lam revealed that norovirus activity has significantly increased globally compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the virus can be spread if there is vomit present.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, if there's a confined space in school buses or coaches, if a student vomited, it can absolutely cause students nearby to be infected," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or by having contact with areas where the virus has landed can also result in indirect contact transmission."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that hand sanitisers are ineffective against norovirus, and advised the public to wash their hands with soap instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Subsidised Secondary Schools Council chairman Lee Yi-ying revealed to the same programme that travel agencies will not allow schools to postpone tours if they suspect there may be infectious diseases at the destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  But schools can talk to agencies about visiting different attractions or restaurants, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that if a student feels unwell, teachers will take them to the doctor after they obtain their parents' consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Tang Fei told the same show that there are sufficient guidelines for schools to follow during study tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, at least one participating staff should have a first aid licence, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schools should activate the crisis management mechanism if they encounter similar cases, he added.

    Intel hires Malaysian veteran to head reboot

<img alt="Tan Lip Bu rejoins Intel as chief executive on Tuesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795538_1_20250313134923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Tan Lip Bu as the latest in a succession of chief executives to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job on Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous head, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.
  <br>
  <br>
  This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down in August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lip Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” interim executive chairman Frank Yeary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60 percent, wiping out US$160 billion in shareholder wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees — about 15 percent of its workforce — and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of US$19 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvida now boasts a market value of US$2.8 trillion compared to Intel's US$90 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel's stock price rose more than 10 percent in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military investigators charged two air force pilots on Thursday with criminal negligence over an accidental bombing of a village last week during a training exercise, which injured at least 29 people and caused extensive property damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry investigators have confirmed that errors by the pilots when they entered coordinates into the aircraft systems were "direct factors" behind the accidental bombing, the ministry's Criminal Investigation Command said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots were charged with criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the command said, adding the investigation of the incident is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight unguided air-to-surface bombs were launched from two fighter jets and landed on a village in Pocheon near the border with North Korea during live-fire exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several areas in Pocheon and neighbouring regions have training grounds used by the South Korean and US militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents have for years complained about potential safety risks and disturbances from military units being mobilised in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two pilots have been taken off flight duties and a review of their flight mission certification has been scheduled, a ministry official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air force chief of staff has apologised for the accident and pledged to review mission procedures to prevent similar incidents. (Reuters)

 Macau health authorities on Thursday said that a two-year-old girl from the SAR who was seriously injured in a shopping mall blast in Taichung has died.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspected gas explosion on February 13 hit the food court of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, killing four on the spot and injuring about 30 others.

  The Macau government announcement, made in the early hours of Thursday, noted that the girl had died on March 7, with authorities expressing deep sorrow over her passing and extending condolences to her family.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-year-old girl had been flown back to Macau on February 26. She was then brought directly to the Conde S Januario Hospital, where she was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A US judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the US Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document did not provide additional detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHS did not immediately responded to requests for comment from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights," Khalil's lawyer Ramzi Kassem said in court. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder punched their ticket to the playoffs with an impressive 118-112 victory over the reigning champion Boston Celtics in a potential NBA Finals sneak preview.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander enhanced his credentials as favourite for the Most Valuable Player award with a superb performance to silence Boston's TD Garden home crowd in an absorbing duel settled by a burst of fourth-quarter Thunder scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian point guard shot 11-of-20 from the field to finish with five rebounds, seven assists and 34 points, including 10-of-11 from the free throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City to 54-12, and guaranteed their place in next month's playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's win over a vastly more experienced Boston line-up marked another mature display from a Thunder side that is the youngest in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City effectively sealed victory late in the fourth, pulling away to open up a double-digit lead with just under two minutes remaining after Cason Wallace nailed a superb 24-foot three-pointer followed by a driving reverse layup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander said the Thunder's defensive solidity amid a barrage of 63 attempted threes from Boston had provided the foundation for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops, and that's been the trend for us recently," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're coming down the stretch against a good basketball team with good players, you've got to find a way, and we did so tonight and gave ourselves a chance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Gilgeous-Alexander grabbed the scoring headlines, the towering Chet Holmgren caught the eye with a double-double of 23 points with 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all the know the player Chet Holmgren is," Gilgeous-Alexander said of his 22-year-old team-mate. "He's a stud, and he's going to be stud for a very long time. He'll continue to grow and continue to be special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City's balanced offense meanwhile suggests that they are well-equipped to make a deep run in the postseason as they pursue the franchise's first NBA title since 1979, when the club were the Seattle SuperSonics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite missing Jaylin Williams from the line-up, the Thunder finished with seven players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston's scoring was led by Jayson Tatum with 33 points, while Derrick White had 22. Jaylen Brown though had an off-night, shooting 5-of-15 from the field before fouling out in the fourth quarter with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his team had failed to deal with Oklahoma City's physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of moments where we matched that and there were a few where we didn't, and I think stuff like that's the difference in the game," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795510_1_20250313085050.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over on Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier on Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte’s arrest, and the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Duterte criticised the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available "as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (AP)

<img alt="The megaphone-shaped telescope will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way during its planned two-year mission. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795461_1_20250312212209.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nasa telescope was launched into space from California on Tuesday for a mission to explore the origins of the universe and to search the Milky Way galaxy for hidden reservoirs of water, a key ingredient for life.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US space agency's megaphone-shaped SPHEREx – short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer – was carried aloft by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its planned two-year mission, the observatory will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way. It will create a three-dimensional map of the cosmos in 102 colors – individual wavelengths of light – and will study the history and evolution of galaxies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission aims to deepen the understanding of a phenomenon known as cosmic inflation, referring to the universe's rapid and exponential expansion from a single point in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SPHEREx is really trying to get at the origins of the universe – what happened in those very few first instants after the Big Bang," SPHEREx instrument scientist Phil Korngut of Caltech said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reigning theory that describes this is called inflation. As its name posits, it proposes that the universe underwent an enormous expansion, going from smaller than the size of an atom, expanding a trillion-trillion fold in just a tiny fraction of a second," Korngut said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at Nasa headquarters, said SPHEREx is going to search for "reverberations from the Big Bang – the fractions of a second after the Big Bang that echoed into the areas SPHEREx is going to directly observe."
  <br>
  <br>
  SPHEREx will take pictures in every direction around Earth, splitting the light from billions of cosmic sources such as stars and galaxies into their component wavelengths to determine their composition and distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within our galaxy, SPHEREx will search for reservoirs of water frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in large clouds of gas and dust that give rise to stars and planets.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will look for water and molecules including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide frozen on the surface of dust grains in molecular clouds, which are dense regions of gas and dust in interstellar space. Scientists believe that reservoirs of ice bound to dust grains in these clouds are where most of the universe's water forms and dwells. (Reuters)

 Former badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen suffered a shock first-round defeat to Chinese Taipei's Lin Chun-yi at the All England Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lin came out of top after a back-and-forth first game before Axelsen dominated the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane was not able to keep that form in the decider, however, as Lin reeled off six points in a row on the way to a 21-19, 13-21, 21-11 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I don't play my best, everyone can win against me," said Axelsen, the current world number four. "Today's opponent played a fantastic game, it was disappointing but that is how it is."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just tried to survive in the match," he added. "There is always a lot of pressure when I am here at the All England and every single day, and I got tense when my body was feeling bad and it affected my entire game."

<img alt="SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795503_1_20250313075135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming of US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad, officials said on a livestream of the launch countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when the next launch opportunity would be. The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and Nasa could try to launch again in the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams - stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner. The US space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than Nasa had planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and US Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral at 7.48 pm ET (2348 GMT) with a crew of two US astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station's other astronauts and have remained safe, according to Nasa. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," Williams said of her family. "We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun." The flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought - without offering evidence - to blame former President Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in Nasa's human spaceflight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but Nasa swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others - Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives in order to keep the ISS staffed with enough US astronauts for maintenance, according to Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. Nasa deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing built Starliner under a US$4.5 billion contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. Last year's mission had marked Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starliner's development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar Nasa contract worth at least US$4 billion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid produced a gritty display to reach the Champions League quarter-finals with a 4-2 win on penalties against rivals Atlético Madrid, following a 1-0 defeat after extra time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side outplayed the record 15-time champions at the Metropolitano stadium for much of the game, but Madrid have never been eliminated by Atlético in the competition and they battled hard after Conor Gallagher's first-minute opener to secure a 2-2 aggregate draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thibaut Courtois made several saves to thwart Julián Alvarez and Vinicius Junior blazed a penalty high and wide for Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez scored for Atlético in the shoot-out, but his effort was ruled out as he touched the ball twice because of a slip as he shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Llorente also missed for Atlético and Madrid's Antonio Rudiger struck the winner for the reigning champions, who will face Arsenal in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played an average match at home, and here, we came out as if it was already won and in the first move they scored a goal against us, and that messed us up a lot," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We went to penalties, by the end we were very tired – it was very noticeable, and thank God we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético played with caution in the first leg despite trailing, willing to take a single goal deficit back to the fiery Metropolitano stadium, where they believed they could really turn the heat up on their arch-rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid knocked Atlético out in the 2017 semi-finals in the final European game at the Vicente Calderon, with this the first time the derby has been played at Atlético's new home in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  After defeats by Madrid in the 2014 and 2016 finals, the latter on penalties, and elimination on every other occasion the teams have met in the competition, Atlético were desperate to change the narrative, but came up fractionally short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It hurts, I think we played a great match, but unfortunately we lacked a bit of luck," Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. "The truth is that one feels pain, it hurts a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético came flying out of the blocks and took the lead after just 27 seconds through Gallagher, levelling the tie on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul's low ball in from the right was not cut out by Raul Asencio and former Chelsea midfielder Gallagher lunged in to beat Courtois from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were content to sit deep and soak up pressure as Real Madrid pushed the ball around in their territory but were also ready to spring forward on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Courtois saved on three occasions from Alvarez, who had scored a brilliant goal in the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSV Eindhoven to complete an emphatic 9-3 aggregate win and set up a quarter-final clash against Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners demolished the Dutch champions 7-1 in the Netherlands last week, making the second leg at the Emirates a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who made seven changes from Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester United, were quickly out of the blocks, scoring in the sixth minute through Oleksandr Zinchenko.
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian veteran Ivan Perisic pulled PSV level on the night with a fine finish past the sprawling David Raya but midfielder Declan Rice headed Arsenal back in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSV, seeking to salvage pride after last week's humiliation, equalised with 20 minutes to go with a well-taken goal from Couhaib Driouech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who have never been crowned European champions, will play 15-time winners Real Madrid in the last eight after Carlo Ancelotti's side squeaked past Atletico Madrid on penalties following a 2-2 draw on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have met just twice previously, with Arsenal winning 1-0 on aggregate in the round of 16 in the 2005/06 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the club should enjoy the achievement of reaching back-to-back quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, when Arsene Wenger was manager of the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That tells you the difficulty of it," said the Spaniard. "We have to value that and recognise that it is very difficult to do it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've done it consistently and now we want to make the next step, which is going to be really difficult, but we are very capable of that," he added. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney will be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister on Friday morning, marking the final day of Justin Trudeau's more than nine years in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Governor General Mary Simon will preside over the swearing-in of Carney and his cabinet ministers Friday at 11 a.m., her office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former central banker who led the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada on Sunday. He will become Canada's 24th prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with long-time ally the United States under President Donald Trump and must hold a general election soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's new cabinet may be about half the size of Trudeau's executive, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cabinet is expected to have between 15 and 20 ministers, down from 37 currently including the prime minister, the report added, citing a source. (Reuters)

    Wall Street regains some ground after inflation report

<img alt="The shifts came after the consumer price index came in at a cooler than expected 2.8 percent for February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795496_1_20250313063349.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained some ground Wednesday helped by a rise in tech shares, as easing inflation assuaged some investor jitters about the world's biggest economy even as tariff worries lingered.
 <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index gained 0.5 percent to 5,599.30 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index surged 1.2 percent to 17,648.45.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 percent to 41,350.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shifts came after the consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, came in cooler than expected for February, the first full month that President Donald Trump was in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI was up 2.8 percent from a year ago, a touch lower than the 3.0 percent increase in January, according to Labor Department data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, "core" CPI was up 3.1 percent, also easing from before.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Karl Haeling of LBBW cautioned that the market rebound might have more to do with its "technical condition."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tech stocks got hit the most, so they're the ones that are bouncing the most," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US markets slumped early this week on fears that Trump's tariff policies might nudge the country's economy into a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But tech stocks picked up Wednesday with Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla logging notable gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the health of the US economy, subsequent data reports will likely be more meaningful when it comes to reflecting the effects of tariffs, Haeling added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's sweeping levies on steel and aluminium imports kicked in, marking the latest salvo in his broadening series of duties. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Wednesday said it has ordered tour group service providers to stop using restaurants linked to the gastroenteritis cluster involving dozens of teachers and students.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 students and teachers from three local secondary schools contracted gastroenteritis after dining at the same restaurants during an exchange trip to Shaoguan in Guangdong province.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bureau said preliminary investigations by mainland authorities showed no proof that the infections were caused by the arranged meals during the tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the investigations revealed that the outbreak was likely spread through daily contact between tour members or exposure to vomit.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a precaution, the bureau said it has also ordered all restaurants serving mainland study tours to temporarily stop serving raw and cold food.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau stressed that it has strict rules for meal safety and restaurant hygiene, and has been working closely with mainland officials to make sure all safety measures are followed.

    Canada announces additional tariffs on US goods

<img alt="Donald Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795475_1_20250312225143.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada on Wednesday announced additional tariffs on US$20.7 billion of US goods, retaliating against American levies on Canadian steel and aluminium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country’s finance minister Dominic Leblanc said the Canadian tariffs that come into force on Thursday will hit products that include computers and sports equipment, and were in response to President Donald Trump's 25 percent levy on Canadian aluminium and steel, which he called "unjustified and unreasonable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The escalation of the US-Canada trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepares to hand over power to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has said that Canada could impose non-tariff measures such as restricting oil exports to the US or levying export duties on minerals if American tariffs persist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists worry could cause a US recession and further lag on the global economy. (Agencies)

    'Companies Registry didn't breach privacy rules'

<img alt="The privacy watchdog says a total of 109,002 people may have been affected by a Companies Registry data leak in April. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795447_1_20250312193702.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it completed an investigation on last April's Companies Registry data leak, which affected nearly 110,000 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said there is insufficient evidence to show that the registry contravened Hong Kong’s data protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the probe after the registry discovered that people might be able to see extra personal details, such as ID card numbers, on its e-Search services if they tapped a certain key.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its report, the PCPD said the risk of “unauthorised or accidental access” to personal data of the affected people is “relatively low”, and that security measures were enhanced when the registry revamped its system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The PCPD noted that the additional personal data involved was not directly displayed on the search result pages. Searchers needed to take additional steps or procedures through tools such as web developer tools or [a] robotic search to access the relevant data,” the watchdog said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Furthermore, there is also no evidence to suggest that any additional personal data had been subject to improper access,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PCPD also noted that the registry had appointed an independent third party to review the relevant system.

<img alt="Ivan Lin hopes any price increment for 16 weeks worth of medication at public hospitals could be less than 10 percent, saying that would hurt members of the grassroots. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795440_1_20250312174458.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Wednesday welcomed the Hospital Authority’s new arrangement to cut the amount of medication distributed to patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  It also said any possible fee increase should be limited to 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting March 24, patients discharged from hospitals and those at specialist outpatient and general clinics will only get up to 24 weeks of medication each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Lin, a community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation (SoCO), noted that there are various reasons causing drug wastage.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, for instance, the long gap between each consultation meant patients didn't have the opportunity to talk to medical professionals if they suffer from unexpected side effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority also said it was reviewing the HK$15 charge for 16 weeks of medication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin hopes any increase would be below 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For grassroots patients, it’s very difficult to get a fee waiver,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And also for, perhaps, lower middle class patients, it’s an ongoing expense, and some of the specific drugs are more expensive, way more than HK$15. So it’s still financial pressure for the lower middle class.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin suggested expanding the fee waiver to cover Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 65 or above, rather than the current threshold of 75 or above, and to also include recipients of the Working Family Allowance Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also pointed out that the move to deliver medicine to patients' doorsteps since the service was implemented two years ago was "a good policy".
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the delivery fee of HK$65 poses a burden for grassroots patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, medical sector lawmaker Dr David Lam has suggested the authority should set up a multidisciplinary team comprising of public hospital doctors and pharmacists from community pharmacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pharmacist will give [the patients] a more detailed explanation on how to use the drugs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And there should also be an opportunity for the patient to go back and see the pharmacist after taking the new medicine...[when they] can ask the pharmacist about some worries [they] might have after taking that medicine."

 Hong Kong’s privacy watchdog said on Wednesday it launched a compliance check on Deliveroo to ensure the personal data of its customers and food couriers will not be leaked.
 <br>
  <br>
  The online food delivery firm on Monday announced it will quit the Hong Kong market, and sell some of its assets to rival foodpanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Privacy Commissioner’s Office said in a statement that Deliveroo’s closure may affect the personal data of its customers and riders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The compliance check has been commenced to ensure that the personal data concerned would not be misused, leaked or fall into the hands of fraudsters for fraudulent activities,” it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it will assist relevant merchants, including foodpanda, in handling, deleting or transferring the personal data in compliance with data protection laws.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they arrested three men who are suspected of stealing electronic devices from a Hong Kong Disneyland warehouse, and handling stolen goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources told RTHK the items included computer routers and TV remote controls stored in 18 boxes, and are worth about HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK understands that when officers went through surveillance footage, they found that a man had been to the warehouse earlier this month and he was driving a car registered under a warehouse staff member.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said police suspect that the electronic goods were taken away in several rounds, and later sold to a recycling company in Sham Shui Po.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the arrestees are aged between 23 and 28, and that two of them are connected to the recycling firm, while the remaining person works at the warehouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Hong Kong Disneyland said that none of the suspects are its employees, and it would fully cooperate with the police investigation.

 China will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three parties will exchange views on the Iranian nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu will chair the meeting in Beijing, which will be attended by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will follow a closed-door gathering of the United Nations Security Council in New York the same day regarding Iran's expansion of its stocks of uranium that are close to weapons-grade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During US President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on the country's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of the Path of Democracy, Ronny Tong, on Wednesday said people are confident about the One Country, Two Systems principle, despite Hong Kong facing a deficit and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tong made the remarks as his organisation unveiled the latest figures from its One Country, Two Systems Index – based on a local survey conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as well as data from international think tanks – which covered the last six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index found that people generally have a positive view on the SAR’s governance model, with a score of 6.14 out of 10, a 0.5 percent drop from the previous round.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think despite the rather negative news about the deficit, about a general economic situation, in particular the geopolitical situation, Hong Kong people are still rather confident that One Country, Two Systems would continue beyond 2047, and I think that itself is rather reassuring”, Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the index speaks volumes about how they look at One Country, Two Systems, that although there is a slight decline, they still think the future is good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The index also found that people’s sense of belonging to Hong Kong generally held steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 84 percent of respondents said they have no plans to emigrate, slightly down from last round’s 84.1 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenland's centre-right opposition Democrats have won a surprise victory in legislative elections, more than tripling their support to 29.9 percent of votes, official results showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nationalist Naleraq party, the most ardent pro-independence party which campaigned for the Arctic island to cut ties with Denmark as soon as possible, also saw its support more than double to 24.5 percent of votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two parties in the outgoing centre-left coalition government came in third and fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-autonomous Danish territory came under global spotlight this year after US President Donald Trump vowed to make Greenland part of the United States, saying it is vital to US security interests. The idea was rejected by most Greenlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast island, with a population of just 57,000, has been caught up in a geopolitical race for dominance in the Arctic, where melting ice caps are making its resources more accessible and opening new shipping routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People want change ... We want more business to finance our welfare," said Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Demokraatit's leader and a former minister of industry and minerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want independence tomorrow, we want a good foundation," Nielsen told reporters in Nuuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old will now hold talks with other parties to try and form a governing coalition. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday hinted that the city could double the funds raised for its initial public offering (IPO) market this year compared to that of last year, as optimism over the nation’s tech sector grows.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks in a speech, during which he noted that the SAR will ramp up efforts to woo leading firms to list here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to report that our IPO market has regained momentum. Last year, we raised some US$11 billion, ranking fourth globally," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we are benefiting from optimism in the tech sector, and the continued support from the central authorities in encouraging leading mainland companies to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We are expecting to raise some US$17 to $20 billion this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Chan noted that Hong Kong is on track to become a leading global technological and innovation centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said while the city's innovation and technology sectors are growing, the transition to become a leading tech hub will not be complete without the development of the Northern Metropolis, which will link the SAR with the "innovation powerhouse" that is the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster has been ranked second globally in innovation by the World Intellectual Property Organization for each of the past five years," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Northern Metropolis will support Hong Kong's synergistic development with our sister cities in the GBA. Bordering Shenzhen and spanning nearly one third of the total landmass of Hong Kong, it comprises a 300-hectare I&T cluster that will be home to many strategic tech enterprises," he added.

 The government is optimistic about the number of people who will stay under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, labour chief Chris Sun said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 people have been granted visas of up to three years under the scheme since its launch at the end of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the government is currently handling visa-renewal requests by more than 300 people who are here under the talent scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that about 10,000 visas are going to expire by the middle of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will analyse the situation by then." Sun said. "We think things will be more accurate and provide a much clearer picture regarding the situation about the talent's visa renewal, jobs and contributions to Hong Kong. There will be more data. But even with such small number of renewals at the moment, we are still satisfied with how things are going,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme allows successful applicants to stay in the SAR without proof of employment during their first visa granted under the talent scheme.

  For renewals, top talents also don't need to show a work contract, although they have to demonstrate their contributions to the city, such as by showing their income or other forms of economic benefits that their work brought.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported marginal full-year profit growth as airfares fell amid intense competition at a time when Asia's airlines are continuing to get back to pre-pandemic seat capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city’s flagship airline posted a one percent rise in its group net profit of HK$9.89 billion for the year ended December 31, supported by elevated cargo demand, more passengers, lower fuel prices and cost efficiencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the Hong Kong-listed airline jumped almost four percent to their highest since May 2019 just after the results were announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay Pacific's full-service airline, however, saw its annual yield, a proxy for airfares, fall 12 percent, while yields at the group's fully owned low-cost carrier HK Express fell 23 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Express reported a full-year loss of HK$400 million compared to a profit of HK$433 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay attributed the drops at HK Express to intense competition on regional routes pushing airfares down and industry-wide issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power its Airbus A320neo planes, which grounded some aircraft in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A path to sustained profitability can be expected as [HK Express] continues to grow and increase its efficiencies," Cathay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline's cargo yields, meanwhile, rose three percent year on year and the airline carried 11 percent more cargo tonnage, although Cathay warned that developing global trade conflicts could pose challenges to its freight business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the global geopolitical situation, we are cautiously monitoring any short-term impacts on air cargo demand," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer,  Lavinia Lau, noted that shifts in global trade policies, such as de minimis changes, have increased uncertainties over the cargo market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that the airline has contingency plans to handle unexpected changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always built in flexibility in our business, meaning that if we see demand from a certain country or region having changes, we can always shift our network and flights to other parts of the world," she said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Measures to cut construction costs to come this year'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development secretary Bernadette Linn said reviewing construction standards and centralising procurement of materials are among concrete measures that the government will take to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her bureau had conducted research last year on why construction costs are high by comparing projects here with those in other major cities around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Linn said it's been quite some time since officials had taken a look at local construction standards, such as those on design and use of materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, our standards tended to be closer to those in the UK or the European Union. But  construction industries in many places in the world now have their own development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can take reference from more places, including the mainland of course, and the advantage of this is that we can then turn them into our own standards and possibly open up more markets and sources [of materials] for ourselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn stressed that suppressing local wages is not a way to lower costs, describing it as a hot potato social issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that by this year, officials will start on the central procurement of certain construction materials, as well as cutting red tape for project approvals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government uses a similar bunch of construction materials for a project, or a series of projects, such as steel. So we can centralise the procurement and buy in bulk at cheaper prices," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for streamlining the project approval process, we don't give empty promises, we'll look to come up with concrete measures to streamline the administrative process in the coming months."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the time-saving move for administrative procedures comes after legal changes in 2023 to compress the statutory time needed for project approvals.

    Social workers board 'to review applications by law'

 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Wednesday he believes the Social Workers Registration Board will review any renewal application as required by law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was speaking a day after social worker Jackie Chen was convicted of rioting during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the board’s website, Chen’s registration as a social worker expired last month and that her renewal application is being considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Social Workers Registration Ordinance states clearly that if certain designated offences are committed, the Social Workers Registration Board will fulfill its duties. I firmly believe the board will handle renewal applications in accordance with the law and the regulations, including Chen’s request,” Sun said after attending a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ordinance states that the board may refuse to register people who committed a crime that “may bring the profession of social worker into disrepute and is punishable with imprisonment” as a social worker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Social workers who commit more serious offences, including murder, rape, as well as any offence endangering national security will be permanently removed from the registration list.

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

<img alt="Darius Garland scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795390_1_20250312121604.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland scored 30 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a double-digit comeback to bag their 15th straight victory with a 109-104 defeat of the Brooklyn Nets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland looked to be heading for a shock loss after lowly Brooklyn raced into an 18-point lead in the third quarter against a Cavs line-up missing the rested Donovan Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Garland produced an explosive late burst of scoring to haul Cleveland back into the contest and extend the Cavaliers' lead at the top of the Eastern Conference to 55-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen of Garland's points came in the fourth quarter after the Cavs had cut the Nets lead to eight points at the end of the third thanks to a remarkable 49-foot three-pointer from Craig Porter Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porter's buzzer-beating heave from half-court left Cleveland trailing 86-78, and Garland then took over with a dazzling fourth-quarter display to see the Cavs home to the delight of the Rocket Arena crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was the fifth time this season Cleveland have overturned a deficit of 15 points or more to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  A weary Garland admitted though he would have preferred an easier path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sick and tired of comebacks," Garland joked after the win. "But we play hard for 48 minutes. We weren't shooting the ball the best so our defense took a stand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This team is a really good unit – we stick together through the good times and the bad times," he added. "We were all locked in through the fourth quarter – that's when we put our hard hats on and go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson saluted Garland's game-winning late charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the clutch player of the year," Atkinson said. "He just does it for us in the fourth quarter – he's done it for us all year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland received scoring support from Jarrett Allen, who had 13 rebounds and three blocks as well as scoring 23 points, and Evan Mobley who added 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The loss was hard on Brooklyn, who went into the game fresh from Monday's upset win over the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas led Brooklyn's scoring with 27 points while Cameron Johnson added 17 as the Nets fell to 22-43 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm proud of the guys because the first half was impressive," Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. "I just wish we would have been rewarded with a win." (AFP)
