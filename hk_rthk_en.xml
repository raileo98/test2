<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation in February fell at the quickest pace since January 2024, while producer price deflation persisted, as seasonal demand faded while households are still cautious about spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index edged down 0.7 percent last month from a year earlier, reversing January's 0.5 percent increase, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first contraction in the index since January 2024, and worse than a 0.5 percent slide estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.2 percent month-on-month, against a 0.7 percent rise in January and below a predicted 0.1 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index fell 2.2 percent on year in February, improving from a 2.3 percent slide in January, but missing the forecast 2.1 percent decline. (Reuters)

 A man who climbed Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower at London's Palace of Westminster waving a Palestinian flag early on Saturday has come down after 16 hours, according to Sky News.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported he shouted "free Palestine".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency crews had gone up in a crane to negotiate with the man, and he came down after earlier telling negotiators he would come down "on his own terms", according to the Sky News report.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police earlier said they were alerted to the incident at Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) at 0724 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers are at the scene working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. They are being assisted by the London Fire Brigade and the London Ambulance Service," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services closed Westminster Bridge on Saturday morning in response to the incident, and parliamentary tours were also cancelled, according to Sky News. (Reuters)

<img alt="Liverpool's Egyptian striker #11 Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring the team's third goal from the penalty spot. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794946_1_20250309085129.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool needed two Mohamed Salah penalties to beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 3-1 on Saturday, while Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool stretched their lead at the top to a massive 16 points, despite a lethargic first 45 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from a 1-0 Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool boss Arne Slot made just three changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Dutchman was forced into making three half-time alterations to kickstart the champions-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The manager was like going for us - but that's something you need sometimes. Because first half, the game was sloppy," said Salah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton have taken just nine points from 28 games all season, but stunned Anfield when Will Smallbone fired the visitors in front in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alisson Becker was Liverpool's hero at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday but the Brazilian and Virgil van Dijk got in each other's way to allow Smallbone to roll into an unguarded net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot turned to Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister and Andy Robertson at the break, and the changes had the desired effect with two goals in three minutes before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darwin Nunez levelled with a sharp near-post finish from Luis Diaz's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nunez was then upended inside the area and Salah converted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian slotted home a second penalty two minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 32 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have two games in hand on the leaders, the first of which comes away to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it appears a matter of when not if Liverpool will clinch just their second league title in 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest pulled four points clear of City in third thanks to Callum Hudson-Odoi's late winner at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Chelsea winger fired past Ederson on 83 minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White's pass to spark jubilant scenes of celebration as Forest beat the English champions for the first time since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time European champions, Forest have not experienced the continent's top competition since 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are closing in on the Champions League with a top-five finish almost certain to be enough thanks to the strong performance of English teams in Europe this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not here to joke", Hudson-Odoi posted on social media. "Goal, MOTM (man-of-the-match), three points!"
  <br>
  <br>
  City remain fourth and are looking over their shoulders after a ninth league defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men are likely to be overtaken by Chelsea, when they host struggling Leicester on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa closed to within two points of the top four as Ollie Watkins came back to haunt Brentford once more in a 1-0 win in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken let the England striker's effort fly through his legs on 49 minutes as Watkins struck for the sixth time in six games against his former club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton boosted their own Champions League hopes courtesy of Joao Pedro's 98th-minute penalty to beat Fulham 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raul Jimenez's strike opened the scoring for Fulham, but Jean Paul van Hecke levelled before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedro's spot-kick lifts the Seagulls to sixth and within one point of City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace shrugged off the loss of top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta to a serious ear injury to beat Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Ismaila Sarr's winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles have won nine of their last 11 games in all competitions and climb to 11th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves edged six points clear of the relegation zone after a 1-1 draw against Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marshall Munetsi cancelled out Jack Harrison's opener for the visitors at Molineux as Everton extended their unbeaten league run to eight games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to give his side a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and keep them on track for a top-four finish and prized place in next year's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winger picked up a glorious diagonal pass from Morgan Gibbs-White before running into the box and beating City goalkeeper Ederson at his near post from a tight angle in the 83rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a game of few chances, Pep Guardiola's City team came closest when Nico Gonzalez's long-range shot scraped the outside of the post, while Hudson-Odoi saw a curled effort pushed onto the post by Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result kept this season's surprise team Forest third on 51 points, with City in fourth place on 47. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said Hong Kong should take the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to a new level, and strive for better development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Zheng said President Xi Jinping made the remarks when meeting Jiangsu deputies, asking them to promote scientific and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said the remarks were also meaningful for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong must focus on reform and innovation and walk on the new path of developing new quality productive forces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong should consolidate and enhance its status as the so-called “three centres”, and as an international hub for tertiary education, and innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should safeguard national security, pursue economic growth and advance development, as pointed out by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng added that Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, and speed up the process of advancing to prosperity.

    Pope doing physiotherapy in hospital after quiet night

<img alt="Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin reads aloud a message on the pope's behalf during a mass in St Peter's Basilica on Saturday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794926_1_20250308200342.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis was doing physiotherapy on Saturday after passing a quiet night, the Vatican said, as the 88-year-old head of the global Catholic Church battles pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis "is going on with treatment and physiotherapy this morning", the Vatican said, having earlier issued a briefing which simply said his night had been "calm."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff, who had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man, has been in a special papal suite at Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentine has suffered several respiratory crises since his admission, most recently on Monday, but for several days now the Vatican has described his condition as "stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  He is still in a "complex clinical condition," so "the prognosis remains guarded," it said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Francis released an audio message – the first time the world had heard his voice since he went into hospital – in which he thanked those praying for his recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff sounded weak and breathless despite marking three weeks of treatment at the Gemelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the Square. I accompany you from here," said Francis, taking laboured breaths every couple of words.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope on Friday mostly rested and prayed, including spending around 20 minutes in the little chapel inside the hospital's papal suite, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continues to switch between an oxygen mask at night and a cannula – a plastic tube tucking into the nostrils – delivering high-flow oxygen during the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been doing bits of work when possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin read aloud a message on the pope's behalf during a mass in St Peter's Basilica.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had worked on the message from hospital just a few days ago, on March 5, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid for greater transparency, the Vatican has been publishing an update on how the pope slept every morning, followed by a more detailed medical bulletin each evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, it said that "in view of the stability of the clinical picture," there would be no medical bulletin on Friday evening. The next is due later Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  During previous hospitalisations, the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics appeared on the Gemelli balcony for his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he has missed the last three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican press office said on Saturday that it was "quite probable" the Angelus would be delivered this Sunday "in the same way" as in previous weeks, when it was published as a letter released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has suffered a series of health issues in recent years, from colon surgery in 2021 to a hernia operation in 2023, but this is the longest and most serious hospitalisation of his papacy. (AFP)

    Muslim nations adopt Arab idea over Trump's Gaza plan

<img alt="The OIC's decision came at an emergency meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794923_1_20250308192050.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation formally adopted early on Saturday an Arab League counter-proposal to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over Gaza and displace its residents, calling on the international community to support the regional initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision by the 57-member grouping came at an emergency meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, three days after the Arab League ratified the plan at a summit in Cairo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian-crafted alternative to Trump's widely condemned takeover plan proposes to rebuild the Gaza Strip under the future administration of the Palestinian Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The OIC "adopts the plan... on the early recovery and reconstruction of Gaza," it said in a communique.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body, which represents the Muslim world, urged "the international community and international and regional funding institutions to swiftly provide the necessary support for the plan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump triggered global outrage when he suggested the US "take over" Gaza and turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East," while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the OIC endorsement and said he now hoped to gain support from the wider international community, including the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others," Abdelatty said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what we will seek, and we have contact with all parties, including the American party."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Egyptian proposal – which does not outline a role for Hamas, which controls Gaza – has already been rejected by both the US and Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan "does not meet the expectations" of Washington, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, however, gave a more positive reaction, calling it a "good-faith first step from the Egyptians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan has united Arab countries in opposition, and Rabha Seif Allam, of the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, said Egypt was seeking "broad support" for its proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an attempt to build a broad coalition that refuses the displacement" of Palestinians from Gaza, she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 It’s a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament in Fanling going into the final round on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three players finished the second round on Saturday on eleven-under-par and hold a three-stroke lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Day one leader Paul Casey of England remains on top. Joining him is Sergio Garcia of Spain and Peter Uihlein of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American made a huge charge for the lead, hitting an eagle and eight birdies, but he also had four bogeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big names, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson was three shots off the lead, alongside Sebastian Muñoz of Columbia and Chilean Mito Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the current US Open champion, is tied in 7th place with seven others, including 2010 US Open champion Graeme McDowell and two-time major winner Jon Rahm of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Abraham Ancer put in a much better performance, shooting five-under-par on the day and is now tied in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the team competition, Torque G-C are on top with a three-stroke lead.

    S Korea's impeached President Yoon released

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was released from detention on Saturday after a court voided his arrest on procedural grounds – but he remains under investigation over his declaration of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president, who was detained in a dawn raid in January on insurrection charges over his December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule, walked out of the detention centre smiling, before bowing deeply before a small crowd of cheering supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I bow my head in gratitude to the people of this nation," Yoon said in a statement released through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, a court had cancelled his arrest warrant on technical and legal grounds – a decision that prosecutors probing Yoon said in a statement on Saturday was "unjust."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was freed after the prosecutors waived their right to appeal the court verdict, which was specifically about technical details of his detention on criminal charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also faces a separate Constitutional Court ruling on whether to uphold his impeachment and formally strip him from office, with the judges' decision expected any day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said that "given the Constitutional Court's ruling and related considerations, the Prosecutor General has instructed the team to actively present its arguments before the trial court instead" of appealing Yoon's release from detention.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea must hold a fresh presidential election within 60 days if Yoon is removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The criminal case against him will continue even if he is formally stripped of office. (AFP)

 Two former world champions, Shaun Murphy of England and Neil Robertson of Australia, put on a show for fans at the Kai Tak Arena on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Robertson narrowly edged out Murphy in the deciding frame to move into the final of the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian was down 5-3 at one point but fought back, finishing the final frame with his third century break of the match to win the best-of-eleven match 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other final spot will be decided later on Saturday evening, when world number one Judd Trump takes on fellow Englishman Stuart Bingham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two have previously met 37 times, with Trump winning on 26 occasions.

<img alt="Three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic has become the first player ever to score more than 30 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794896_1_20250308153519.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers staged a dramatic late rally to stretch their unbeaten streak to 13 games with a nail-biting 118-117 over the lowly Charlotte Hornets in the NBA on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte, buoyed by a stellar 46-point display from Miles Bridges, looked ready to score a massive upset after opening up a nine-point lead with just over five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who this week became the first team to punch their ticket to the postseason, rallied superbly to claw their way back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sensational Evan Mobley three-pointer tied it for the Cavs at 106-106 with just over two minutes remaining, before Donovan Mitchell put the Cavs into a winning position with six straight free throws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 24 points while Darius Garland finished with 20 and Mobley 19 as the Cavs improved to 53-10. Cleveland lead the East by eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bridges almost single-handedly inspired Charlotte to what would have been a remarkable upset. Only two other Hornets players finished with double figures as Charlotte fell to 14-48 to remain one place off the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said his team's determination to dig out victory augured well for the looming playoff campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirteen in a row – I think yes, we're in a good groove," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to scratch and claw these last couple of games, which is great for playoff prep – playing in some tight games and having to execute at the end of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our group's in a really good place. It did feel like our energy was a little bit down, but when our energy's high, it's really tough to beat us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder extended their lead at the top of the standings after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 107-89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault could afford to rest Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Williams and Cason Wallace, but they were still too strong for an outgunned Blazers lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Wiggins led the Oklahoma City scoring with 30 points, while Jaylin Williams posted his first career triple-double with 11 rebounds, 11 assists and 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  OKC improved to 52-11 and lead the West by 11 games from the second-placed Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Denver, Nikola Jokic made history en route to equalling his career-high tally of triple-doubles for a season as the Nuggets downed the Phoenix Suns 149-141 in an overtime thriller.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic finished with 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists to complete his 29th triple of the season. It marked the first time ever a player has scored more than 30 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns, desperately needing a victory as they chase a place in the play-in tournament, rallied back brilliantly from 21 points down in the third quarter to tie it up when Kevin Durant drained a three-pointer on the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jokic took over in overtime to close out a victory that leaves the Nuggets third in the West on 41-22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Memphis Grizzlies halted their four-game skid with a 122-111 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, who were without the injured Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant sparked the Grizzlies with 31 points, while Desmond Bane added 27 points, 16 rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies are fourth in the West with a 39-24 record, while Dallas fell to 32-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Miami, the Minnesota Timberwolves' balanced offense was enough to secure a 106-104 victory over the Heat, with seven T'Wolves players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairwoman of Gree Electrics on Saturday said private enterprises need continuous innovation and technological investment to thrive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dong Mingzhu, who's also a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said the country has long supported private enterprises through various forms of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Dong said her company's trade-in policy helps consumers gain a better understanding of household appliances and improves safety awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang Wenbo, NPC deputy and chairman of SANY Heavy Industry, which earlier announced plans to list in Hong Kong, said the timing is favourable given the current capital market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang added that he believes listing in the SAR will speed up his company's international development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials on Saturday said they will learn from the spirit of "Two Sessions" and stressed the importance of unity in advancing the SAR's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said her team was inspired by the speech of Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung stressed the civil service's role in implementing One Country, Two Systems, highlighting the importance of using technology in government operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said the city is making use of its advantages under One Country, Two Systems to attract medical professionals and help Chinese medicine reach international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak said she will work with care teams and district councillors to promote the spirit of Two Sessions at grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  On her Facebook page, cultural, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said Premier Li Qiang's work report has provided important direction for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law outlined plans to implement the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, enhance cultural exchanges and organise major sporting events, including the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn, for her part, said her bureau will continue to push forward the development of the Northern Metropolis and enhance cooperation with the Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Saturday said Hong Kong and the mainland should work together to tackle cross-border scams, after six more SAR residents were released from scam farms in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s vice minister of public security Xu Ganlu said the joint operation of China and Thailand achieved success in rescuing victims from Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope people trapped in scam farms can return to their families as soon as possible. The Chinese public security organs will work closely with foreign police to rescue more victims,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Luo Zhaohui, said phone scams are outrageous, and Hong Kong should join hands with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our cooperation with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and through diplomatic and public security efforts, we have seen progress in cooperation with Myanmar and Thailand,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It must be challenging to crack down on any kind of scams… Hong Kong is also facing this problem, so it is necessary for the SAR to work with the mainland.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested six people for allegedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Mong Kok last August.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five women and a man, aged 15 to 22, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, after the teenage girl made a report to the police on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the girl was allegedly slapped and bullied by around 10 teenage boys and girls, at a rear staircase of a shopping mall in Mong Kok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they had argued over “an attitude problem and trivial matters.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also believe that one of the attackers had filmed a video of the assault, but officers are investigating why the video was posted to the internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The arrestees are being detained for further enquiries, and police said they have information about other alleged attackers. Some of the attackers allegedly have a triad background.

    Ex-Cyclone Alfred sparks flood warnings in Australia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Cyclone Alfred stalled off the rain- and wind-lashed coast of eastern Australia on Saturday, threatening to unleash floods after blacking out more than a quarter of a million homes and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former tropical cyclone – now downgraded to a tropical depression – has battered the coastline with gale-force winds that toppled trees, brought down power lines, and damaged buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was still creating heavy rainfall, swelling rivers in parts of a 400-kilometre stretch of the coast straddling southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales, government forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Utility companies said 295,000 properties in southeast Queensland and another 42,600 in New South Wales were without power, warning that floods could hamper repairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the weather system "stalled and began weakening," the bureau of meteorology warned that intense rain and damaging wind gusts were a risk throughout the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rivers are already starting to respond to the heavy rainfall, with many Minor to Major Flood Warnings current," the bureau said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man was missing after his four-wheel drive pick-up truck was swept off a bridge into a rain-engorged river the previous day in northern New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  He clambered out of the vehicle and tried in vain to cling to a tree branch in the river.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The man was swept from the tree and seen to go beneath the water where he has not been sighted since," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flooded roads and high winds made it too dangerous to send in crews or helicopters to search for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there were "grave concerns" for the man.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it has been downgraded, very serious risks remain so it is important that people do not take this downgrading as a reason for complacency," Albanese told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its impact will be serious and will intensify over coming hours and indeed over coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation orders have been issued for 16,200 people in New South Wales, where 30 flood rescues have been carried out over the past 24 hours, emergency services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference the emergency was not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not over for the following reasons: The rivers are full. The rain is continuing and is expected to keep falling in the days ahead. And wind conditions are very high and extreme," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Lismore – a northern New South Wales city hit by deadly floods in 2022 and a focus of concern in the past few days – the Wilsons River was no longer expected to spill over a 10.6-metre levee protecting inhabitants, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paramedic Ginny Burke, 30, said she was at work when the wind uprooted a large gum tree that smashed through the house she is renting in Elanora on the Gold Coast in Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burke said she returned to her crushed home, where her sister recounted that she had heard the tree fall on Friday evening but described the calamity as "really unexciting."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What can you do?" the paramedic asked. "It's just stuff. Everyone's safe." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung on Saturday said the government will think about how to enforce the national security law better.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came after the Court of Final Appeal earlier overturned the convictions of three members of the now-disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, for refusing to hand information over to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Cheung said the national security law is considered as a relatively new piece of legislation as this year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there was no precedent for law enforcement agencies to follow when carrying out the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Cheung said the government will take the court’s view into account and think about how to improve the enforcement of the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ll carefully study the judgement handed down by the Court of Final Appeal. We will see how the judgement can further improve the law enforcement mechanism of the national security in Hong Kong,” Cheung said to reporters after attending the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But I will say the judgement and the case law will contribute significantly to the development of jurisprudence of the national security law in Hong Kong,” he added.

    Catholics across China praying for Pope's recovery

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland Catholic bishop attending the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing on Saturday expressed hope for the speedy recovery of Pope Francis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, has been hospitalised for three weeks with pneumonia in both lungs. The Vatican on Friday said his condition remained "stable" after the pope delivered a weak and breathless audio message thanking well-wishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Fang, vice-president of the Bishops' Conference of Catholic Church in China and a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Catholics across the nation are praying for the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Great Hall of the People, Fang also noted he's been advocating for diplomatic relations between Beijing and the Holy See, though there's no timeline for when that would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican. We have repeatedly advocated for this at various meetings and occasions with leadership, and are actively working toward early diplomatic relations," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, the Vatican and China extended a deal over the appointments of Catholic bishops by another four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement was reached in 2018 and was renewed in 2020 and 2022, giving both sides the power to nominate candidates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country’s most senior judge has promised to take steps to counter unlawful sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jun, president of the Supreme People’s Court, also said on Saturday that authorities would equally protect the rights of state-owned, private, and foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will promote the development of a law-based economy and a credit economy, while strengthening foreign-related legal development and firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his report, Zhang noted courts at all levels, across the country over the past year have cracked down on crimes that seriously endanger social order, including penalising offences involving cross-border telecom scams in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have resolutely safeguarded national security and handed down punishment on offences such as subversion, separatism, and espionage, the top judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ying Yong, the country’s top prosecutor, vowed to safeguard national security and social stability in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said authorities would follow the principle that everyone is equal before the law, and handle every case with efficiency.

 Chief Executive John Lee praised the contribution of women to society and pledged that the government is committed to promoting women's rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks on Saturday at a reception held at government headquarters, celebrating March 8 - the International Women's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, women are the backbone of our society.  They include leaders, innovators, caregivers, change-makers and more. From boardrooms to classrooms, from workspace to marketplace, the women of Hong Kong continue to break barriers and inspire future generations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is dedicated to promoting gender equality and empowering women in every facet of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted since taking over office, he had established the Women Empowerment Fund and organised the first Family and Women Development Summit in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will work together with the Women's Commission to foster an inclusive, opportunity-filled Hong Kong for all women.

    New scheme aims to remove poorly managed buildings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's hope that a new scheme can help eliminate poorly managed, so-called "three-nil buildings" - which are blocks that lack owners’ corporations, property management services, or resident organizations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak says the joint building management scheme will involve the same property management company handling aged building clusters in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will act as a middleman to link property owners with professionals from NGOs who can advise them on finding the right management company.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will commence a one-year test in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, and Tsuen Wan later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Mak noted the project will help take care of aged buildings in the relevant areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Aside from the three-nil buildings, there are some aging, single-block buildings in old districts that only have 10 to 20 households. Even if they manage to form an owners' corporation, hiring a management company can be expensive as the cost can be too high for just a few units to share. So, in most cases they just choose not to set one up,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mak said the government has set aside HK$7 million for the project, with care teams and community NGOs helping to promote it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that consultations have started in District Councils across the four districts and hoped that the project can commence by mid-year.

<img alt="Gene Hackman poses during the 60th annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. January 19, 2003. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794873_1_20250308114632.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife died of natural causes about a week apart, a medical examiner said on Friday, ending more than a week of mystery surrounding the death of one of Hollywood's most beloved stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of "The French Connection" star and his wife were found on February 26 in their home in New Mexico after emergency services were called to their property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, aged 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor," Heather Jarrell, the chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, aged 65 years, is hantavirus, pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither body showed any sign of trauma, nor any indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, which had been an initial suggestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hantavirus presents as a flu-like disease, with symptoms including fever, muscle aches, cough, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea that can progress to shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure, Jarrell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This occurs after a one- to eight-week exposure to excrement from a particular mouse species that carries hantavirus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrell said data from Hackman's pacemaker showed its last activity over a week before his body was found when maintenance workers were unable to access the couple's sprawling Santa Fe property.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hagman probably died around February 18. Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Miss Hackman passed away first, with February 11 being the last time that she was going to be alive," said Jarrell.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Betsy Hackman's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gene Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses nearby, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dog was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to autopsies, the investigation had focused on piecing together a timeline of the couple's last days, which detectives said had been complicated by their low profile and their preference for privacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is perhaps best known as vulgar New York cop Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in the 1971 crime thriller "The French Connection", for which he won an Oscar for best actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won another golden statuette two decades later for best supporting actor for his portrayal of the brutal small-town sheriff "Little Bill" Daggett in the 1992 western "Unforgiven." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation’s top legislators on Saturday pledged to formulate and amend a slew of laws in the coming year, including one on backing private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments, at or above the county level, to provide regular progress reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Leji, who chairs the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), told a plenary meeting in Beijing that the law will be hammered out in parliament, as he outlined targets for the lawmaking body.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are also keenly aware that there are a number of gaps and shortcomings in our work,” said Zhao.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to further improve the quality of legislative work, and we should also step up our work in the emerging areas, and also fill in the short links in foreign-related legislation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting back this past year, the senior state leader said the NPC had strengthened the implementation of the Constitution, advanced a number of legislation, and enhanced foreign outreach.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Saturday announced that it will impose additional tariffs on some products imported from Canada based on the ruling of an anti-discrimination probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Effective from March 20, an additional 100-percent tariff will be imposed on imported rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas originating from Canada, while aquatic products and pork will be subject to an additional 25-percent tariff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes after the central government's anti-discrimination probe, which found that Canada's restrictive measures against some Chinese products have disrupted normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. (Xinhua)

    'HK can't stop residential and industrial land sale'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said Hong Kong is not in a position to stop selling residential and industrial land.
 <br>
  <br>
  In this year’s Budget, the government stated it wouldn't sell commercial sites in the coming year in light of the high office vacancy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pushed back against opinions saying that all land sales should be put on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Firstly, Hong Kong is eager to grow various industries. We want to make as much industrial land available for development as possible, so there’s no room to hold back. That goes against our strategy," she told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also won’t stop selling residential land. We have a solid plan in place, with a 10-year projection for how much land we need for public and private housing. This plan has been in play for several years, and we allocate based on this estimate every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Budget also proposed converting some commercial land into residential use, with locations including Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Tung Chung, Shek Mun, and Kowloon East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government will take various factors into consideration before making a decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If the area is not designated as a core business area, I think there's more room to include more residential elements in it. We’ll also look at the office vacancy rates. Additionally, are there newly built commercial buildings? If there are, it suggests the supply is sufficient, so we have room for adjustment,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if the government is considering installment payments to encourage developers to bid for land, the development minister said they have an open mind toward large-scale land deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn pointed out that each pilot zone in the Northern Metropolis could involve HK$10 billion to HK$20 billion in investment, adding that the administration will seek opinions from developers in the market sentiment survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tending process for the three pilot zones, located in Hung Shui Kiu Ha Tsuen, Fanling North, and San Tin Technopole, will begin tendering work from second half of the year.

    Top-seeded Zverev crashes out in Indian Wells opener

<img alt="German Alexander Zverev in-between points during his match against Tallon Griekspoor. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794847_1_20250308081214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two and top seed Alexander Zverev was sent crashing out of Indian Wells on Friday as he was beaten 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, heading the field of the prestigious ATP Masters event with world number one Jannik Sinner serving a three-month drugs ban, is the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opener since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat in a tension-packed Stadium Court thriller continues a lackluster run for Zverev since he fell to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then the German had made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev saved five match points in a tension-packed 12th game of the third set, finally converting his fifth break point of the game to force the tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Griekspoor sealed it on his first chance in the decider, and the Dutch player was delighted to get it over the line against a player who beat him four times last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor next faces France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the 29th seed who was leading 6-4 when Hungrian Fabien Marozsan retired from their second-round match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev said the Italian's enforced absence had at first had him harbouring ideas of climbing to the top. But they are fading with his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible," said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opening match since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments," Zverev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten people died and hundreds were evacuated in the Argentine port city of Bahia Blanca on Friday as torrential rains flooded homes and hospitals, destroyed roads and forced authorities to cut the power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eight hours of nonstop rain left the city of 350,000 people largely under water, and forced authorities to evacuate the Jose Penna hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Television images showed medical personnel evacuating babies from the hospital's neonatal unit, and the army was deployed to assist in rescue efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,000 people were evacuated to safety in the city about 600 kilometers south of the capital Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Municipal officials said ten people were confirmed to have died, but the toll could still rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city received more than 400 millimeters of rain in just hours - equivalent to what it normally gets in a year, "something unprecedented," according to Javier Alonso, security minister for the Buenos Aires province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest storm in Bahia Blanca was in 1930, with 175 millimeters. This is almost three times bigger," said Alonso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bahia Blanca's airport was closed until further notice, and officials cut off part of the power supply to reduce the risk of electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The provincial government said it was sending helicopters, canoes, ambulances and trucks bearing food, water and equipment to the stricken city.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard was assisting in the rescue with inflatable boats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was raining, and suddenly we saw the street was flooded. About a meter-and-a-half of water came into my house," Flavia Viera Romero, who rescued her children from the deluge, told the LN+ channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city remains on alert from the meteorological service for new storms. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday after a roller-coaster session following mixed labor market data, concluding a losing week on a positive note.
 <br>
  <br>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said investors were reassured by a midday appearance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who described the central bank is in no hurry to shift course on monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When Powell came out with a calm and reassuring tone, it gave the market an excuse to rally," O'Hare said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,770, up 0.6 percent for the day but down 3.1 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 percent at 42,801, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7 percent to 18,196.
  <br>
  <br>
  US jobs data for February showed the country's economy added 151,000 jobs last month, up from January's revised 125,000 figure, but fewer than analysts estimates as unemployment ticked higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts described the report as unspectacular but good enough to suggest the labor market is not weakening precipitously.
  <br>
  <br>
  But O'Hare said investors are readjusting their views of the coming period in light of other disappointing economic reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is rethinking its growth outlook," he said. "Some of that is the tariffs. Some of that is the work around 'Doge'. Some of it is in the data itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Costco slumped 6.1 percent following disappointing earnings that sparked unease about the wholesaler's exposure to tariffs. Walmart also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Broadcom surged 8.6 percent after strong results boosted enthusiasm about the company's work in artificial intelligence. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Customs intensified enforcement at the international airport and uncovered multiple cases of illicit cigarette smuggling involving air passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Customs raided a suspected storage facility in Yuen Long, seizing approximately 6.7 million illicit cigarettes and 570,000 alternative smoked products, valued at an estimated HK$33 million, with a duty potential of HK$22 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Friday, Customs arrested a 36-year-old man outside a hotel in Tin Shui Wai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was found in possession of 90,000 illicit cigarettes and 110,000 alternative smoking products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations revealed that the syndicate used air passengers to smuggle these items, which were stored in hotel rooms for further distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who claimed to be unemployed, faces charges and will appear in Tuen Mun Magistrate's Courts on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seized alternative smoking products will be handed over to the Department of Health for further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past two weeks, Customs intercepted 20 illicit cigarette smuggling cases at the airport, arresting 13 men and eight women.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 600,000 illicit cigarettes and 460,000 alternative smoking products were seized, with an estimated market value of HK$4 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  A follow-up operation at a Yuen Long logistics warehouse led to the arrest of a 44-year-old driver after the discovery of 6 million illicit cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was released on bail pending further investigation.

Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794817_1_20250307225043.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump on Friday threatened new sanctions and tariffs on Russia over its bombardments of Ukraine, after previously suspending US aid to Kyiv in a stated bid to encourage diplomacy.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat comes after Russia launched major drone and missile attacks on Friday on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days earlier, the Trump administration suspended US military aid deliveries and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine after a dispute with President Volodymyr Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Vice President JD Vance, on February 28, berated Zelensky in a televised meeting at the White House, accusing him of ingratitude for billions of dollars in US weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has since faced harsh criticism from allies and domestic opponents who say he has sided with Russia, which attacked Ukraine in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States voted with Russia and against its European allies on United Nations resolutions that called for ending the war without stressing Ukraine's territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Trump spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin in an initial step toward resuming normal relations and undoing sweeping sanctions imposed under former president Joe Biden over the Ukraine assault. (AFP)

 A high-level Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Friday to advance efforts to prolong a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely paused hostilities with Israel, two senior Hamas officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The delegation will meet with Egyptian officials on Saturday to discuss the latest developments, assess progress in implementing the ceasefire agreement and address matters related to launching the second phase of the deal," said one official.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its talks with Egyptian mediators, the Hamas delegation will demand that Israel "implement the agreement, begin negotiations for the second phase, and open the border crossings to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian militant group seeks a "comprehensive agreement that ensures a permanent and complete ceasefire," the other official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hamas's demands for the second phase include a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, an end to the blockade, the reconstruction of the territory and financial support based on the decisions of this week's Arab summit in Cairo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire's first phase ended last weekend, after six weeks of relative calm that included exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Israel has said it wants to extend the first phase until mid-April, Hamas has insisted on a transition to the deal's second phase, which should lead to a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken by Palestinian militants during Hamas's October 2023 attack, which started the war, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military has said are dead. (AFP)

<img alt="The Gare du Nord station lies in northern Paris and is the country's busiest train hub. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794795_1_20250307191100.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of passengers in Paris and London were stranded on Friday, after the discovery of a World War II bomb on tracks leading to the Gare du Nord station halted traffic at France's busiest railway terminus.
 <br>
  <br>
  All traffic to the train station, which serves international, high-speed and local connections, was halted as police worked to disable the device. All Eurostar trains in Paris were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unexploded bomb was found "in the middle of the tracks" about 2.5 kilometres from the station overnight during maintenance work carried out in the northern Paris suburb of Saint Denis, the national SNCF rail company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bomb "dates back to World War II," the RER B suburban train firm, whose trains from Gare du Nord heading towards Charles de Gaulle airport have also been suspended, wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gare du Nord station lies in the north of the French capital and is the country's busiest train hub, hosting the Eurostar trains in addition to regional and suburban service, according to the SNCF.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many passengers could not mask their irritation at the sudden change of plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been waiting since 6:00 am for an RER to Goussainville," said 55-year-old Corinne Schiavenato, referring to a town north of Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to take a replacement bus but it's impossible, too many passengers, they're packed. I'm self-employed, I have a client who has been waiting for me since 7:00 am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others took the disruptions in stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's funny, I've just come back from Lorient where unexploded shells are discovered all the time," said Chloe Ternand, referring to a town in western France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot warned that rail traffic at Gare du Nord would remain "heavily disrupted all day" on Friday, which usually sees an increase in passengers due to weekend travel. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang said on Friday that six more Hongkongers trapped in scam farms in Myanmar have been rescued in a joint operation by the Security Bureau and authorities from the mainland, Thailand and Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the victims - three men and three women aged between 29 and 44 - had been held for five to seven months, after falling for job scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Myanmar soldiers rescued them overnight and sent them to Thailand, adding that they are in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the victims are scheduled to return to Hong Kong on Friday night, while the remaining person will stay in Thailand for at least one more day to assist with the ongoing probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a rescue operation, so we did not pay any ransom," the minister told reporters at the airport after returning from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "25 people, including these six, have returned, or will be returning to Hong Kong. The SAR government will spare no effort to rescue the remaining three people [trapped in Southeast Asia]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang was due to attend an event on Lantau on Thursday, but cancelled it at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he couldn't announce his trip because of the need to keep the rescue operation under wraps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also thanked Beijing officials from the Ministries of Public Security and Foreign Affairs, as well as authorities in Myanmar and Thailand for taking part in the mission.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's export growth grew slower than expected in the first two months of this year while imports fell sharply, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to customs data released on Friday, outbound shipments from China in January and February rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a gain of 10.7 percent in December and market expectations of a 5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slower pace was attributed partly to firms rushing out exports before the anticipated US tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports declined 8.4 percent year on year, after rising by 1 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the drop in imports of grain, iron ore and crude oil signalled that Beijing was scaling back on purchases of key commodities amid heightened tensions with the United States under  the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus for the two months came in at US$170 billion. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal scholar and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Albert Chen on Friday said the National Security Law can be amended, and that won't have retroactive effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after the SAR's top court overturned the convictions of three former members of Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for refusing to hand information to the police in a national security investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Hong Kong government said it will study the ruling, review how it enforces national security laws, and look for ways to improve them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK in Beijing, Chen said the Court of Final Appeal's ruling is reasonable and aligns with common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether changes are needed, he said Hong Kong's Committee for Safeguarding National Security is in charge of making rules for the National Security Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Laws can be amended at any time. Of course, these amendments won't have retrospective effect. But after the amendment, the court will need to make rulings based on the newly amended laws," the University of Hong Kong professor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This committee can decide to change the rules on its own without seeking approval from the National People's Congress, Chen added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court cancelled impeached President Yoon Suk-yeol's arrest warrant on Friday, paving the way for his release from jail following his arrest in mid-January on insurrection charges over a brief imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul Central District Court said in a statement that its ruling was based on the timing of the indictment that came after the initial detention period had expired, and noted "questions about the legality" of the investigation process that involved two separate agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 15, Yoon became the first sitting president to be arrested on criminal charges after days of a standoff between presidential guards and arresting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision to cancel the arrest showed this country's rule of law is still alive," Yoon's lawyers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers also said he may not be immediately released because prosecutors can appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not immediately comment on the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence team had argued that a warrant issued on January 19 that extended Yoon's detention was invalid because the request filed by prosecutors was procedurally flawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said his December 3 martial law declaration was needed to root out "anti-state" elements but lifted the decree six hours later after parliament voted to reject it. He has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks later he was impeached by the opposition-led parliament on accusations he had violated his constitutional duty by declaring martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court is expected to rule soon on his impeachment. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to act more firmly in safeguarding national security while recognising the city's effort in implementing Article 23 legislation, according to attendees at a meeting with the top official in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China's diplomacy provides much-needed stability in a turbulent world.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference during the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang was asked about China's role in the world on the diplomatic front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's diplomacy will stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. We will provide certainty to this uncertain world. We will be a staunch force defending our national interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Global South, Wang said Beijing will continue to expand global partnerships and "write a new chapter of the Global South seeking strength through unity".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Global South, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's GDP, should strengthen themselves and strive for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  As China and the European Union mark 50 years of diplomatic relations this year, Wang said Beijing is still confident that Europe can be its trusted trading partner despite tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two sides have the capacity and wisdom to properly resolve pending issues through friendly consultation and jointly usher in another promising 50 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang accused the Philippines of creating frictions in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said trust and rules are needed to help bring lasting peace and security in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said the island is an inalienable part of China and any attempts to seek "Taiwan independence" are doomed to fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Taiwan has never been a country and will never be a country in the future,” Wang said, adding that China will realise complete reunification.

    Pope releases audio message thanking the faithful

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A weak and breathless Pope Francis thanked people for their prayers for his recovery in a remarkable audio message broadcast on Thursday, the first public sign of life from the 88-year-old pope since he was hospitalized three weeks ago with double pneumonia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis’ feeble voice, discernible through his labored breaths and in his native Spanish, was recorded from the hospital and broadcast to the faithful in St. Peter’s Square who had gathered for the nightly recitation of the rosary prayer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here,” he said, his soft voice piercing the hushed square.
  <br>
  <br>
  “May God bless you and the Virgin protect you. Thank you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For anyone used to hearing Francis’ voice, which is often so soft it sounds like a whisper, the audio was an emotional punch to the gut that hammered home just how sick he is.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cardinal presiding over the prayer, Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime, had told the crowd at the start of the service that he had “beautiful news, a beautiful gift" to share.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearly surprised crowd broke into applause and then applauded again after Francis’ final “Gracias.” Fernández Artime, for his part, bowed his head as he listened.
  <br>

    Smart traffic control system to be tested in Kwun Tong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they hope traffic congestion in Kwun Tong would be eased following the implementation of a new smart traffic management system in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  The system, to be launched later this year, was co-developed with the University of Science and Technology’s Great Smart Cities Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received funding of HK$6.8 million from the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau to develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes installing 11 sets of CCTV cameras across nine streets in Kwun Tong's business area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic data will be collected round the clock, analysed real-time through AI and shared by the police and the Transport Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the system can show vehicle flow on different days and in different periods, as well as give suggestions on traffic lights control.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing, police chief inspector Terrence Yu said the collected data would not be used for enforcement and would be deleted after 28 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our idea was to use technology to better understand the traffic flow in the business area to provide us with the most appropriate arrangement. We won’t carry out enforcement based on the system, but we will make arrangements in areas like deployment of manpower based on the situation, and ask our colleagues to take appropriate traffic control measures,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yu said the force does not have specific performance indicators and would review the system in future before considering whether to expand it to other areas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has ushered in a golden era to develop the so-called "low altitude" economy, or even a "sky city", according to delegates at the country's top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as the annual "Two Sessions" continues in Beijing, featuring delegates at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Yang Yi, a CPPCC delegate, who is also a senior technical expert at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, said the low-altitude economy is one example of "new quality productive forces", as it has vast potential to open up a new industry while reshaping the current sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has ushered in the golden period of developing the low-altitude economy, it is now the industry's 'take-off' period, and the low-altitude economy will become a new engine of China's economic growth, to spark new consumption trends," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The idea of building a city in the sky will no longer be simply a dream," she added, noting this year's key tasks include gradually opening up the nation's aerial space, enhancing regulatory frameworks and safety, continuing technological innovation, while encouraging market engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xu Xiaolan, a vice chairperson of the standing committee of the CPPCC National Committee, who is also the vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, said the country's internet-based industrial production had expanded to cover 49 economic fields, involving some 1.53 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, a computer scientist, who is also the former vice minister of the Industry and Information Technology of China, added the latest breakthroughs achieved by DeepSeek have also been applied to various sectors including the search engines, text generating, medicine, culture, and tourism.

    China will 'firmly counter' US amid trade row: Wang Yi

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will "firmly counter" US pressure on trade, after Washington imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a press conference on Friday on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang also raised the risk that the "law of the jungle" could take hold in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China-US economic and trade ties are mutual. If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move by the Trump administration to impose additional tariffs using the fentanyl issue as a pretext, Wang said Washington should not "repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose arbitrary tariffs".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are around 190 countries in the world," he said. "Imagine if every country emphasised their own priority and believed in strength and status, the world would fall back into the law of the jungle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Major countries should undertake their international obligations… and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the abuse of fentanyl in the US is a problem that must be confronted and resolved by the country itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of AI in China and growing popularity of DeepSeek, the foreign minister said "high fences and small yards" cannot suppress the spirit of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that China and the US must co-exist peacefully, and mutual respect is key to bilateral ties. (Agencies)

 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said ties with Russia were a "constant in a turbulent world" as he addressed the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A mature, resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be disrupted by third-party interference," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China supports a plan by Egypt and other Arab countries to rebuild and restore peace in Gaza. (Agencies)

    Second measles-related death in US in a decade

<img alt="Measles testing takes place amid an outbreak in Texas. File Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794679_1_20250307093051.jpg&q=35">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A New Mexico resident who has died, tested positive for measles, the state health department said on Thursday, marking the second measles-related death in the United States in more than a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unvaccinated adult patient did not seek medical care before death, and was the first measles-related death in the state in more than 40 years, according to David Morgan, Public Information Officer for the New Mexico Department of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death is still under investigation by the state medical examiner, Morgan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death brings to 10 the number of measles cases that occurred in Lea County, located adjacent to Gaines County, Texas, where more than 100 cases and one death in an unvaccinated child have been reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outbreak, one of the largest the United States has seen in the past decade, has put US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine sceptic, to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy initially downplayed news that a school-aged child had died of measles, calling such outbreaks ordinary and failing to mention the role of vaccination to prevent measles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Kennedy published an opinion piece on Fox News that promoted the role of vaccination, but downplayed the role of vaccines by telling parents vaccination was a personal choice and urging them to consult with their physician.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the role of vitamin A, overstating evidence for its use, which has only been shown to decrease measles severity in developing countries among individuals who are malnourished and vitamin A deficient, said Dr Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of February 27, 164 measles cases have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in nine jurisdictions: Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island, and Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles typically kills 1 to 3 people per 1,000 cases, said Dr Tina Tan, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said two deaths out of a total of 164 cases suggest "a much higher mortality rate than we would normally see," adding that there are probably many undetected cases. (Reuters)

<img alt="President Trump listens as Rodolphe Saade, CEO of CMA CGM Group, speaks in the Oval Office. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794675_1_20250307092145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday said French-based shipping firm CMA CGM would invest US$20 billion in the United States to build out shipping logistics and terminals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration wants to revive shipbuilding in the United States and weaken China's grip on the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's team is preparing an executive order that would impose a levy on ships linked to China when they call at US ports, and wants US allies to do the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM is the world's third-largest container shipping line and is part of a vessel-sharing alliance with companies including China's COSCO.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM said last week that US port fees on China-built ships would have a big impact on all shipping firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday he would announce a new program for building ships in the United States next week or the following week, including incentives.
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM CEO Rodolphe Saade, who joined Trump in the Oval Office, confirmed the US$20 billion investment and said it would create 10,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment over four years would include expansion of container ports and the creation of an air cargo hub in Chicago supported by five new Boeing 777 freighters flown by American pilots, CMA CGM said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saade, a French-Lebanese billionaire who controls CMA CGM with other family members, told Trump at the White House that his group was looking at supporting the building of container ships and would make an announcement "in the coming weeks".
  <br>
  <br>
  CMA CGM operates port terminals in New York and Los Angeles. The Marseille-based firm is the biggest cargo carrier for US retail giant Walmart. (Reuters)

    Cyclone Alfred edges closer to Australia's east coast

<div class="itemFullText">
 Violent winds toppled power lines on Friday as a tropical cyclone inched towards Australia's eastern coast, sparking evacuation orders and leaving more than 50,000 homes without electricity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred was 165 kilometres east of Brisbane city on Friday morning, crawling towards the densely-populated coastline at "walking speed", government forecasts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre stretch of coastline straddling the border of Queensland state and New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a region rarely troubled by typhoons - it has been more than 50 years since a tropical cyclone made landfall in that part of Queensland.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 50,000 homes were without power on Friday morning as damaging winds brought down power lines, officials and utility companies said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Queensland Premier David Crisafulli said the storm already "packed a punch", warning conditions would get worse as it approached land late on Friday or early Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency response officials said they had issued evacuation orders for some 10,000 people in the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was particular concern for the town of Lismore, which was engulfed by record 14-metre floodwaters after heavy rains in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many residents have spent the past three days fortifying their homes with sandbags, tying down loose furniture and stocking up on food and water.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the region should "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When nature does its worst, Australians are at our best. We rally. We lift each other up. We look out for our neighbours," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tropical Cyclone Alfred would likely cross the coast "early Saturday morning", the Bureau of Meteorology said, although its path was becoming difficult to predict.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was forecast to make landfall around 60 kilometres north of Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 900 schools across Queensland state and neighbouring parts of northern New South Wales were closed on Friday, education department officials said. (AFP)

    SpaceX loses contact with Starship rocket after launch

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's SpaceX saw mixed results in the latest test launch of its Starship mega-rocket on Thursday, successfully catching the massive booster but with the upper stage failing for the second consecutive time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minutes after lift-off and booster separation, a video live feed showed the upper stage tumbling uncontrollably, with signal soon cutting out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Can confirm we did lose contact with the ship. Unfortunately, this happened last time, too," SpaceX official Dan Huot said, alluding to the January launch that saw the upper stage explode over the Caribbean, raining debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new setback could fuel questions over Musk's attention to his space company, as the billionaire spends most of his time in Washington leading US President Donald Trump's government overhaul efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  That work has also prompted mounted scrutiny over Musk's influence on the US government space program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful launch vehicle, successfully blasted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas shortly after 5:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Starship's eighth orbital mission - all so far uncrewed - and the first since its dramatic mid-air explosion over the Caribbean during its last trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing contact with the upper stage again, SpaceX managed to return the huge booster stage to the launch tower - catching it with arms called "chopsticks." It was the third time SpaceX completed the tricky engineering feat.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 40 minutes after the launch, Spacex turned off its livestream and the fate of the errant upper stage was not immediately known. (AFP)

    'Govt should seek new revenue streams amid deficit'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their retreat on Thursday, falling hard ahead of key US jobs data as markets shrugged off President Trump's latest moves to soften tariff actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, but the shift was not enough to spark a change in stock market activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down one percent at 42.579, after spending the entire session in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent to 5,738, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.6 percent to 18,069.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management said the uncertainty around trade policy is "affecting the real economy," dragging down consumer sentiment and business investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The longer that goes on, the more the economy slows," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again to boost the struggling eurozone, but suggested the easing could be nearing an end and warned of "rising uncertainty" amid massive German spending plans and US tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large tech firms were among the bigger losers Thursday, including Netflix, down 8.5 percent, Tesla, down 5.6 percent and Nvidia, down 5.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report for February. Weekly jobless claims figures released on Thursday were better than expected, while Wednesday's private payroll report from ADP lagged estimates. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United drew 1-1 away to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, while Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee drilled in from just outside the area to give United the lead on 57 minutes in San Sebastian, but Mikel Oyarzabal levelled from the spot after Bruno Fernandes was punished for a handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee cut a distraught figure after missing the decisive penalty in last week's FA Cup shootout loss to Fulham and has endured a testing first season at United, whose only remaining hope of silverware is in the Europa League.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored for the first time in Europe this term, unleashing a sharp low drive from 20 yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho's inviting pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ruben Amorim's side could not hold on to their advantage as Fernandes handled at a corner, with Oyarzabal confidently converting his spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andre Onana made two excellent saves to keep United level as Real Sociedad pressed for a winner, leaving the tie evenly poised ahead of next week's second leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt until the penalty we had control of the game and then I think the penalty changed a little bit the momentum," Amorim said. "I felt our team in the last 30 minutes were really, really tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take this stage to Old Trafford, and it's going to be a different game," he added. "The pressure is going to be on us in that stadium and we have to be ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Bergvall's first-half own goal condemned Spurs to defeat in the Netherlands, and it could have been worse for Ange Postecoglou's side were it not for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Rangers recorded an impressive 3-1 win away to a Fenerbahce team coached by Jose Mourinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyriel Dessers put Rangers ahead early on in Istanbul before Alexander Djiku hauled Fenerbahce level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaclav Cerny restored the lead for the Scots before striking again nine minutes from time to place Rangers in firm control under interim boss Barry Ferguson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon also took a big stride towards the quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory at Romanians FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Fonseca fought back tears as his players celebrated Nicolas Tagliafico's opener with him, a day after the Portuguese coach was banned from the dugout until November by French football officials after an angry altercation with a referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Fofana won the game for Lyon with two late goals after Alexandru Baluta had equalised for FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma host Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday, while Ajax are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Lazio travel to Viktoria Plzen for the first leg of their tie. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday underscored the role of education in advancing science, technology, and talent development, calling for deeper alignment with the country's modernisation needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a joint group meeting during the third session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi emphasised cultivating talent, maximising their potential, and integrating education with national priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called for comprehensive education reforms, including granting schools greater autonomy and improving governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the need to instill in students the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education must play a fundamental role in fostering innovation and self-reliant talent training, Xi said, calling for mechanisms to align education with economic and social development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the CPPCC's role in supporting national education and talent strategies.
  <br>

    Trump backs off Mexico, Canada tariffs

<img alt="US President Donald Trump said after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that fresh tariffs targeting Mexico would not apply to trade that falls under an existing regional pact. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794641_1_20250307042023.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, providing some reprieve to companies and consumers after blowback on financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  After his sweeping tariffs of up to 25 percent on the two US neighbors took effect on Tuesday, stock markets tumbled, while economists warned that blanket levies could weigh on US growth and raise inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed orders Thursday to delay fresh levies for Canadian and Mexican imports covered by a North American trade agreement, though he dismissed suggestions that his decisions were linked to market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The halt, which lasts until April 2, came one day after the White House announced similar relief for automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following talks with the "Big Three" US automakers Stellantis, Ford and General Motors, Trump decided to give a one-month exemption on autos coming through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told reporters that about 62 percent of Canadian imports will still face the new tariffs, although much of these are energy imports hit by a lower rate of 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of Mexican imports come through the USMCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest moves make conditions "much more favorable for our American car manufacturers," Trump said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added that major moves would be unveiled on April 2, the date that he has promised "reciprocal tariffs" to remedy practices Washington deems unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point, Canadian and Mexican goods could still face levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president also said he would not modify broad tariffs for steel and aluminum, which are due to take effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office that he had a "very good conversation" with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  His remarks stood in sharp contrast to the simmering tensions with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau said on Thursday that Ottawa will remain in a trade war with Washington for "the foreseeable future" even if there are "breaks for certain sectors." (AFP)

    Ireland's Doris fit to face France in Six Nations

<img alt="Irish captain Caelan Doris will earn his 50th cap in Saturday's crucial match against France in Dublin. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794627_1_20250306222902.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish captain Caelan Doris is fit and will face France, handing a massive boost to Ireland ahead of their potential Six Nations title decider in Dublin on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old No 8, who missed the win over Wales last month owing to a knee injury, will win his 50th cap and is one of four changes to the starting XV from the Welsh match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fullback Hugo Keenan returns, as does prop Finlay Bealham, who was a replacement against the Welsh, and Bundee Aki comes in to partner Robbie Henshaw in the centres for the suspended Garry Ringrose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Caelan has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness," Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It says a lot about him that he has done as many other players might not have been able to do that in such a short space of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Osborne, who stood in for Keenan against Wales, moves to the wing as Mack Hansen has a thigh injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby said Osborne's versatility earned him the nod ahead of an out-and-out winger such as Calvin Nash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt it was right to give him (Osborne) the right wing as it gives us coverage across the backs due to his versatility," said Easterby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mack (Hansen) was touch and go, but he was comfortable with the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson-Park, who have been outstanding thus far, will form the half-back partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Conan, who started the Wales game instead of the injured Doris, has also recovered from a lower back problem and will be on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Bealham and Doris, Conan is set for his 50th Test appearance. (AFP)
