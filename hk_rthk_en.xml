<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781061_1_20241127153405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four who lodged the appeals were among those who pleaded not guilty but were convicted after trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was slapped with a jail sentence of seven years and nine months; Yu received a prison term of six years and nine months; and Wong and Yeung were each sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail.

    Auditor urges closer scrutiny of drone registrations

<img alt="The Audit Commission says it found numerous cases of " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781056_1_20241127152110.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission has urged the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) to improve its verification procedures when registering drones, after finding multiple cases of "odd data" in the system.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commission said it looked at some of the more than 24,000 drone registrations recorded via the Electronic Portal for Small Unmanned Aircraft (eSUA) as of June this year, and found numerous discrepancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rules on flying drones in Hong Kong, such as whether permission is needed from the authorities, vary depending – among other things – on the weight of the aircraft in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in some cases, the recorded weight of drones registered in the database did not match the standard weight for their model and appear to have ended up in the wrong category, the commission said in a report released on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that while drones should have a unique serial number, dozens in the database had duplicate numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another issue flagged up in the report was eSUA account holders deleting their accounts without deregistering their drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If an eSUA account has been deleted, there may no longer be any responsible person for the valid SUA [Small Unmanned Aircraft] held under the deleted account," the commission warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also discovered that as of June 30, several thousand registrations were "under verification" – with more than 1,250 languishing under this status for more than two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission linked this to an earlier move by the authorities to streamline the registration process by scrapping a requirement for owners to provide a photograph of the registration label attached to their drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While CAD has drawn up plans and taken measures to handle the SUA under verification by 30 November 2024, CAD needs to continue to closely monitor the handling of the SUA under verification and take measures to ensure that those cases will be properly followed through," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that as of the end of June, the CAD had dealt with 38 cases of suspected violations of the SUA Order under the Civil Aviation Ordinance, of which 13 involved tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These indicated that visitors might not be well aware of the requirements under the SUA Order. With a view to enhancing the awareness of visitors on the SUA Order, CAD needs to make sustained efforts in arranging publicity and education targeting visitors," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Victor Liu, said he generally agrees with the commission's recommendations.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday launched an investigation after a six-metre-tall noise barrier along a road in Tsuen Wan caught fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate when the force received multiple fire reports at about 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters took about half an hour to put out the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, aged 85, reported that she felt unwell after inhaling smoke, but she did not have to be hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After our preliminary investigation, it is believed that debris at the scene caught fire. At this stage, there's no evidence showing the case involves criminal elements," the force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tsuen Wan criminal investigation unit is looking into the case, police added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted online showed the structure engulfed in flames. "Wow, it's burning through the top," one driver in a video remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another said: "There's no way we can drive through this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire forced parts of Cheung Pei Shan Road to close, with motorists advised to use alternative routes.

    Help make HK a green finance hub, CE tells bankers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday told the banking sector to gear up and help realise the government's vision of turning Hong Kong into a regional green finance hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon session hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Lee pointed out that the government has issued HK$220 billion worth of green and sustainable bonds since May 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a roadmap will soon be released to guide financial institutions in meeting international sustainable standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming weeks, we will launch a roadmap on the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards on Sustainability Disclosure. We aspire to make Hong Kong among the world's first jurisdictions to align local requirements with international sustainability reporting requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chief executive noted that the government is just as committed to supporting the financial sector in innovation and adopting new technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a new subsidy scheme launched earlier this year which gives a maximum grant of HK$150,000 for each approved fintech project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The establishment in June of a dedicated proof-of-concept subsidy scheme for green fintech makes that clear. Among other things, it will provide early stage funding support for pre-commercialised green fintech projects,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Beyond its value in green and sustainable finance, fintech can help companies tap into new technology, including AI and blockchain, to boost efficiency and stay abreast of the competition.”

 South Korea’s weather agency said the capital, Seoul, was blanketed on Wednesday by the heaviest November snowfall since records began over a century ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The snowstorm grounded hundreds of flights and disrupted commuter traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said 20 centimetres of snow fell in northern parts of Seoul and nearby areas, compared to the city's previous record of 12.4 centimetres on November 28, 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm blanketed much of the country, with the country’s central, eastern and southwestern regions seeing about 10 to 23 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 220 flights were cancelled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul, while emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, signs, and other safety risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather agency said snowfall would continue in most parts of the country until Thursday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they arrested five men and two women in a series of anti-drugs operations this month involving "space oil" and an anaesthetic called etomidate, which is illegal to posses unless prescribed by a doctor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said their operations led to the seizure of space oil capsules and etomidate powder with a total estimated market value of around HK$17 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gaining popularity of space oil or etomidate, which is currently a part one poison abused by the young people, has aroused our enforcement attention," said acting assistant commissioner Wong Ho-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The success of our enforcement in November demonstrates the strong determination of Hong Kong Customs in detecting the crimes relating to illicit etomidate or space oil," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that etomidate can cause tremors, dizziness, hallucinations and even brain damage.

    HKU to ensure Hong Kong's doctor supply

 The head of the University of Hong Kong's medical faculty said on Wednesday that it is important to ensure that support for all medical schools will continue after the establishment of a third such institute in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said earlier that a medical school will be set up in the Northern Metropolis. So far, three universities have submitted proposals to run it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lau Chak-sing said HKU will help ensure there are enough doctors to serve the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to do our very best in training the best doctors with diversification, so they will not just be good in looking after patients, but also have a good understanding of disease mechanism, medical and health research, and be able to contribute to research development in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the university's plan to establish a new graduate-entry medical programme can help produce the right doctors for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been receiving students who have completed a first degree before joining us in studying medicine [as a second bachelor's degree]. We have some experience in these students, and these students are more mature, more empathetic, and we find this is a useful development within the medical faculty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau said the faculty's new clinical trial centre in Hetao which opened last week will provide a one-stop platform for training medical talent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre aims to increase the standards of clinical trials by coordinating different stakeholders' needs, including the two existing medical schools, and public and private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute is a common platform to facilitate clinical trials development in Hong Kong, we hope to attract industry investment in Hong Kong, attract clinical trials to be performed and conducted in Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the centre will train as much talent as possible so the city's medical industry can continue to thrive.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is proposing that landlords who rent out poor quality subdivided flats face prison terms of up to three years and fines as high as HK$300,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans to regulate such cramped homes include a minimum flat size of 86 square feet, or eight square metres, with rooms having a minimum height of 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Documents submitted to Legco on Wednesday set out proposals for further requirements, including fire detectors and fire-resistant walls, as well as a ban on toilets being placed on balconies or outer corridors of buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say as well as proper ventilation and lighting, each subdivided flat should have its own water and electrical meters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Bureau says renting out a flat that isn't certified would also be illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the plans on December 2, with a public consultation exercise beginning the following day and lasting until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau says it hopes the bill will be passed next year and that registration of subdivided flats can get underway in the final quarter.

    Aussie social media bill closer to becoming law

<img alt="Australian legislation banning social media for people under 16 is closer to reality after it passed through the country's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781021_1_20241127122816.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament's lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet's Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia's House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With widespread support of the bill, analysts said this all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for systemic breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licences. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,” Tehan told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some youth advocates including Australia's human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children's rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Australians backed the ban, up from 61 percent in an August survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were criticisms the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would “make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,” Daniel told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,” she added. (Agencies)

    Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah takes effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took effect on Wednesday, after more than a year of fighting that has killed thousands of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce, which began before dawn, should bring a halt to a war that has forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and hundreds of thousands more in Lebanon to flee their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire does not address the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's security cabinet approved the US-France-brokered agreement after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented it, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war has seen swathes of Lebanon pounded by air strikes and Israeli troops deployed across the border to battle Hezbollah militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It began with Hezbollah launching cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since then -- most of them in the past several weeks, when Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say. (Agencies)

    Lawmaker labels new arts blueprint 'a breakthrough'

<img alt="Works by German artist Markus Lupertz on display at this year's Art Basel Hong Kong. Under the government's blueprint, the city will strive to become an East-meets-West cultural exchange hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of the government's Advisory Committee on Arts Development says a new blueprint for the sector is a big leap forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng told Hong Kong Today's Ben Tse that the development plan was very comprehensive and could build up the city as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges, as expressed in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government unveiled its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development on Tuesday, with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It spells out four key directions, including promoting Chinese culture, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng told RTHK that the overhaul of arts funding was a "big breakthrough" that would see greater support towards individual artists or smaller groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that some small and medium-sized artist groups will be funded by the ADC (Arts Development Council), while the nine largest major performing arts groups will be supported by ACAD (Advisory Committee on Arts Development). I think we can see that in between, there's some mobility we can enhance in order to support individuals, small artists to get funding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, government subventions are given to nine major performing arts groups - including the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chung Ying Theatre Company - and grants to small and medium arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said that by striving to become an East-meets-West regional arts hub, tourism and other sectors in Hong Kong would also benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was hopeful that more film festivals, art auctions and art tech exhibitions could be hosted in the SAR.

 The public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR on December 8, a day after a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said the names of the giant pandas, which arrived here from Sichuan in September, will be unveiled by officials at the ceremony, following a naming competition organised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he and his wife recently visited the pandas with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that the pair of giant pandas were energetic and lively," he wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The park told me that the pair have adapted to their new environment very quickly, and they're doing well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair's addition raises to six the number of giant pandas currently in the SAR, after Ying Ying gave birth to a pair of cubs in August.

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media shrugged off US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing him of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, said on Monday that he would impose "an additional 10 percent tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation, after Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is far-fetched," China Daily said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the US lies with the US itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in tariff wars. If the US continues to politicise economic and trade issues by weaponising tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday also pledged 25 percent tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had a "good" conversation with Trump immediately following the president-elect's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth," as well as "some of the challenges that we can work on together," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian leader has assembled a team of ministers to lobby US lawmakers and members of Trump's inner circle, a repeat of a charm offensive during his first term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested on Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues but said drugs were a US problem. (Agencies)

 A former inmate has credited a local charity with helping him reintegrate into society and overcome many challenges in his life.
 <br>
  <br>
  John has now become one of the ambassadors of the Sports Change Life Foundation, which provides sports companionship and mentorship to inmates, rehabilitated individuals and those facing adversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC) and has organised the project "Free Running Peer Exercise Reform Plan - Join Together to Save Calories for the Warmth Campaign".
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea is that the number of calories burnt during the exercise is exchanged for food and Christmas meals to be donated to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, I don't believe that I can keep running for 10 kilometres. But through this kind of practice, step by step, I can break through some obstacles and make me to build up my confidence and let me to believe that I can stand up again. It's very important to me to build a positive mindset to myself that helps me to reintegrate into the society," said John (not his real name).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fundraising director Chu Ki-sum said peer-running programmes were designed to train inmates and rehabilitated individuals as ambassadors, who eventually visit schools to share their experiences, inspire youth to steer clear of drugs and crime, promote healthy values, and prevent delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>
  John added that the funding would cover expenses for professional coaching, running equipment, resources, and school visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the training and also after the training we have some gathering so this gathering can build a friendship to support them and just like the guardians to help them to integrate into society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in a Champions League thriller on Tuesday and extend their winless run to six games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions did snap a five-game losing streak, but did little to boost confidence ahead of Sunday's trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool by conceding three times in the final 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola admitted his star-studded squad were "fragile" and lacking in confidence after the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two goals from Erling Haaland, either side of Ilkay Gundogan's deflected effort, looked set to restore some order for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defensive frailties that have been the root cause for a staggering collapse in recent weeks was exposed in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko hit back to salvage a vital point for the Dutch giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We concede a lot of goals because we are not stable," said Guardiola. "We lost a lot of games lately – we are fragile, and of course we need a victory."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game [at 3-0] was good for the confidence, playing at a good level and the first time something happens we have problems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draw leaves City with plenty of work to do to reach the knockout stages with trips to Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain to come in their next two Champions League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top eight progress directly to the last 16 with a place in the top 24 of the 36-team table enough to reach the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  City drop to 15th on eight points from five matches, just one point ahead of Feyenoord in 20th. (AFP)

<img alt="Inter Milan's Stefan de Vrij waves to fans after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780968_1_20241127072051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig meanwhile remain on no points after a fifth defeat in as many games in the Champions League, with even qualification for the play-offs looking tricky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal extended their revival with a ruthless 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side ended a three-match winless run in all competitions by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard netted late on to give Arsenal five away goals in a Champions League game for the first time since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's third win in five Champions League matches this season lifted them into seventh place, with the top eight teams in the revamped tournament earning automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting's first defeat in Europe's elite club competition this season leaves them below Arsenal on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their dip, but this swaggering effort suggested they are finally back in the groove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta had challenged Arsenal to make a statement against Sporting and they responded in emphatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners' first away win in the Champions League in six attempts was a welcome tonic after a 1-0 loss at Inter Milan in their last European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's impressive performance was all the more notable as Sporting had crushed Manchester City 4-1 in their final Champions League game under Ruben Amorim, who has since taken charge of Manchester United. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A first-half header from Min-jae Kim guided Bayern Munich to a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, worsening the French side's hopes of progressing in the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre-back scored after an error from PSG goalkeeper Matvei Safonov, starting ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who spilled the ball into Kim's path.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean's effort was the only goal in the rematch of 2020's Champions League final, won by Bayern by the same scoreline, and all but extinguishes PSG's hopes of a top-eight finish and avoiding the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ousmane Dembele picked up a second yellow for an unnecessary challenge with half an hour remaining, with Bayern successfully shutting up shop as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just three games remaining, even making the knockouts is not a given for the French champions, who are in 26th spot – outside the playoff placings.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG host Manchester City in January along with facing tricky away trips to Red Bull Salzburg and Stuttgart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's top-eight hopes look rosier after the win, which extended their run of clean sheets to seven straight games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern now sit 11th and take on relative European minnows Shakhtar Donetsk, Feyenoord and Slovan Bratislava in their remaining games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides came into the game unbeaten and six points clear in their domestic leagues but in dire need of points in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern coach Vincent Kompany opted for the speed of Leroy Sane over the creativity of France winger Michael Olise up front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG boss Luis Enrique made five changes to his side but it was his decision to stick with goalkeeper Safonov, rather than Donnarumma, who had played all but one Champions League game this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enrique defended his call before the game, telling reporters "I make my choices based on what I see on the pitch and what's best for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision appeared to pay off early, with Safonov responsible for good saves from Jamal Musiala and Leroy Sane inside the opening 12 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kingsley Coman, the PSG academy product who scored the only goal in the 2020 final, almost broke the deadlock shortly afterwards, dribbling through five defenders and blasting just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After PSG had a few opportunities of their own, including Joao Neves' long-range effort whistling past the goalpost on 33 minutes, the Russian goalkeeper made a mistake which led directly to the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich swung in a corner on the 38-minute mark which Safonov spilled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim was on the spot to power an ascending header against Safonov's momentum and into the top left corner of the net, his first Champions League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern were happy to let the game come to them in the second-half but Dembele's second yellow – his first had come for dissent – took the steam out of PSG's hopes of a comeback. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780964_1_20241127065203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered to fresh records on Tuesday, shrugging off a threat from President-elect Donald Trump to enact new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,860, its third straight closing record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 6,021, also a record, while the Nasdaq gained 0.6 percent to 19,174.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who doesn't take office until January 20, made his threat in social media posts on Monday night, announcing huge import tariffs against neighbours Canada and Mexico and also China, if they do not stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors view Trump's inclination towards trade protectionism as a headwind to economic growth and higher equity prices. But Tuesday's response suggests the market views the warning as a bargaining chip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In theory, higher tariffs should not be good news for stocks. But, you know, I think the market's chosen to think of (it) as a negotiating tactic," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have bullish sentiment," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "People are tending to look at things as positively as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other economic news, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 111.7 this month, up from 109.6 in October, boosted by greater optimism surrounding the labour market.

  Among individual companies, Best Buy tumbled 4.9 percent as it cut its full-year sales outlook after a big slowdown in sales leading into the presidential election. The electronics retailer said sales have rebounded since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other retailers also fell, including Burlington Stores, down 1.6 percent; Dick's Sporting Goods, down 1.4 percent; and Kohl's, down 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amgen dropped 4.8 percent after reporting that trials of its MariTide drug led to weight loss of up to 20 percent after 52 weeks. The drop in shares appeared to show disappointment that the impact was not even greater. (AFP)

    Russia vows response to latest Ukraine ATACMS strikes

<div class="itemFullText">
 Moscow's military on Tuesday pledged a response to fresh Ukrainian air attacks inside Russia using US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine firing the long-range missiles into Russia for the first time last week prompted a furious reaction from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes on November 23 and 25 using ATACMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Retaliatory actions are being prepared," it said in a post on Telegram, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave Ukraine permission to use the weapons to hit Russian territory earlier this month after months of requests from Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rare admission, Russia said the fresh strikes had caused damage to military hardware and wounded some of its personnel on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the Kursk Vostochny air base wounded two servicemen, the defence ministry said, while a strike on an air defence battery damaged a radar system and also caused "casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three of the five missiles fired in the first strike were shot down, while seven of the eight used in the second were destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow rarely provides such specific details on Ukrainian aerial attacks and almost never admits missiles have reached their intended target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry also posted photos of what it said were the missile fragments, showing large casings with English-language inscriptions on the side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The images could not be immediately verified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come with tensions having ratcheted up dramatically in the near three-year conflict over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, days before launching the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday strongly disapproved and opposed a letter from US politicians to the country’s treasury secretary, saying that it damages the SAR’s reputation as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  An SAR government spokesman stressed that the allegations had no factual basis and the letter was a “crude and reprehensible attempt to spread lies and misinformation about Hong Kong for personal political gain”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government “has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that maintaining the integrity and robustness of the city's financial systems is a top priority for the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system in this area, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter by US lawmakers alleged Hong Kong is playing an "increasing role as a financial hub for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illicit financial activities".

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTN South Africa has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China Telecom and Huawei for strategic collaboration that could advance the mobile operator's offerings in 5G, cloud, AI and business solutions, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership unites China Telecom's global expertise in network solutions with MTN's expansive regional reach and Huawei's advanced technology, creating a powerful alliance to drive digital infrastructure development on the continent," said Kai Chen, executive vice president of China Telecom Global .
  <br>
  <br>
  MTN South Africa, the country's second biggest mobile operator, said the partnership would unlock new business opportunities and offer South Africans enhanced technology, including the internet of things.
  <br>
  <br>
  The internet of things, or IoT, describes devices connecting to the internet that aren't primarily computers, such as fridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For MTN's business customers, network service improvements could offer new possibilities in smart mining and industrial applications," said Tumi Sekhukhune-Chamayou, chief enterprise business officer at MTN South Africa. (Reuters)

    Biden proposes weight loss drugs under Medicare

<img alt="Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese would qualify for coverage. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780923_1_20241126195823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The costly proposal from the US Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labelled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as US$35 billion over the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. “It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rule would not be finalised until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they arrested 59 people, after officers busted syndicates allegedly linked to loan shark and illegal debt collection activities involving a total of more than HK$39 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The force said the suspects, between the ages of 20 and 76, are alleged to have targeted foreign domestic helpers
  <br>
  <br>
  They said syndicate members used different methods to deduct the amount of money the borrower actually received, such as forcing them to purchase goods or pay administration fees. The victims then had to repay the loan at a high-interest rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The syndicate took advantage of lenders who have borrowing needs,” said Ho Yan-ki, the Chief Inspector of Hong Kong Island Regional Crime Unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers seized over HK$1 million in cash, passports, employment contracts and loan agreements during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho encouraged foreign domestic helpers and their employers to contact police if they encountered such loan shark syndicates.

    World oldest man John Tinniswood dies aged 112

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.

<img alt="Mathias Woo says he hopes more performance venues in the West Kowloon Cultural District can launch long-term partnerships with theatre groups.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A renowned theatre producer and curator on Tuesday welcomed the government's new roadmap on promoting arts and culture development in Hong Kong, saying it provides a comprehensive plan for the sector's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mathias Woo, co-Artistic director and executive director of Zuni Icosahedron, said the 71 measures in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development are very comprehensive, covering almost all aspects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It covers venues, it covers exchange, it covers personnel training, facility, [role of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority]. Somehow I think it's a very, very good start,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said he hopes the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority can more proactively reach out to art groups and allow them long-term use of its performance venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The blueprint mentioned that the authority should pick up a stronger role in facilitating culture and creative industry. I think it has to strengthen its connection with the industry and also to build a more content-based venue, which means, like in London, you have the Royal Ballet, the art groups have their own venue and their own home base,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam Kwok-kan, a member of the Arts Development Council, also welcomed the news, especially the idea of industrialising the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The industrialisation of art and culture makes it something that can involve people, involve talents, involve artists, not just in their own production, in their own creativity, but also make their work marketable,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who’s also the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Hang Seng University, said he believes this focus can help showcase the work of arts groups to the outside world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many of the art groups in Hong Kong do not know how to market their products. So this blueprint has a focus on marketisation, not just let the different art groups to work alone, but to create synergies among them, and to build a platform for them to market their work, not just in Hong Kong, not just in China, but also in places outside Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that he thinks the government should accord priority to developing the theatre and film industries, saying theatre performances and movies are good ways to attract tourists and showcase Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis sensation Andrey Rublev says he is looking forward to playing in Hong Kong again, emphasising that having a strong mindset sets the stage for his entire tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World No. 8 player is eager to defend his title at the Hong Kong Tennis Open 2025, which will take place from December 29 to January 5 at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev said he is excited for the event, adding that the unwavering support of the SAR fans and the welcoming environment boosted his comfort and motivation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great the atmosphere there last year. There was a lot of people who came from [the mainland] to watch me play and it was nice. It's a bit different compared to Europe audience because in general in Asia, they like to draw some posters," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They like to draw. Some put something on the face or to wear the flags or to wear some T-shirts with some signs. Last year, I remember there was a lot of people that had a flag with my photo and it was nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev exited the 2024 ATP Finals more than a week ago without securing a victory, having been defeated in his last match against Casper Ruud, but he said he is actively enhancing his physical abilities to boost his speed for the upcoming tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he opts to refrain from setting rigid goals to prevent burnout, and instead focuses on enjoying the sport he loves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working much more in a bit in a different direction and I start to feel that I'm doing this better, so I just want to keep doing that, to play better at the net because, especially now, there is many matches that somehow can be one or two points different and this one or two points different [is] because I didn't play well at the net and then the other guy, when he went to the net and I tried to pass him he played really well and that was the difference in the most important time and the most important moment of the match," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things like that with the serve with the changing a bit of the rhythm, I start to hit better because I start to feel that I'm doing it better. We'll see just to keep doing them because in the end, it's not about preseason. It's a bit like a daily routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to do it a bit every day. It doesn't matter if you're in a tournament or not. That's it. It's something that we were doing the last couple of months and it's just now preseason and we have even more time to do it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan announced on Tuesday that he has launched an investigation into construction waste recycling services provided by the government, as well as its work in combating illegal dumping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme almost two decades ago and also rolled out a pilot scheme in 2021 for people to make reservations for recycling construction waste through the app "HoHoSkips".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan noted that waste is still illegally disposed of in public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only causes inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affects environmental hygiene and requires additional public resources for disposal," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said data suggests the app might be underused.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have decided to launch this direct investigation operation to scrutinise the existing management of construction waste, including the EPD's control and preventive measures against illegal disposal of construction waste, specific details and operating situations of the 'HoHoSkips' service, how its effectiveness is monitored, and relevant promotion and publicity initiatives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until December 27 to submit any views they have on the matter.

    Govt 'respects' CFA ruling on same-sex couples

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government and the Housing Authority on Tuesday both said they respect the top court's ruling that grants subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal affirmed lower court rulings made earlier, saying that it also finds current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will study the judgment thoroughly and seek legal advice from the Department of Justice for appropriate follow-up actions," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Housing Authority spokesman also said it will study the judgment in detail and seek legal advice where necessary for taking follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the litigants involved in the case, Nick Infinger, said he is happy he won the case after a six-year legal battle, saying this means same-sex couples have the right to live together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he hopes Hong Kong can become more equal and fair. "I feel quite excited because the court made the judgment in favour of us," he said outside court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the most important thing is not only fighting for me and for my partner, but this is fighting for all the same-sex couples in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow expressed concern over the verdict, saying it might affect public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would foresee following the verdict today there might be a lot of same-sex couples
  <br>
  getting married abroad and then they come back to Hong Kong and apply for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  So the question now is what is the impact on the public housing resources to be allocated to traditional families? These are the concerns shared by the general public," he said.

    Govt unveils arts and culture industry blueprint

<img alt='Under the blueprint, Hong Kong should strive to become an "East-meets-West" centre for international cultural exchange. Photo: RTHK.' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780865_1_20241126150410.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has vowed to leverage Hong Kong's strengths to make the SAR an international cultural exchange centre, as it unveiled a development plan with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development spells out four key directions -- promoting Chinese culture, developing diverse creative industries, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes 71 measures covering industries such as film, music, and performing arts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the initiatives have commenced, with the remaining beginning from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, the administration said, is to turn Hong Kong into an "East-meets-West" centre for international cultural exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Tuesday said the blueprint is a "macro policy document" that is not "cast in stone".
  <br>
  <br>
  "One unique aspect of art and creative industries is that they evolve over time with social development. The specific measures won't remain unchanged," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll keep an open mind when discussing with industry stakeholders. We'll review priorities for individual development paths and measures, explore new ideas aligned with the blueprint's vision and principles, and provide support with our resources."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope the economic benefit generated by creative industries will go from HK$122 billion in 2022 to HK$200 billion by 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal is for the number of jobs generated by such sectors to rise from more than 220,000, to 264,000 over the same period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include establishing a museum in the Northern Metropolis on the nation's development and achievements; displaying works of local artists and designers in government offices and buildings as a bid to make Hong Kong the "capital of creativity"; and promoting the city's unique pop culture on the mainland and around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  On enhancing the ecosystem, the blueprint mentions a comprehensive review of the current funding mechanism for arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said groups could be added to, or removed from, the subsidised list, although not based on one individual factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over time, we aim to maintain a balance in our different funding systems by considering various factors, and we plan to keep this approach in the future," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look at things like the individual art level, audience response, the impact on promoting sector growth, and whether the ideas are innovative. All these factors could serve as criteria when we update the funding mechanism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint puts an emphasis on participation from the whole of society and it shouldn't only be the government that pours in resources for arts and culture, the minister added.

    CFA affirms housing rights of same-sex couples

<img alt="The five-judge panel of the top court unanimously rejects the appeal from the Housing Authority. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780848_1_20241126121312.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has affirmed earlier court rulings granting subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples, after finding current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-judge panel of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, unanimously rejected an appeal from the Housing Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lower courts had granted the rights to subsidised housing benefits to two same-sex couples married overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA on Tuesday rejected the Housing Authority's argument that under the Basic Law, only opposite-sex married couples are entitled to apply for public housing, overriding provisions on equality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges held that while only opposite-sex couples can obtain the legal status of marriage under Hong Kong's constitutional framework, this doesn't shield housing policies from scrutiny under equality provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entitlements to apply for [public rental housing] units and [Home Ownership Scheme] flats are only some of those [legal] rights, but they do not go to the status of marriage itself," the judgement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Basic Law article on marriage] therefore does not remove the subject Housing Authority policies from the purview of the equality provisions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing body had also argued that same-sex and heterosexual married couples weren't comparable because the latter can give birth, therefore supporting the government's policy objective on population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges rejected this argument, saying same-sex couples can adopt children or have children through artificial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said they found the authority's policies aimed at supporting traditional family to be "disproportionate and unjustified", saying it didn't offer enough evidence over their arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said the authority did not address the likely effect on housing supply or the impact on opposite-sex couples if the policies were relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA dismissed the authority's appeal and ordered it to pay for the legal costs of the respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also ruled against the government in a related case regarding the inheritance of property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Ng, now deceased, had wished to add his same-sex spouse as a registered occupant and joint owner to a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for justice had argued that foreign same-sex marriages aren't comparable to heterosexual marriages when it comes to inheritance rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA judges ruled that excluding same-sex spouses from inheritance amounted to unlawful discrimination.

    Service sector staff more stressed since pandemic: HKU

<img alt="Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say stress issues of employees in the service industry must be addressed. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780854_1_20241126140259.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 University of Hong Kong (HKU) researchers on Tuesday said stress levels of employees in the service industry must be dealt with for the SAR to further promote the hospitality sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's business school, together with the Hong Kong Association for Customer Service Excellence (HKACE), conducted three rounds of studies during and after Covid, involving about 1,000 employees in the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they found that employees are now more stressed out, with almost 45 percent reporting they frequently experienced burnout in the post-pandemic period, up from 15 percent during the Covid crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennett Yim, a marketing professor with the school, described the survey findings as "shocking", adding that people had had high hopes for society to rebound after Covid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses have not improved substantially. A lot of the organisations and companies on one hand want to rebuild their business, and at the same time, customers also have high expectations in the post-Covid period," Yim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the two things come together, they're putting a lot of pressure on employees who are providing services to customers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yim said the stress issues of employees, especially frontline workers, must be addressed for the city to further promote the hospitality sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more tourists returning to Hong Kong. At the same time, we see a manpower shortage, particularly in the service industry. Because of that, it adds more stress to the employees which certainly affects the service provided to tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKACE honorary advisor Buston Chu said employers should provide workers with flexible arrangements, and also enhance their engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your employees involved. Let them know their purpose and that they are a very important stakeholder to make Hong Kong a place of hospitality. I think this is something the management have to do," Chu said.

 The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association on Tuesday said it has been proactively informing and advising elderly people about an impending cold spell, and has bolstered manpower to support those requiring assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the group's head, Maura Wong, said there has not been a notable uptick in requests for assistance from the elderly lately, adding that a surge in help requests typically occurs approximately three days after a sharp temperature decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong urged senior citizens to prioritise their well-being, cautioning that a significant temperature decrease could greatly affect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, when the temperature drops, we notice several things. The elderly may complain of intensified pain, their blood circulation may not be that good, or they don't exercise or they find they lose their balance and fall, or suffer from dizziness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In more serious cases, they may experience problems with their trachea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Cheng Yuen-chung, an assistant director at the observatory, said on the same programme that temperatures could dip as low as 16 degrees on Wednesday and 15 degrees on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said temperatures in southern China are still within the normal range despite the impact of global warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our preliminary forecast is that the number of cold days this winter will be close to normal. What is considered normal? Generally speaking, the normal range of cold weather days in Hong Kong is 9 to 17 days. Last year, there were 14 cold days, which is within the normal range," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, DP World Tour Championship winner Rory McIlroy, and two-time major winner Xander Schuaffele were named Monday as 2024 PGA Tour Player of the Year award nominees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jack Nicklaus Award, named for the record 18-time major winner, and the Arnold Palmer Award for the PGA Rookie of the Year will be voted upon by PGA Tour members through December 4 with winners announced by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nominees for PGA Rookie of the Year include France's Matthieu Pavon and Americans Nick Dunlap, Jake Knapp and Max Greyserman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler and Schauffele are favorites in the top player race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler won Paris Olympic gold and captured seven titles on the PGA Tour, including his second Masters title in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old American also won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, the Heritage and Memorial tournaments, the Travelers Championship and the season-ending Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the season money leader and took the Byron Nelson Award for low scoring average at 68.645 strokes. He had 16 top-10 PGA finishes without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schauffele captured his first two major titles, winning the PGA Championship and the British Open, and the 31-year-old American was second in scoring average at 69.137. He had 15 top-10 efforts without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy won the Zurich Classic pairs event with Irishman Shane Lowry and his fourth Wells Fargo Championship on the PGA Tour and had 15 top-10s without a missed cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland almost captured his fifth major title and first since 2014 but settled for second at the US Open to Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the rookies, 20-year-old Dunlap was the surprise story. He won the American Express title as an amateur on a sponsor exemption in January, turned professional and then captured the Barracuda Championship, becoming the first player in tour history to win as a pro and amateur in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pavon, 32, won the Farmers Insurance Open and was third at Pebble Beach as well as fifth in the US Open. He was the only rookie to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knapp, 30, won his first PGA title at the Mexico Open while Greyserman, 29, was a three-time runner-up. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The innovation and technology chief on Tuesday expressed confidence in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics, saying these are “immensely promising”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also told a summit on AI and robotics that such technologies not only enhance productivity and service quality, but also offer greater convenience and better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Coupled with the vast market size and population in the Greater Bay Area, the benefits of AI and robotics applications, alongside the associated business opportunities, are immensely promising and substantial,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR offers a “perfect setting” for the technologies to flourish, and that the city is moving towards becoming an international IT centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, organised by the Hong Kong Productivity Council, explores the trends and applications of AI and robotics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egyptian officials said 16 people were missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea on Monday after warnings of rough waters.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red Sea Governor Amr Hanafi said preliminary reports suggested a sudden large wave struck the boat, capsizing it within five to seven minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some passengers were in their cabins, which is why they were unable to escape," he added in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanafi said rescuers saved 28 people from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the Red Sea Governorate said the 28 had only minor injuries, such as bruises and scrapes, with none requiring hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governorate said a distress call was received just before dawn from the boat, which had departed from Porto Ghalib in Marsa Alam on Sunday with plans to return to Hurghada Marina on November 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 44 people were onboard the yacht, including 13 Egyptians, who include crew members, and 31 foreign nationals from the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, China, Slovakia, Spain, and Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Embassy in Egypt said two Chinese tourists were rescued by other vessels passing through the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy has contacted both tourists, who are said to be in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the second boat to sink in the area this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a boat sank after it suffered severe damage from strong waves. No casualties were reported in that incident. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of protesters calling for the release of Pakistan's jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan defied roadblocks and tear gas to march to the gates of the nation's capital on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said one police officer was killed and nine were critically wounded in two days of clashes with demonstrators as they closed in on Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan was barred from standing in February elections that were marred by allegations of rigging.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sidelined by dozens of legal cases which he claimed were fabricated to prevent his comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular demonstrations, aiming to seize public spaces in Islamabad and other large cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital has been locked down since late Saturday, with mobile internet sporadically cut and more than 20,000 police flooding the streets, many armed with riot shields and batons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the Islamabad city administration announced a two-month ban on public gatherings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But PTI convoys travelled from their power base in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the most populous eastern province of Punjab, hauling aside roadblocks of stacked shipping containers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the early hours of Tuesday, protesters were clashing with police who were firing tear gas and rubber bullets at a motorway entry to Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  PTI's chief demand is the release of Khan, the 72-year-old charismatic former cricket star who served as premier from 2018 to 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been jailed since August 2023, facing legal accusations ranging from illegal marriage to graft and inciting riots. (AFP)

    China 'open to dialogue' after Trump tariff threat

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it remains "open to dialogue" with the United States after president-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, after being asked whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US said "no one will win a trade war" after Trump said he intends to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman said in an email to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a series of posts to his Truth Social account on Monday, Trump vowed to hit some of Washington's largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another post, Trump said he would be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canberra, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said on Tuesday that the US policy on trade with China and other countries would have an impact on relations between China and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "US policy on trade with China, with other countries as well, will have an impact and that is an important element that we have to consider," Xiao told a press conference in Canberra, in response to a question on whether potential tariffs by Trump would impact China and Australia's bilateral relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada described its trade relationship with the US "mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration," said a statement from Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favourable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. (Agencies)

    West Ham stun Newcastle to ease pressure on Lopetegui

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham produced a clinical away performance to beat resurgent Newcastle 2-0 on Monday, easing the pressure on beleaguered manager Julen Lopetegui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek headed the visitors in front against the run of play at St James' Park and Aaron Wan-Bissaka grabbed a rare goal in the second half to double the Hammers' lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle were unable to capitalise on the chances they created, failing to build on the momentum created by recent wins against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result, only West Ham's second win on the road this season, lifts them to 15 points, just three behind 10th-placed Newcastle, who missed out on the chance to move into the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made the early running and in-form forward Alexander Isak had the ball in the net in the fifth minute after a delicate dink over Lukasz Fabianski, only for it to be ruled out for offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham, expected to face a tough test on Newcastle's home turf, showed little adventure in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their first real foray up the pitch resulted in a corner and the unmarked Soucek powered home a header from close range in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle enjoyed the bulk of the possession as a lively first half unfolded but West Ham were robust in defence and threatened when they went forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon had a glorious chance to level after a poor clearance from Jean-Clair Todibo but fired straight at Fabianski.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes later Isak chested down a superb cross from Bruno Guimarães but steered narrowly wide on the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's Newcastle were again on the front foot at the start of the second half but it was West Ham who doubled their lead through Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United man scored his first goal for West Ham and just his third career goal after picking up Jarrod Bowen's pass and firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe brought on Jacob Murphy and Callum Wilson in a bid to turn the tide but Newcastle failed to build up a head of steam against their determined opponents, who saw out the game with relative ease. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 American car manufacturer Cadillac will become the eleventh team on the Formula One grid in 2026, after the sport's owners announced Monday they had given their backing to the plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Formula 1 said it had reached "an agreement in principle" with General Motors (GM), which owns Cadillac, to support bringing a team into the paddock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Formula 1 has maintained a dialogue with General Motors, and its partners at TWG Global, regarding the viability of an entry following the commercial assessment and decision made by Formula 1 in January 2024," Formula One said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time," Formula One said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cars are expected to be powered by Ferrari before it develops its own engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Formula 1 rejected the bid which was headed up by Andretti – owned by Michael Andretti, son of 1978 world champion Mario Andretti – earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly a fortnight ago, GM announced it had registered with the FIA to become a Formula One engine manufacturer from 2028, offering support to Andretti's bid to join the F1 grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Andretti name has since been dropped from the proposal with Michael no longer involved, although Mario is understood to be taking on an ambassadorial role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an honour for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world's premier racing series, and we're committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world," said GM president Mark Reuss.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US has become an increasingly important stop on the F1 tour. This announcement comes less than 48 hours after the Las Vegas Grand Prix which, after Miami and Austin, is the third US race on the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netflix series 'Drive to Survive' has also boosted the sport's profile in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who had been in favour of the original Andretti bid, said he was "fully supportive" of the arrival of the GM/Cadillac team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All parties, including the FIA, will continue to work together to ensure the process progresses smoothly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefano Domenicali, the president and CEO of Formula 1, described the news as "an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this entry, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved," he said. (AFP)

    Ronaldo leads Al Nassr to brink of AFC quarter-finals

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice for Al Nassr as they continued to thrive in the AFC Champions League Elite, with the Saudi champions defeating Al Gharafa 3-1 in Qatar on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old's contributions moved Al Nassr nearer to the last eight, needing just two points from their final three group games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only Al Shorta on two points, with four games to play, can deny Ronaldo's side a place in the next round, after Persepolis drew 1-1 at Al Rayyan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr captain Ronaldo had looked destined to endure a hugely frustrating game following a series of missed opportunities in the first half at Al Bayt Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Portugal star finally opened the scoring little more than 50 seconds into the second half, when he headed home Sultan Al Ghannam's cross from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr then doubled their advantage through Angelo Gabriel, a summer signing from Chelsea, on 58 minutes, before the Brazilian turned provider six minutes later to tee up Ronaldo for his second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal took the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward to four goals in this season's rebranded competition before he was replaced on 74 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Gharafa did pull one back through Joselu, a former team-mate of Ronaldo at Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet their hopes of an unlikely late rally disappeared when Seydou Sano was sent off six minutes from the end of normal time for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win ensures Al Nassr remain unbeaten through five matches in the Western side of the draw, and move second in the 12-team table. (AFP)

    Australia's most decorated Olympian McKeon retires

<img alt="McKeon on the podium after the final of the women's 50m freestyle at Tokyo 2020. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780806_1_20241126070625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Emma McKeon, Australia's most decorated Olympian and an eight-time world-record holder, retired from the sport on Monday aged 30.
 <br>
  <br>
  McKeon won 14 Olympic medals, six of them gold, over the Rio, Tokyo and Paris Games this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I am officially retiring from competitive swimming," she said on Instagram, along with a collage of clips showcasing her many career highlights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Leading into Paris I knew it would be my last Olympics and the months since have given me time to reflect on my journey and think about what I wanted my future to look like in swimming," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021 that McKeon really made her name, winning an unsurpassed seven medals to join the all-time swimming greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her four gold and three bronze bettered the six won by East German Kristin Otto in 1988 and American Natalie Coughlin in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also matched the record for most decorated woman athlete at a single Games, tied with Russian gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya in 1952.
  <br>
  <br>
  A versatile and tenacious freestyle and butterfly racer, her career looked in jeopardy after failing to qualify for the London 2012 Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, she went on to become her country's most honoured Olympian -- a field with plenty of competition given Australia's swimming prowess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am proud of myself for giving my swimming career absolutely everything, both physically and mentally," she said on Monday. "I wanted to see what I was capable of – and I did."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Wollongong in New South Wales, McKeon, whose excellence was matched by her humility, had heritage in the pool with her father Ron swimming at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKeon's mother Susie swam at the 1982 Commonwealth Games while her brother David competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, with Emma and David becoming the first brother and sister to swim for Australia at the same Games in 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She was and will continue to be a great role model for younger athletes," said Australian swim team head coach Rohan Taylor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She always carried herself with dignity and while we all saw her grace the public can not truly appreciate how tough she is," she added. (AFP)

    US markets climb as Treasury Secretary named

<img alt="Wall Street indices hit new highs as investors welcomed the incoming Trump Administration's choice for treasury secretary. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780799_1_20241126053432.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow finished at a second straight record on Monday, opening a holiday-shortened week with a flourish as investors applauded President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices climbed on news of the selection of hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to lead the critical economic policy position.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the indices, climbing one percent to finish at an all-time high of 44,736.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent to 5,987.37, and the Nasdaq Composite Index also gained 0.3 percent to 19,054.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market "breathed a sigh of relief" at Bessent's selection, said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after an initial surge, the gains in equities moderated somewhat. While investors are enthusiastic about the possibility of tax cuts and regulatory relief under Trump, "we do have to face the potential for tariffs being a negative as well as a very tight market around immigration, which is not positive for the economy," Hogan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, markets are looking ahead to a fairly heavy couple of days of earnings and economic news before Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The calendar includes Wednesday's reading on personal consumption pricing, a key inflation benchmark affecting the upcoming monetary policy decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Macy's fell 2.3 percent as it reported preliminary results that included a 2.4 percent drop in sales to US$4.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department store delayed the release of full earnings after a forensic investigation found an employee hid up to US$154 million in delivery expenses starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 through early November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bath & Body Works surged 16.5 percent after the retailer raised its full-year projections following quarterly earnings that exceeded its forecast. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Ireland rugby international Brendan Mullin was on Monday sentenced to three years in prison, after being found guilty of stealing more than 500,000 euros (nearly US$525 million) from a bank.
 <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Dublin earlier this month found Mullin, 61, guilty of 12 out of 14 charges, which ranged from theft, deception and furnishing false information to the bank authorising invoice payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offences took place between 2011 and 2013 when he was chief executive of Bank of Ireland Private Bank in the Irish capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mullin won 55 caps for Ireland between 1984 and 1995, scoring 17 tries, and also played at three World Cups in 1987, 1991 and 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Martin Nolan said Mullin offered no motive for his actions but could only infer that he was "somewhat desperate for funds and embarked on this endeavour to obtain money", national broadcaster RTE reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, he said he took into account that the bank was repaid in full and not at a loss, and that Mullin had shown remorse. But he said a custodial sentence was inevitable. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office on Monday urged Hong Kong and Guangdong to work together to bring positive developments for the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Deepening Economic, Trade and Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, Zheng Yanxiong said Hong Kong's economy and society have seen improvements with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the SAR and Guangdong could lead the GBA on the development of innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Guangdong and Hong Kong can make good use of the advantages of the innovation and industrial chains of the GBA, focusing on emerging fields like artificial intelligence, life sciences, low-altitude economy and green development," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two places should accelerate the cultivation and creation of new industries, and develop new quality productive forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming said the GBA has unlimited prospects, with the size of the economy reaching over 10 trillion yuan last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can improve together with Guangdong, making use of different advantages, with Hong Kong serving as a super-connector and a super value-adder, and helping Guangdong and Hong Kong go global together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who is leading a delegation of government officials and business leaders on a visit to the GBA, also attended the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong and Guangdong reached agreement on 126 economic and trade cooperation projects totalling more than 100 billion yuan at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of these projects, 101 involve Hong Kong businesses investing in Guangdong, with a total value exceeding 91 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They cover areas like financial cooperation, modern logistics, smart productions, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the love for the country and family as well as practical actions by Hong Kong entrepreneurs in actively serving the development of Guangdong and the mainland," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation arrived in Foshan on Monday night on the next leg of their visit. Lee will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, with Chief Secretary Eric Chan continuing to lead the delegation that will also visit Dongguan, Huizhou and Shenzhen.

    Former king Juan Carlos sued for alleged tax offences

<img alt="Juan Carlos, 86, went into self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates in 2020. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780780_1_20241125215556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's disgraced former king Juan Carlos is being sued for alleged tax offences by a group of retired judges, one of the complainants said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish prosecutors in March 2022 closed three probes into his finances due to insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations, but said several irregularities had been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them were lucrative gifts from Gulf Arab monarchies and private trips funded by a foundation based in the tiny European state of Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  The complainants say a court rather than public prosecutors must decide if Juan Carlos fulfilled his tax obligations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos, 86, has made two payments worth more than five million euros to the Spanish tax authorities to settle money owed on undeclared income, widely viewed as a bid to avoid charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  His regularisation of income declarations from 2014 to 2018 "were not done in accordance with the law", former Spanish Supreme Court judge Jose Antonio Martin Pallin told public broadcaster TVE.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not have the slightest interest in prison sentences being applied," but the harshest possible fine should be imposed, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, philosophers and journalists were also among the complainants, Pallin said, without specifying their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juan Carlos enjoyed widespread admiration for his role in Spain's transition to democracy following the death of longtime dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the revelations about the murky origins of his fortune since his abdication in 2014 have done irreparable damage to his reputation and harmed the Spanish monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went into self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates in 2020. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports are legitimate trade remedies fully in line with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said in a statement: "By requesting consultations with China over its provisional anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, the Commission is following through on its commitment to protect our industry from unfounded accusations and misuse of trade defence measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to a media query on the consultation request filed by the EU over these measures through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, a Commerce Ministry official said the Chinese side will handle it in accordance with the WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Beijing to impose anti-dumping measures last month came after the EU slapped additional import tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. China has filed its own complaint with the WTO over the new tariffs on electric vehicles. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it hopes Japan will work towards improving people exchanges between the two countries, after Beijing announced a visa-free arrangement for Japanese citizens last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We certainly hope that the Japanese side will join us... to enhance the level of facilitation of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a regular briefing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the facilitation of people-to-people exchanges."
  <br>
  <br>
  China will expand its visa-free arrangements to include Japan and eight other countries, including Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, from November 30, 2024, to December 31, 2025, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's part of ongoing efforts to boost international tourism and business travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will also extend the visa-free stay period to 30 days from 15 days for citizens of all 38 countries within its visa-free programme. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they plan to start using drones in around a year's time to check safety issues at construction sites.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first half of this year, there were 11 fatal industrial accidents, two more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said they will use drones for taking photos from the air and will then use the pictures to generate 3D models to help with law enforcement and evidence collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the advantage of being able to fly, [the drones] can collect evidence and take photos for us," an assistant labour commissioner, Wan Chi-ping, told lawmakers at a manpower panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're now working along this line to see how we can help our staff in patrolling and inspecting various sites in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan said officials are now buying the drones needed, and some 20 members of staff are being trained to control them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said they will look at eliminating risky work tasks or lowering workers' exposure to such activities by helping the sector use technology to improve occupational safety and health.

    HK will continue to help GBA companies go global: FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in helping companies in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) go global.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Listed Companies Summit, Chan described the GBA as a developed economy, and said companies in the area are vital for the country's opening-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR, as an international financial centre, can help create more opportunities and add value for GBA companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the geopolitical haze, mainland companies are facing unprecedented challenges when they raise funds in the Western markets. Hong Kong will reform the financial market in response to the situation to gather more domestic and overseas funds to support projects and companies in the GBA," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as they are beneficial to companies, the development of Hong Kong's financial market, and the development of the country, we will actively study and push forward the policies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi Bin, deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, said there are 5,000 listed companies in the GBA, and they help promote cooperation in areas like finance, economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope listed companies in the GBA could actively make use of Hong Kong's advantages, and treat the city as a base for overseas expansion. While consolidating the American and Western markets, we should work together and expand into emerging markets like the Asean, Middle East and Latin America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee, meanwhile thanked the country for supporting the city's development as an international financial centre, international aviation hub and offshore renminbi hub.

    DHL cargo plane crashes in Lithuania

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A DHL cargo plane crashed as it came in to land at Lithuania's Vilnius airport early on Monday morning, killing one person on the aircraft and with some debris damaging a house.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three other people onboard were injured but no one on the ground was hurt, officials said. Flames and smoke engulfed the crashed plane as fire crews worked to extinguish the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheduled flight was operated by airline Swiftair on behalf of DHL and had taken off from Leipzig, Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the crash was not immediately known and officials said there was no indication so far that it might be a case of sabotage, although Germany is investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig for delivery by DHL earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian counter-intelligence chief Darius Jauniskis told reporters: "We cannot reject the possibility of terrorism...but at the moment we can't make attributions or point fingers, because we don't have such information."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-400 crashed around 0330 GMT while approaching Vilnius airport for landing, a spokesperson for Lithuania's National Crisis Management Centre said. The flight had departed from Leipzig at 0208 GMT, Flightradar24 said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security camera footage showed an aircraft descending behind a warehouse after which the night sky was lit up in bright red and orange colours followed by plumes of thick dark smoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue services said the plane hit the ground, split into pieces and slid over 100 metres. Some debris hit a house.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the recording of the conversation between the pilots and the tower, the pilots, until the very last second did not tell the tower of any extraordinary event," said Marius Baranauskas, head of the Lithuanian National Aviation Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to examine the black boxes to know what was happening in the aircraft," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian police and prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the incident, and a specialised unit in the Justice Ministry will carry out a civil aviation incident probe, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only these investigations will answer questions on the real reasons of the incident, speculations and guesses will really not help to determine the truth", Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lithuanian police spokesperson said one person onboard, a Spanish citizen, was killed and three others - Spanish, German and Lithuanian citizens - were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told a press conference 12 people had been evacuated from the house hit by debris. There were no casualties on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters poured water onto the smoking building some 1.3 km north of the airport runway and nearby streets were cordoned off.
  <br>
  <br>
  DHL has launched its own investigation into the crash, a spokesperson for the company's Lithuanian arm told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The aircraft contained regular parcels. We do not have any information that any of them were suspicious," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Union Aviation Safety Agency spokesperson said it was too early to comment on the causes of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 737-400 aircraft involved in the accident was 31 years old, according to a Flightradar24 database. Boeing was working to gather more information and would provide any support, a Boeing spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiftair declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  German security authorities are also investigating the crash and are in close contact with domestic and foreign authorities, a security source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany is already investigating several fires caused by incendiary devices hidden inside parcels at a warehouse in Leipzig earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  British police are investigating a warehouse fire in Birmingham in July, caused by a package catching alight, and liaising with other European law enforcement agencies to see if there was a connection with similar incidents elsewhere.
  <br>
