<img alt="US Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukraine's president in Munich where the pair will discuss Washington's efforts to end the conflict between Kyiv and Moscow. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791648_1_20250214165245.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance will lead America's delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict .
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for talks that many — particularly in Europe — hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join them but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who upended years of steadfast US support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Ukraine war has to end,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in Munich to communicate Beijing's position on global security.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, state media cited Wang as saying China welcomes all efforts committed to peace talks and supports building a "balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture." (Agencies)

    Govt backs CUHK Medical Centre loan extension bid

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has backed a request by CUHK Medical Centre to extend a loan repayment period, saying it doesn't want to end up having to take back the hospital's site due to a default.
 <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, legislators agreed to a two-year extension to repayments of a HK$4 billion government loan, in view of financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical centre is now seeking another extension, of three years, saying it expects to make losses in the current financial year as well as in the next one, and its cash balance is insufficient to cover the repayments at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on Friday, some lawmakers expressed concern that by 2028, the Chinese University would still be struggling to pay off the loan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What will the hospital do to tackle such a big funding gap? I'm sure no one wants the hospital to come back to Legco for another repayment extension after three years," said DAB lawmaker Chan Wing-kwong, with the party's Starry Lee echoing his concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the university's council, John Chai, told legislators that the medical centre will cut costs and find ways to boost revenue, for example by introducing more in-patient beds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a pocket of measures, including strengthening the business model through governance, through better management of the operations, looking into means of increasing avenues of revenue, looking into resource efficiency," Chai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said if Legco doesn't approve the new extension before the middle of next month, CUHK will have to start repaying a first instalment of over HK$550 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the medical centre fails to repay the loan, it is clearly stipulated in the contract that there will be an additional interest rate of three percent per annum," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it still fails to repay the loan in the worst case scenario, the government will take back the medical centre, including the site and all the buildings or structures. We don't want to see this situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension request will be submitted to Legco's Finance Committee for further discussion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were killed and more than two dozen were injured when a blaze ripped through a hotel construction site in the South Korean port city of Busan on Friday, the National Fire Agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire started just before 11am local time at the construction site of the Banyan Tree Hotel, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 workers were present when the blaze erupted, a National Fire Agency official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-five people were injured, a public health department official said, adding that most were minor injuries caused by smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire had already reached its peak by the time we arrived and thick black smoke was covering the scene," Busan Gijang Fire Station chief Hong Mun-sik told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were many flammable materials blocking the entrance," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out on the first floor of the building where workers had stored insulation materials, Hong said, and the fatalities occurred where the fire started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The exact cause and location of the fire need to be thoroughly investigated," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire was brought under control around 1.30pm. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of a pop-culture festival in the city on Friday said they were offering a refund to people who bought faulty priority tickets this week for the event next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mishap had to do with the popular K-pop girl group, NJZ, formerly known as New Jeans, who will be performing on March 23, the last day of the three-day festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  But fans were left disappointed when the tickets they bought through Cityline had the wrong date printed.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it was now refunding ticket holders who filed complaints with the Consumer Council, or made formal enquiries with ComplexCon or Cityline on or before Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To apply for the refund, please send the valid ticket and the confirmation email from Cityline, using the e-mail account you used to purchase the tickets, to ticketing_support_0210@complexconhk.com by 5pm Hong Kong time on [Sunday]," it said in a statement posted on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the refund would not include handling fees charged by Cityline, and they were working with the platform on more details as to when the payment would go through.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it reserves the right to have the final say if there are any objections and disputes over the refund arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Consumer Council said it had received more than 50 complaints over the matter, involving some HK$220,000.

    'More schools should join free HPV jabs scheme'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers are calling for more secondary schools to get involved in the government's HPV vaccine catch-up programme, saying the current participation rate was not ideal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health has purchased 180,000 HPV jabs for 52,000 female students to take two doses for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only 3,700 students were inoculated as 34 percent of schools have refused or have yet to sign up to the scheme that was rolled out last year, blaming manpower problems or scheduling issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr David Lam from the medical sector said two doses of the HPV vaccine could offer lifelong protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 9-valent HPV vaccine that we have right now can cover most of the viruses causing cervical cancer. It can prevent the infection caused by these viruses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means it has very wide coverage. Apart from this, it's also very safe. Medical evidence has shown that its effectiveness can reach 90 percent or more."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that side effects, such as headaches and nausea, are mild.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elizabeth Quat from the DAB urged the government to step up promotion of the vaccine, saying that many parents were unaware of the free programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  It costs at least HK$3,000 for two HPV jabs in the private sector, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of cervical cancer cases in Hong Kong has surged by almost 30 percent in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the disease was the ninth deadliest cancer in the region.

 Arrangements were being made by the Macau authorities – via the Red Cross – to return to the SAR the bodies of two residents killed in an explosion in Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair were among seven members of a family from Macau caught up in the blast that rocked the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected gas explosion hit the food court on the 12th floor of the building, killing four and injuring about 30 others.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of officials from Macau went to Taichung and visited those injured in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  China on Friday expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, also extended sympathy to those injured in the blast. (Agencies)

    Tragedy prompts calls for database of at-risk families

 The government should set up a database of at-risk elderly people, a lawmaker said on Friday, a day after a man in his 70s was found dead with his son unharmed beside him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police were alerted on Thursday when security personnel detected a foul odour coming from a flat at Butterfly Estate in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers discovered the body of the 78-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 44-year-old son, who is reportedly mentally challenged, was next to the elder.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, lawmaker Bill Tang said authorities should consolidate the data they have about the city's senior citizens, noting that government units like the Social Welfare Department and the Hospital Authority hold the majority of information about these individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government can and has to integrate such database and form a high-risk elderly and family database, and facilitate the different kinds of social service organisations and community organisations... to care [for] and reach such kind of high-risk families," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  One way to check up on such households would be to install sensors on devices around the flat, Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the sensor would be triggered and send an alert if the home's gate, for example, has not been touched for 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow legislator Stanley Li said the tragedy highlighted the need to shore up support for carers, adding the administration should offer more training for people to become caretakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department expressed concern about the incident, saying it has arranged for social workers to contact the family and provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the family involved was not a case under the department.

<img alt="Monica Lee-Müller says the convention and exhibition centre will host more finance and technology-related events this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exhibition activities fully returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with the number of visitors to the Convention and Exhibition Centre topping eight million, up 35 percent year-on-year, according to the centre's operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monica Lee-Müller, managing director at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited, said the centre hosted 812 events in 2024, including 100 international exhibitions and conferences.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it will host more large-scale finance and technology-related events this year to assist with the SAR's fintech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes Consensus Hong Kong 2025 on February 18-20, when more than 8,000 bitcoin, blockchain and Web3 professionals are expected to gather and discuss industry trends, before another conference in August specifically featuring bitcoins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the hospitality sector veteran said the centre has been rolling out more measures, such as setting up Muslim-friendly facilities, to cater to the demands of diverse international visitors, especially those from the Middle East and Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the highlights of last year, she said, was the beauty event Cosmopack Asia 2024, when 74 percent of over 60,000 participants were from overseas, and the number of Middle East exhibitors rose 40 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visitors for consumption-related events also rose to a new record over the past 12 months, with sales during Pet Show 2025 last week exceeding HK$100 million, the highest among such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee-Müller said the centre will innovate and host a new event, International Food Tasting Festival 2025, in April to further boost consumption, adding that over 600 exhibitors have already signed up.

    Tougher jail terms introduced for space oil offences
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Friday added four substances to its list of dangerous drugs, a move which significantly increases the maximum punishments for people caught consuming, possessing, trafficking or manufacturing space oil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Users and those found with the space oil drug now risk prison terms of up to seven years and a fine as high as HK$1 million, while manufacturers or traffickers of any of the substances involved – etomidate, metomidate, propoxate and isopropoxate – can be jailed for life and hit with HK$5 million in fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, the maximum prison term for space oil, under prescription drug regulations, was two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Narcotics Kesson Lee said the tougher penalties will be a bigger deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By listing the substances as dangerous drugs, we give greater powers to law enforcement agencies," Lee said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers can seize the proceeds of drug traffickers after applying to the courts. And if the traffickers had used young people for trafficking, we can also demand the court to pass heavier sentences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Community Drug Advisory Council said the increased penalties are helpful, but they won't completely stop people from supplying or using space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will still be people taking risks for drug trafficking, and some will continue taking the drug," the council's executive director, David Ng, said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, space oil has been popular among young people for over two years in Hong Kong. Right now, we can say the drug has taken root here. Information on how to buy and consume it is all over many circles among youngsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng called for different levels of intervention with young people, including new measures targeting those who smoke e-cigarettes, as these can be used to take the drug.

    Baidu to make latest Ernie AI model open-source

<img alt="Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791606_1_20250214121337.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Search engine giant Baidu said on Friday it would make its next-generation artificial intelligence model Ernie open-source from June 30, a major shift in strategy as competition heats up.
 <br>
  <br>
  Baidu CEO Robin Li had long advocated for closed-source models as the only viable path for AI development, but the advent of DeepSeek has upended the sector. The startup offers open-source AI services that it claims are comparable in performance to US pioneer OpenAI's advanced systems but come with a lower operational cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keen to increase market share, Baidu also announced on Thursday that it would make its AI chatbot Ernie Bot free starting April 1, about a year and a half after introducing premium versions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, its Ernie large language model has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Baidu has said its current version, Ernie 4.0, matches OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance's Doubao chatbot has the most active monthly users on the mainland with 78.6 million, DeepSeek has 33.7 million while Ernie Bot has 13 million, according to January data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will gradually launch the Ernie 4.5 series in the coming months and officially open-source it from June 30," Baidu said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li appeared to have changed tack on open-source development, telling attendees at an event in Dubai this week that it could accelerate AI adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you open things up, a lot of people will be curious enough to try it. This will help spread the technology much faster," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu also plans to launch a new next-generation model, Ernie 5, in the second half of 2025, a person familiar with the matter has said. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China's men's curlers on Friday fell short of a podium finish at the Asian Winter Games, as the national team secured their 25th bronze and 83rd medal overall in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team China were dominant from the onset, jumping out to a 3-0 advantage over the SAR squad before entering the second end of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap managed to put two points on the board through the fourth end, but the national team cruised to hold a comfortable 5-2 lead entering the fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team China went on to secure another five before eventually sealing a 10-3 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong earlier beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to qualify for a spot in the final four.

    Trump signs plan for reciprocal tariffs on US partners

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump inked plans on Thursday for sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often "worse than our enemies" on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’ve decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff," Trump said at the proclamation signing. “It’s fair to all. No other country can complain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, he called the European Union "absolutely brutal" in trade ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the memo Trump signed on Thursday, officials - including the US trade representative and commerce secretary - will propose remedies on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said that studies should be completed by April 1, and the president could start tariffs as early as April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the EU, the White House also flagged differences in certain US tariff levels with India and Brazil, while noting Japan's "high structural barriers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists caution that sweeping tariffs on US imports would likely boost inflation, not reduce it, in the near term and could weigh on growth eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged on Thursday that US prices "could go up" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease. (Agencies)

    Modi, Trump agree to trade talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine," but nonetheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi's country “very unfair and strong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the US erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing US energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and India have a trade deficit of US$50 billion in India’s favour. Goods and services trade between the two countries totalled around US$190.1 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, US exports to India were worth nearly US$70 billion, and imports US$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, the fourth world leader to visit the White House since Trump's return, described him as a friend and told him he was adopting a take on his "Make America Great Again" slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining Trump's meeting with Modi was SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. Modi also met one-on-one with Musk, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian premier posted pictures of himself shaking hands with the beaming Musk, with several children on Musk's side of the room, and Indian officials on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, a prolific user of Musk-owned social media platform X, said later that he had known Musk before he became prime minister. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defence budgets in half.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hoped to gain commitments from Russia and China to cut their own spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully much more productive," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.” (Agencies)

    Vaccine critic RFK Jr sworn in as US health secretary

<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named US Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Kennedy was sworn into the post, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to "Make America Healthy Again," that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around "radical transparency" and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump," Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programmes in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will now run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that directs more than US$3 trillion in healthcare spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the US drugs regulator and industry. (Reuters)

    Foreign Minister Wang Yi in UK for talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Britain need to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual trust and demonstrate responsibility as major countries, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a meeting with the UK prime minister on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang is visiting London for a strategic dialogue with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at which both sides agreed to speed up preparations for institutional dialogues on the economy and trade, health and industrial cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lammy hosted talks with Wang as the pair revived the China-UK Strategic Dialogue, a bilateral forum that was last held in 2018 before it stalled as relations soured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "dropped in" to a meeting between Wang and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "underlined his intention to build a consistent and respectful relationship between the UK and China" and "reiterated that the UK will always engage frankly on the areas where our views differ," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukraine crisis, with Wang stressing "no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said China welcomed efforts committed to peace talks and supported the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour government, elected in July, has sought to improve the UK's relationship with Beijing after the two countries fell out during the latter years of Conservative rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major thawing of tensions, Starmer and President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit last November - the first bilateral meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance minister Rachel Reeves then visited China last month seeking investment to kickstart growth in Britain's economy, while Lammy visited Beijing in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge humpback whale briefly scooped a kayaker in its mouth in the seas off the coast of southern Chile before spitting him out unscathed in a dramatic incident caught on camera.
 <br>
  <br>
  The kayaker, Adrian Simancas, was out with his father last weekend in the seas off the town of Punta Arenas, when the whale surfaced and scooped him up in his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt like I was being lifted, but it was clearly too strong to be a wave," said Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I turned, I felt something blue and white passing close to my face, like on one side and above. I didn't understand what was happening. Then everything... I went under and thought I had been swallowed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Luckily, the whale quickly spat out Simancas unharmed. His father, in another kayak, caught the whole thing on camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I turned on the camera and heard a wave crash behind me, loudly. When I turned, I didn't see anything," said his father, Dell Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that was the only moment of real fear because I didn't see Adrian for about three seconds. Then he suddenly shot out without the packraft, and a second later, the packraft emerged, and then I saw the fin of something."
  <br>
  <br>
  Adrian Simancas was sure he was going to die during the ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I was done for, that I was dead. It was like three strange seconds down there," he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won 3-0 at home to Anderlecht in the first leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off tie, while Real Sociedad triumphed 2-1 away to Midtjylland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Premier League duo Dusan Tadic and Edin Dzeko scored in the first half for Fenerbahce before Morocco international Youssef En-Nesyri headed in a third for the Turkish side to give them full control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho won the competition with Porto in 2003 and again with Manchester United in 2017, also reaching the final when he was in charge of Roma two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad will return to Spain in a commanding position after a penalty from Brais Mendez and terrific goal by Japan winger Takefusa Kubo saw them past Danish Midtjylland, who pulled one back through Adam Buksa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the tie will play United or Tottenham in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ajax took charge of their play-off against Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise with a 2-0 victory in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Rasmussen steered the Dutch club ahead just before the hour, with 16-year-old Jorthy Mokio volleying in a second from 20 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's Mohammad Abu Fani struck the only goal in Budapest as Ferencvaros won 1-0 against Viktoria Plzen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time former winners Porto host Roma later on Thursday, while Galatasaray are away to AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in the Conference League, Irish side Shamrock Rovers secured a 1-0 win away to Norwegians Molde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Molde defender Valdemar Lund was sent off before half-time for a challenge on Michael Noonan, who netted the winner in the second half to become the competition's youngest scorer at 16 years and 197 days old.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended higher on Thursday, powered by gains in tech related stocks, with the S&P 500 leading the charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia, Apple and Tesla all rose after President Trump unveiled a roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said the tariffs would match the higher duties charged by other countries and could be imposed within weeks as Trump's trade and economic team studies bilateral tariff and trade relationships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also gained after data showed US producer prices increased in January, while key elements in the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a measure closely tracked by the US Federal Reserve, were benign or lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.04 percent to end at 6,115.07. It was the S&P 500's largest one-day gain since January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq gained 1.50 percent to 19,945.64, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent to 44,711.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla jumped 5.9 percent, Nvidia climbed 3.2 percent and Apple rose 2 percent, lifting the S&P 500 to just short of its record high close on January 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity investors are taking cues from the bond market," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. "Investors were also preparing for kind of an alarmingly high inflation number, based on tariffs." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda lovers wishing to catch a glimpse of Ocean Park's new twin cubs can opt for a VIP session each day, with registration for the private visit opening on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, the first pandas to be born in Hong Kong, will make their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the public could meet the twins from 10am to 3pm every day, with the facility expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people could also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day. The first visit will be on February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each session will start at around 9.30am and can accommodate up to 40 people, Pong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ticket holders can get early admission and have a dedicated session to meet the pandas. Each visitor will have to pay 1,500 dollars. After deducting costs, the revenue will be used for the park's giant panda conservation work," Pong told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the sake of animal welfare, there will not be any activities for people to interact with or hold the giant pandas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair of panda cubs might not appear at the same time to meet the public because they are still young, Pong added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 German authorities said a driver drove a car into a labour union demonstration in central Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people including children.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said it was believed to be an attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, an Afghan asylum-seeker, was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germany’s February 23 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said on social media platform X that the driver was “secured” and no longer posed any danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said participants in a demonstration by the service workers’ union ver.di were walking along a street at about 10.30am when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because of the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, which opens on Friday. (AP)

    Shenzhen Bay Port to close for cross-border marathon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

    China steel warns of 'adverse impact' of US tariffs

<img alt="China's Iron and Steel Association said the tariff rise on steel and aluminum imports to the US would adversely impact the supply chain of the global steel industry. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791504_1_20250213181713.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group representing China's steel industry has warned that a new 25 percent tariff on imports of the product into the United States would have an "adverse impact" on the sector, state media reported on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism," the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, the impact on (China's) steel exports is limited," the CISA said in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing (China's) steel export competitiveness," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being the world's top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with demand slumping in the domestic construction sector, Chinese steel exports have surged, spurring concerns in Washington about overcapacity in foreign markets with harmful effects on US producers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a medium- and long-term perspective, the (US) increase in tariffs will have an adverse impact on industrial and supply chains in the global steel industry, including the Chinese steel industry," CISA deputy secretary-general Zhang Longqiang said, according to CCTV. (AFP)

    'Europe must be involved in Ukraine peace talks'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Several Nato allies stressed on Thursday that Ukraine and Europe must not be cut out of any peace negotiations, after US President Donald Trump signalled that he would hold talks soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  “Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” British Defence Secretary John Healey said after the United States rattled Nato by saying that Ukraine should never join the alliance and that European allies should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine’s voice must be at the heart of any talks,” Healey told reporters at Nato's headquarters, as the organisation’s 32 defence ministers met for talks on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson said European nations provided about 60 percent of the military support to Ukraine last year and must be involved, especially given US demands that Europe take more responsibility for Ukraine's security in the longer term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s very natural that we’re engaged into the discussions,” Jonson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Estonian counterpart, Hanno Pevkur, underlined that the European Union has driven sanctions against Russia, has invested heavily in Ukraine’s defence, and will be asked to foot the bill for rebuilding the war-ravaged country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to be there. So there is no question about it. Otherwise this peace will not be long lasting,” Pevkur warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Ukraine’s Western backers on Wednesday that Nato membership for Ukraine was unrealistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  After talks with Putin and then Zelenskyy, Trump said on Wednesday he would “probably” meet in person with the Russian leader soon, and suggested that the meeting could happen in Saudi Arabia. (AP)

<img alt="The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute makes the announcement on social media. Photo courtesy of the HKPORI" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791461_1_20250213143116.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A polling body has announced it will suspend all self-funded research activities and surveys indefinitely and focus on existing commissioned studies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) also said it will change its business model or shut down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its president and CEO Robert Chung said he welcomes interested parties to take over the institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI has always been law-abiding, but in the current environment, it has to pause its promotion of scientific polling. The research team hopes there will be another opportunity to resume its work," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKPORI is actively exploring all possible options, (and) it will announce its final decision when the time is right."
  <br>
  <br>
  Former HKPORI deputy executive director Chung Kim-wah is wanted by the police for alleged national security violations, and Robert Chung was earlier questioned by officers in their investigation into whether he or the institute had provided assistance to an absconder.

<img alt="The SAR's men's team coach Carey Durant says the city will reach greater heights in international competition. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791470_2_20250213153829.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan on Thursday confirmed they had scrapped merger talks announced in December, bringing an end to a tie-up that would have created the world's third-largest automaker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firms said in a joint statement that they "agreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firms' intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla and Chinese firms in the electric vehicle market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda's CEO insisted in December that it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports have said the discussions unravelled after Honda proposed to make its struggling rival a subsidiary instead of the plan, announced in December, to integrate under a new holding company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda "proposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding company... to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchange".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of these discussions, both companies concluded that, to prioritise speed of decision-making and execution of management measures in an increasingly volatile market environment heading into the era of electrification, it would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will, however, continue to "collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companies," it added. (AFP)

    'Higher tram fares would help operator retain talent'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791449_1_20250213121710.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An increase in tram fares would enable the operator to put wages up to find and keep hold of talent, a union chief said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to get the go-ahead to increase adult fares from HK$3 to HK$3.30, child fares from HK$1.50 to HK$1.60 and fares for the over 65s from HK$1.30 to HK$1.50.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company says passenger figures are still about 15 percent down on 2018, before the protests and Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Tramway Workers Union, Yeh Yung-sheng, said fare increases would help the company attract new workers, some of whom would need to learn specialist skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole of the tram's chassis is made by hand. It's not built from parts that are bought from the market... So we need to pass on such techniques," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot just find any workers who can do such work, and it takes time for us to train such workers. [So] if the pay is not good enough, then they might feel that they do not want to learn such techniques."
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on the same RTHK programme, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung, who is a member of Legco's transport panel, said Hong Kong Tramways will lose even more passengers if fares go up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, with the existing prices, trams do not have the so-called competitive advantage. And if you raise the fares further, the gap between the fares of trams and those of buses will be further narrowed, and then even more passenger traffic will be lost," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage of trams in the past was not their speed, but their prices, because it was cost-effective, but if they do not even have that advantage, their original passengers will be lost."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the company could instead take steps to boost passenger numbers, for example by introducing Pokémon or panda-themed trams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Tramways says the proposed fare increases would mainly be spent on renovating its fleet and expanding non-ticket revenue projects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspected gas explosion has hit a department store in the city of Taichung in Taiwan, killing at least four people, authorities there said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The morning blast – which injured at least 23 others – is said to have occurred at the food court on the 12th floor of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store.
  <br>
  <br>
  The floor was believed to be closed for construction work at the time of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the dead were two people visiting from Macau, while a third was severely injured, Macau authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau victims were reportedly part of a family of seven visiting the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parts of the building's exterior were damaged, and scattered fragments were strewn on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the incident is still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's immigration authorities said they have not received any requests for help from SAR residents in the affected area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said it would maintain close contact with tourism representatives here and monitor the situation.

    Taxi union threatens strike over ride-hailing services

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi drivers' union says members will go on strike for at least five days from March 5 unless the authorities take immediate action against illegal ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, told Commercial Radio that they have been left with no choice but to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated that using private cars for the carriage of passengers for reward is illegal, ride-hailing services are illegal, and not having insurance is illegal, everything is illegal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they allow [ride-hailing service] platforms to exist, and indulge them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the industry has been discussing the issue with the government for 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an earlier response to news of a possible strike, the government said it wrote to the companies involved reminding them of legislation which bans drivers from taking passengers for money unless they have a permit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said a working group under the Transport Advisory Committee that is looking at regulating ride-hailing platforms has a meeting arranged with operators and the taxi industry on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials urged the taxi industry to stay calm, be rational and put the public interest first.

    North Korea demolishing family reunion centre: Seoul

<img alt="South Koreans had met with their North Korean relatives during separated family reunions at the Mount Kumgang resort. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791443_1_20250213113318.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea is demolishing a venue that for decades hosted tearful reunions of families separated by the Korean War and the division of the country, Seoul said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reunions in the North's Kumgang mountain, last held in 2018, were a testament to the devastating human cost of the Korean peninsula's division.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the meetings were subject to the vagaries of inter-Korea politics and often used as a negotiating tool by Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demolition of the Mount Kumgang Reunion Center is an inhumane act that tramples on the earnest wishes of separated families," a spokesperson for Seoul's unification ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea "sternly urges an immediate halt to such actions" and "expresses strong regret".
  <br>
  <br>
  "North Korea's unilateral demolition cannot be justified under any pretext, and the North Korean authorities must bear full responsibility for this situation," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 1988, around 130,000 South Koreans have registered their "separated families".
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 2025, around 36,000 of those individuals are still alive, according to official data. Seventy-five percent say they do not know if their relatives are alive or dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some were lucky enough to be chosen to take part in occasional crossborder reunions, mostly hosted at the Mount Kumgang resort.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea has been escalating its rhetoric against its southern neighbour in recent years, designating the south as a "hostile state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also blew up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border last year, which prompted South Korea's military to fire warning shots at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Pyongyang scrapped a 2018 military accord designed to curb the risk of inadvertent clashes between two countries that remain technically at war, prompting the South to take a similar step. (Agencies)

<img alt="Heads of state and business leaders pose for a photo at the conclusion of an artificial intelligence action summit in Paris on Tuesday. Professor William Wong says their agreement is the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing an open and ethical AI.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transparent and innovative environment is essential to the development of artificial development, according to a systems engineering professor, although the industry also needs to be properly regulated to prevent the technology from being misused.
 <br>
  <br>
  William Wong, the director of Chinese University's Centre for Innovation and Technology and a lawmaker, also described as a "surprise" the snub by the United States and the United Kingdom to an international AI declaration at the end of a summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, endorsed by dozens of nations including China, India and hosts France, pledges an open, inclusive and ethical approach to AI development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong said it is common for industry representatives to come together and discuss the path forward for AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been doing that in all universities, not to mention nations, because we understand that artificial intelligence, when you want to apply it, it's high risk because you... leave everything to a machine," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happens if it misbehaves?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the agreement is just the first step of collaboration towards the goal of developing open, transparent, trustworthy and ethical AI technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  'What they have to do is to share more information, and then they would come to a consensus and write out guidelines. When you look at what is happening now, for example even in America, the UK, and France and China, their governments have also issued guidelines in the ethical part of AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if DeepSeek, the Chinese language model developed by a Hangzhou-based startup, could face stiff competition, Wong said that's not necessarily a bad thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You call it competition from the business side. But also you should look... (from the perspective of) the advancement of sciences as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to compare with each other; you compete with each other. And then it comes with more advanced technology. You should look at the positive side of it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top US officials to begin talks on ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The conversations came after Trump's defence secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the Nato military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signalling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He wants it to end. He doesn't want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after speaking with Putin for more than an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace, President Zelenskiy wants peace and I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a meaningful conversation with @POTUS. We... talked about opportunities to achieve peace, discussed our readiness to work together ...and Ukraine's technological capabilities... including drones and other advanced industries," Zelenskiy wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  No Ukraine peace talks have been held since the early months of the conflict, now approaching its third anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be part of any future negotiations on the fate of Ukraine, underscoring that only a fair accord with security guarantees would ensure lasting peace. They said they were ready to enhance support for Ukraine and put it in a position of strength. (Reuters)

    South Korea's Yoon back in court in impeachment trial

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's ousted President Yoon Seok Yeol faces potentially his last impeachment hearing on Thursday over his failed martial law bid before judges begin deliberations on whether to formally remove him from office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former prosecutor has remained defiant through weeks of hearings at Seoul's Constitutional Court, blaming a "malicious" opposition for his December bid to suspend civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attempt only lasted six hours as the opposition-led parliament voted the declaration down, later impeaching him over his attempt to impose martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was detained last month on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ousted president arrived at the court at around 9am local time (0000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's hearing is set to hear evidence from the former chief of South Korea's intelligence service and one of the heads of Seoul's Capital Defence Command, the military unit dispatched to the parliament during the short-lived martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is widely expected – but not officially confirmed – to be Yoon's last hearing before the court's judges go behind closed doors to deliberate whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  That process could take over a week to a fortnight – formerly impeached Presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many legal scholars and experts agree that a unanimous ruling in favour of impeachment will be made by the Constitutional Court judges," said Kim Hyun-jung, a researcher at the Korea University Institute of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  But experts also warn that political wrangling could hold up the trial – prominent conservative supporters of Yoon have called for more hearings to be held.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional judge could also be approved to the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench, which is currently one member short.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court upholds the impeachment, an election must be held within 60 days to choose a new president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Yoon's impeachment trial has centred on the question of whether he violated the constitution by declaring martial law, which is reserved for national emergencies or times of war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suggested last week that even if he had ordered the arrest of MPs to prevent them from voting down his decree, it would not legally matter because it had not been carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges, for which he faces a prison sentence or the death penalty. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk's social media platform X has agreed to settle a lawsuit over what was then Twitter banning Donald Trump after the mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, a newspaper said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  X has agreed to pay about US$10 million to settle a lawsuit that Trump filed against Twitter and its former chief executive Jack Dorsey protesting his ban, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the now infamous insurrection, more than 140 police officers were injured in hours of clashes with pro-Trump rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter and other social media platforms removed Trump at the time due to concerns he would promote further violence with bogus claims that voter fraud caused his loss to Joe Biden in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Billionaire Musk subsequently bought Twitter and renamed it X. Musk reinstated Trump on the platform and was a major Trump supporter during the recent presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has made Musk head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in January agreed to pay Trump US$25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit he filed claiming he was wrongfully censored by Facebook and Instagram after the US Capitol riot, according to the social media giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta in the settlement will not admit wrongdoing over the suspensions of Trump's accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Meta confirmed the settlement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had widely criticised social media platforms for suspending his accounts after the January 6, 2021 insurrection and for comments he made that were seen as praising people engaged in the violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After taking office in January, Trump granted pardons to more than 1,500 of his supporters who stormed the Capitol in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered that all pending criminal cases against Capitol riot defendants be dropped. (AFP)

    Bayern sink Celtic 2-1 in Champions League play-off

<img alt="Bayern Munich applauds the fans following their 2-1 victory over Celtic in their play-off round first leg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791418_1_20250213081308.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kane was on target as Bayern Munich beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, while there were also wins for Benfica, Feyenoord and Club Brugge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are hoping to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their own Allianz Arena in Munich on May 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  They threatened to run riot against the Scottish champions at Celtic Park as they dominated the first half and took the lead just before the interval thanks to a superb Michael Olise strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's second goal came just four minutes after half-time, with the unmarked Kane scoring with a cushioned finish at the back post following a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Kane's seventh goal in this season's Champions League, and his 29th in 29 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Bundesliga leaders took their foot off the pedal after that, allowing Celtic – who had a first-minute Nicolas Kuehn goal disallowed for offside – to come back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brendan Rodgers' team pulled one back as Daizen Maeda scored following a corner with 11 minutes left, but they could not find an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's cliche to say, but it's the first half of the game. Overall, it's a really great result," said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany, according to the BBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic's first home defeat since December 2023 leaves them facing a huge task to try to turn the tie around in Germany next Tuesday, with the winners going through to face either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility," insisted Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Vangelis Pavlidis scored the only goal as Benfica won 1-0 away to Monaco, as the home side were forced to play much of the second half with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica had won 3-2 in Monaco in the league phase in November and they came out on top again at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Pavlidis strike just after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Greek international's sixth goal in his team's last five Champions League outings, a run which includes a hat-trick in the dramatic 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly fell on Wednesday following US inflation data that further clouded the prospects for additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index rose to 3.0 percent in January from a year ago, above the 2.8 percent projected by economists, raising questions about whether the Fed's progress on bringing down prices was reversing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel that the figures reinforced the central bank's recent cautious approach to interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 44,368, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent at 6,051.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Nasdaq, which fell in the morning, finished with a modest gain at 19,649.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities were a lot more resilient than I would have expected given the news we had this morning," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides inflation, markets have also been on edge over President Trump's tariff plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, CVS Health shot up 15 percent following better-than-expected earnings. The pharmacy chain company projected higher profits in 2025 compared with last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilead Sciences jumped 7.5 percent after reporting results that beat expectations as it signaled it could launch its latest HIV prevention drug in the summer of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chevron fell 1.6 percent after announcing it will cut 15 to 20 percent of its workforce as part of a reorganisation to save money and to position the oil giant for the long term. (AFP)

    Everton strike late to hold Liverpool in thriller

<img alt="Tarkowski struck late to salvage a 2-2 draw with Premier League-leaders Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791408_1_20250213060806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool in a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure, Curtis Jones and Slot were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Virgil van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since David Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton then suffered a huge blow as their creative hub Iliman Ndiaye limped off in tears after a long stoppage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first half never recovered its flow amid a flurry of fouls and yellow cards as the Premier League fixture with the most red cards in history threatened to boil over once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton started the better once more in the second period. Doucoure wasted a great chance to retake the lead when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home crowd briefly erupted once more when Branthwaite fired home only for the celebrations to be cut short by the offside flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was growing visibly frustrated with his side's lack of penetration going forward and turned to his bench for an impact with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jones and Darwin Núñez sent on to find a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes worked as Salah delivered what looked like a potential title-clinching moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Núñez exchanged a one-two and when the midfielder's shot was blocked by Branthwaite, it fell kindly for Salah to prod in his 27th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant save by Jordan Pickford crucially denied Salah a second late on. And Everton rallied when Liverpool failed to deal with a hopeful ball into the box and it fell to centre-back Tarkowski to fire into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy VAR check followed for offside and Everton fans had to be cleared off the pitch before the game could restart.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it did there was more fireworks as Doucoure and Jones were both shown a second yellow card for clashing after the Everton midfielder celebrated in front of the travelling Liverpool support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was also shown red for his protests towards referee Michael Oliver. (AFP)

    Arsenal's Havertz out for season with torn hamstring

<img alt="Havertz's injury is the latest blow to Arsenal's Premier League and European ambitions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791406_1_20250213060238.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's bid to win the Premier League could suffer a major setback following reports Kai Havertz is set to be ruled out for the remainder of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German forward sustained an injury during the club's warm-weather training camp in Dubai and was due to face further tests on the club's arrival back in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported on Wednesday the 25-year-old Havertz had suffered a torn hamstring and could now miss the rest of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, however, have yet to comment on the extent of Havertz's injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His potential long-term absence would though compound the problems confronting Gunners boss Mikel Arteta after Arsenal were unable to bolster their attack during the recent January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London club failed in an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz was set to lead Arsenal's line for the rest of the season, with Arteta even saying it was possible the Germany international would have to play every game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus is already out for the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month, whle Bukayo Saka has been absent since December, although there are hopes the England international could return next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, is also sidelined after he was forced off injured during Arsenal's League Cup semi-final second-leg semi-final defeat at Newcastle last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  All these absences leave the Gunners with only three recognised forward players in Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta may well speak about Havertz – who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances this season – on Friday when he holds a pre-match press conference to preview the Gunners' league game away to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are presently second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool but having played a game more, as they attempt to become champions of England for the first time in 21 years. (AFP)

    Pentagon chief lays out red lines on Ukraine at Nato

<div class="itemFullText">
 New US defence chief Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday Washington would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal with Russia, and that Kyiv regaining all its land or joining Nato were not realistic goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a meeting of Kyiv's backers in Brussels, Hegseth laid out President Donald Trump's red lines and demands -- and told Europe to ramp up both support for Ukraine and spending on its own defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US defence chief said any peace process "must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective" -- although Washington, like Europe, wanted "a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine".
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned that "the United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's allies have been waiting nervously for clarity from Trump's administration after the US president demanded that the transatlantic alliance more than double its defence spending target and vowed to end the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's two days of talks in Brussels are part of a flurry of visits to Europe by top US officials, culminating with Vice President JD Vance meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a security conference in Munich on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On both support for Kyiv and Europe's own defence spending, the Pentagon chief delivered the resounding message that Washington expects its allies to do more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato," Hegseth said. "Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth further warned that Washington would not accept what it considers "imbalanced" burden-sharing within the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States remains committed to the Nato alliance and to the defence partnership with Europe, full stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will not travel to Washington for talks at the White House as long as the agenda includes US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza, two Egyptian security sources said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world with a plan to permanently displace the population of more than 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, claim US control of it and turn it into the "Riviera of the Middle East".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has demanded Egypt and Jordan take in the Palestinians, and has threatened to withdraw aid from the two US-allied Arab states if they refuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said Trump had extended an open invitation to Sisi to visit the White House earlier this month. A US official said no date for such a visit has been set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian presidency and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan's King Abdullah appeared uncomfortable during a meeting with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, at which Trump discussed his Gaza plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty visited Washington this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian sources said one aim of his trip was to avert a potentially awkward presidential visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Egyptian sources, it was made apparent to Abdelatty during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the displacement plan would be on the table if Sisi visited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdelatty responded that such a meeting would be of no use, and that any discussion should be over Egypt's own plan for reconstruction of Gaza, the sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt has said its plan would "ensure Palestinians remain on their land". (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three members of the same family have died in Yuen Long in what police say is a suspected murder-suicide case.
 <br>
  <br>
  A man, 93, and his son, 69, were found with multiple stab wounds inside a flat in Chun Hing New Village after police were called at around 8pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 19-year-old man, who was the grandson and son of the deceased, visited the flat before later falling to his death from Yuet Ping House at Long Ping Estate, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased inside the flat had a lot of injuries, and they also bled a lot, so it was difficult to conduct forensic inspections at the scene because it required a lot of cleaning work to determine the cause of death and even the number of injuries," Assistant District Commander Johnathan Kwan told the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The direction of our investigation includes the background of the three deceased, their family relationships, and whether they were involved in any disputes or property disputes."

    Team removed over Greater Bay Airlines cancellations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greater Bay Airlines on Wednesday said it had removed a team of commercial and planning managers, which oversaw the allocation of aircraft resources, due to the recent flight cancellations by the carrier.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the carrier's scheduling failures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan International Airport in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline also assured the move had "no impact on the safety" of its operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also "took excessive time to make decisions" and "communicated the decision poorly".
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle "such a significant number of customer interactions at one time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope Greater Bay Airlines had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed "a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations" as a contributing factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process," Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers," the airline said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National sporting events staged in Hong Kong later this year are expected to draw more than 100,000 spectators, the government said on Wednesday, as the SAR is set to co-host the National Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Games, the nation's highest-level multi-sports event, will be held from November 9 to 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball. Bowling will also be held as a mass participation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, the city will also host several events as part of the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, said officials are working on competition schedules with Guangdong and Macau counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau are discussing the ticketing plans and sales arrangements... The three places will adopt the same sales platform," she said in a written reply to the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be about 1,800 athletes taking part in the eight National Games events held in the SAR, with 700 others participating in the December competitions, Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is estimated that the events in Hong Kong will attract more than 100,000 spectators from Hong Kong, the mainland and other regions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The bureau] is, in collaboration with the relevant departments... conducting a detailed assessment on the traffic and transport arrangements to and from the venues having regard to the transport facilities and capacity of the venues, their past experiences in staging competitions, and the number of participating athletes and spectators for each event."

    US detainee returns home after release by Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said that another detainee would be freed on Wednesday, as he met Marc Fogel, who was released after being held in Russia since 2021.
 <br>
  <br>
  Describing the prisoner deal with Russia as "very fair, very reasonable," Trump said "somebody else is being released tomorrow" without providing details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schoolteacher Fogel, freed by Russia after three and a half years in prison, got a flag-waving welcome from Trump after a flight home from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now," said Fogel, an American flag draped around his shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a middle-class school teacher who’s now in a dream world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, standing alongside Fogel in the White House Diplomatic Reception Room, said: "To me he looks damned good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of 63-year-old Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since August 2021 and was serving a 14-year sentence, came as Trump seeks to improve relations with Moscow as part of an effort to secure an end to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and Fogel both thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just wanted to get him back home," Trump said, and said he would take Fogel on a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom upstairs in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fogel was released into the custody of Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who made an unannounced stop in Moscow on Tuesday to pick him up.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a plane home, Fogel, who is from Pennsylvania, was shown with a raised glass, a cheese plate and his US passport in a photo posted on social media by Trump's chief hostage envoy Adam Boehler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States gave up in exchange for Fogel, Trump told reporters earlier: "Not much" and called the release a show of good faith from the Russians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were treated very nicely by Russia. Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that [Ukraine] war and millions of people can stop being killed," Trump said. (Reuters)

 A suspected E. coli outbreak at Princess Margaret Hospital that is thought to have claimed the life of a doctor and sickened two others could have spread in a washroom, a microbiologist said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong University's Yuen Kwok-yung told RTHK that this is because the bacteria survive longer in humid conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen said the deceased oncologist was young and was not known to have been suffering from chronic illnesses, so work was still ongoing to find out why the doctor may have succumbed to such an infection.

    White House bars AP over its 'Gulf of America' style

<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House Correspondents' Association protested a decision by the White House on Tuesday to bar an Associated Press (AP) reporter from an event with US President Donald Trump over the news agency's decision to continue referring to the Gulf of Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order in January directing the Interior Secretary to change the name to the Gulf of America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House cannot dictate how news organisations report the news, nor should it penalise working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decisions," Eugene Daniels, president of the association, said on Tuesday in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the administration to bar a reporter from the Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said in a statement earlier that its reporter had been blocked from attending an Oval Office event after being informed by the White House it would be barred unless it aligned its editorial standards with Trump's order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism," Pace said, adding that limiting access violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP says in its stylebook that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years and, as a global news agency, the AP will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most news organisations, including Reuters, call it the Gulf of Mexico although, where relevant, Reuters style is to include the context about Trump's executive order. (Reuters)

    Trump presses Jordan's king to take in Palestinians

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump on Tuesday pressed Jordan's King Abdullah to take in Palestinians who would be permanently displaced under the president's plan for the US to take over the Gaza Strip, even as the king said his country was firmly opposed to the move.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking alongside the Arab country's ruler in the White House, Trump implied he would not budge on his idea that involves moving the Gaza Strip's residents and transforming the war-ravaged territory into what he billed a "Riviera of the Middle East."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has infuriated the Arab world by saying that Palestinians would not be able to return to their homes under his proposal to redevelop the enclave, which has been devastated by an Israeli offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to take it. We're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it. We're going to get it going eventually, where a lot of jobs are going to be created for the people in the Middle East," Trump said in the Oval Office, saying his plan would "bring peace" to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  King Abdullah said later that he reiterated to Trump Jordan’s "steadfast position" against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, as well as in the occupied West Bank that borders his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the unified Arab position," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the views of his Jordanian counterpart, Trump said Jordan, as well as Egypt, would ultimately agree to house displaced residents of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries rely on Washington for economic and military aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Jordan. I believe we'll have a parcel of land in Egypt," said Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may have some place else, but I think when we finish our talks, we'll have a place where they're going to live very happily and very safely." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and around 60 other countries on Tuesday signed the final statement of a French-hosted artificial intelligence summit that said AI should be inclusive, open, ethical and safe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Britain did not sign the agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signatories agreed that the two-day summit laid out an open, multi-stakeholder and inclusive approach that will enable AI to be human rights-based, human-centric, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing told the summit that China was willing to work with other countries to safeguard security and share achievements in the field of artificial intelligence to build "a community with a shared future for mankind".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said AI has become an important driving force for the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and Beijing has always participated in global cooperation and governance on AI with a highly responsible attitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Vice President JD Vance said "massive regulations" by the European Union on AI could strangle the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told the summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source close to organisers said they were not surprised that the US had not signed, considering their stance on regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UK government spokesperson said the final statement did not sufficiently address "harder questions around national security".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt the declaration didn't provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it," the spokesperson said. (Agencies)

    Altman dismisses Musk's OpenAI takeover bid

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a US$97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are not for sale,” Altman said on Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk’s bid, announced on Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a non-profit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created as a counterweight to Google's dominance in artificial intelligence, OpenAI got its initial funding from Musk, who invested US$45 million. Three years later, Musk departed OpenAI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Subsequent lawsuits revealed that OpenAI claimed Musk left after his attempts to become CEO or to merge the company with Tesla were rejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT and created a global technology sensation, Musk began criticising the company, trolling it on social media for keeping its source code private and signing a widely publicised manifesto calling for a pause in AI development, even as he pursued his own AI projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August 2024, Musk refiled a lawsuit against OpenAI and its backer Microsoft, claiming the ChatGPT maker had betrayed its founding mission of benefiting the public good in favour of pursuing profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk later updated the lawsuit to prevent OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit company - a change Altman considers crucial for the company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's San Francisco correspondent, Mark Niu, said Musk's bid appeared designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest reports are that the OpenAI board hasn't even seen that proposal. So it's hard to know what's going on. But there is a real feeling that among investors that Musk is really trying to... tie up things in the courts," said Niu. (AP, additional reporting RTHK)

    'SAR working to make renminbi trading more convenient'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791274_1_20250212100123.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, if I want to use the digital renminbi on the mainland, how do I do that? These are the two areas we are working on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added Hong Kong needs to strengthen its role as a financial services hub, saying this is what makes the city appealing to investors.
