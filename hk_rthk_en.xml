  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation has conducted its first dual aircraft carrier formation exercise in the South China Sea, state media said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Broadcaster CCTV said the drills involving the Liaoning and Shandong that took place "in an area of the South China Sea" intended to "hone and enhance the combat capability of the aircraft carrier formation system”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a post accompanied by a video of jets taking off from and landing on the two carriers, CCTV said the exercises also took place in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Xinhua News Agency said the drills “featured multiple subjects under real-combat circumstances”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The reports did not specify when the exercises took place, though they said the broader naval mission had overlapped with public holidays that spanned late September to October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, having been commissioned in 2012. The Shandong entered service in 2019, while a third carrier, the Fujian, is undergoing sea trials. (Additional reporting by AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's economy grew by 1.8 percent in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Growth was slower than the previous two quarters – the second quarter saw a 3.2 percent expansion and first quarter GDP grew by 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the government said growth in exports was down, while private consumption expenditure continued to decline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said the local economy will continue to grow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While global economic uncertainties and trade conflicts may affect Hong Kong's exports of goods, monetary easing across major central banks and an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures would help support sentiment and activities in the domestic market," the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government had projected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Samuel Tse, an economist at DBS Bank, said he expects the economy to improve in the fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the economy hasn't been doing well in the past few quarters. But I think for the fourth quarter, it will be doing a little bit better, given the interest rate cut cycle from the Fed (US Federal Reserve) has already commenced. Mainland China has also started their stimulus packages," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So, these will be translating into some positive effects onto the consumption as well as the investment."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Beijing on Thursday said it was "concerned" over the situation on the Korean Peninsula, after Pyongyang said it had test-fired one of its most powerful missiles to boost its nuclear deterrent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch was North Korea's first weapons test since being accused of sending soldiers to Russia, with South Korea's military saying that its "initial judgement" was that the projectile may have been a "new solid-propelled long-range ballistic missile".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it was "concerned about developments on the [Korean] peninsula".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China... has consistently maintained that preserving peace and stability on the peninsula and promoting the process of political resolution to the peninsula issue aligns with the common interests of all parties," ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope all parties will make efforts toward this goal," he told a regular press briefing in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch came hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, warning that North Korean soldiers in Russian uniforms were being deployed for possible action against Ukraine. (AFP)

    'New medical school can reference the US system'

   Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said Hong Kong’s planned third medical school could be modelled on the American system and focus on admitting students with bachelor’s degrees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the administration would support local universities in establishing a third medical school in the SAR to increase doctor numbers. Authorities would also reserve a site in the Northern Metropolis for the facility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Lo said the new medical school should be innovative in its operations, including on funding and admissions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the institution could reference the American medical school curriculum, which usually lasts for four years and admits those with an undergraduate degree.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This would give us another avenue for admission, because some students were initially undecided about whether they wanted to become a doctor. They might study for a degree first, before realising they really wanted to study medicine. There are other benefits too, such as the students being more mature," Lo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief also said there should be a minimum number of students when the new medical school opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The number of students cannot be too low, or else it will not be cost-effective... Normally speaking, a medical school of the smallest scale would have 50 students as a starting point," Lo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added the new institution and a hospital for teaching and research in Ngau Tam Mei, a rural village in Yuen Long, could possibly cover 2.5 million people in the new development area.

    Labour reps urge action over worker exploitation

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Worker representatives on Thursday met the labour secretary, who they said promised to take steps to stop the exploitation of migrant employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland employees seeking work in Hong Kong under various labour importation schemes must apply through authorised agents, which reportedly charge them fees that can add up to tens of thousands of dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following a meeting with Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, an employee representative on the Labour Advisory Board, Lam Wai-kong, said the minister had promised to take legal and administrative steps to tackle the issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Actually the secretary didn’t specify what the legal and administrative steps would be. But from my own understanding,  the salary for the import workers should be based on the median salary of local workers. If they are not paid correctly that means the agents have broken the law,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “As for administrative steps, in the vetting process for individual labour import applications, I believe the Labour and Welfare Bureau has the ability to make changes to decide whether each case gets approved or not.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that Sun had also agreed to review labour importation schemes sooner, instead of waiting every two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, another representative on the board, Jenny Tam, said they are also worried about the government’s plan to bring in 10,000 skilled workers aged 35 or under over the next three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The secretary had cited the shortage of A-Grade electricians as an example. But we think there are actually enough workers in this field, with many holding licences. We are worried that importing more workers could affect local employment,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam added that Sun responded by saying officials will be prudent and listen to different views.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Snooker superstar Ronnie O’Sullivan has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Department said on social media on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as the Rocket for his fast and attacking playing style, said he enjoyed his time in the SAR in the past and his sport is very popular in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan also said it’s a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My plan in Hong Kong is, obviously, here to do some work. But I love the food. I love to just, relax here in Hong Kong," he said in a video clip on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Maybe I'm going to play some snooker, just see some friends maybe. It's just really nice to be back in Hong Kong again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan, currently ranked fifth in the world, won the Hong Kong Snooker Masters two years ago, saying at the time that he enjoyed the hiking trails in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His decision to obtain Hong Kong residency comes after a similar move last year by retired basketball star Stephon Marbury, whose playing career spanned over two decades in the National Basketball Association in the US and the Chinese Basketball Association.

  <img alt="For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777014_1_20241031144239.jpg&q=55" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Thursday said they have developed a new AI medical model that answers questions like ChatGPT.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chatbot is one of four new AI models unveiled by the university which can diagnose up to 30 types of cancers and diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Professor Chen Hao, who led the project, said the "MedDr" model can generate reports and provide initial diagnoses based on medical images.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Users can send close-up images and the chatbot will then analyse what is wrong and offer treatment suggestions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said it can save a lot of time spent on doctor's appointments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We hope to actually see 30 to 40 percent [reduction in time]. Some doctors are very interested in using this in the waiting room, because the patients spend a lot of time in the waiting room but when they see a doctor it’s just actually a few minutes,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We wanted to actually leverage this multimodal language model to let the patients ask the questions and then you have a summary and then doctors will quickly actually see the summary and understand the background of the patients.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chen added that the university will work with local hospitals and consult more medical practitioners to ensure the tool's accuracy.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Los Angeles Dodgers produced a stunning fightback to defeat the New York Yankees and clinch the World Series on Wednesday with a dramatic come-from-behind 7-6 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a night of spellbinding drama at Yankee Stadium, the Dodgers sealed their second Major League Baseball championship crown in five seasons and eighth overall after recovering from 5-0 down to complete a 4-1 series victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, who had kept the series alive with an 11-4 rout in game four on Tuesday, had looked poised to take the series back to Los Angeles for game six after home runs from Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees starter Gerrit Cole meanwhile produced a masterful performance from the mound to keep the Dodgers' potent offensive line-up scoreless through four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a catastrophic fifth inning by the Yankees, which included a litany of defensive errors, saw the Dodgers pile on five unearned runs to tie the score at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Yankees regained the lead through a Stanton sacrifice-fly in the sixth inning, the Dodgers hit back in the eighth with sac-flys of their own from Gavin Lux and Mookie Betts to claim what turned out to be a winning 7-6 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers then brought back game three starter Walker Buehler to bag the final three outs in the ninth to clinch victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously we're resilient, but there's so much love in this clubhouse, care – that care won this game today," said Dodgers star Betts. "That's what it was. It was love, it was grit – it was just a beautiful thing and I'm just proud of us and I'm happy for us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Buehler, meanwhile, admitted he had not been expecting to play a part in the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wish I was in a little better shape so my heart could have handled it better," the Dodgers pitcher said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers star Freddie Freeman, who blasted four consecutive home runs in the opening four games of the series, was named Series Most Valuable Player.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we were all saying the first three innings – 'let's just get one, just chip away, we can do this,'" said Freeman, who drove in two runs in the fifth inning rally with a single. "There's a couple of mistakes that happened, you've got to capitalise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers had gone into Wednesday's game quietly confident, with victorious game one starter Jack Flaherty back on the mound.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Flaherty's eve-of-Halloween outing turned into a horror show as the revived Yankees bats cut loose to leave the Dodgers reeling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and then Chisholm followed it with a solo shot to put the Yankees 3-0 ahead, before Alex Verdugo drove in a run for Anthony Volpe to make it 4-0 in the second, prompting Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to remove Flaherty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stanton's third inning solo home run made it a five-run game but after that dream start, the wheels fell off in the fifth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enrique Hernandez launched the Dodgers rally with a single to lead off the inning and then Tommy Edman was given a reprieve when Judge flubbed a catch in center-field that left the Dodgers with two men on base and no outs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a terrible mix-up between Cole and first baseman Anthony Rizzo allowed Betts to single and score Hernandez to make it 5-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman then took full advantage, doubling to score Edman and Will Smith to make it 5-3 with runners on first and third. Teoscar Hernandez then drove a double to center-field to bring in two more runs and the game was suddenly tied at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Dodgers conjured another rally, with Lux and Betts bagging sac-flys to snatch a one-run lead at 7-6, leaving Buehler to close out victory in the ninth. (AFP)

  <img alt="The manufacturing sector returned to the expansion zone for the first time since April.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Up to 20 students per year are to be given scholarships to study postgraduate courses at the University of Cambridge, under an initiative launched by the world-renowned British institution and City University of Hong Kong (CityU).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The funding, totalling HK$10 million per year, will enable the students to do a one-year, full-time master's programme at Lucy Cavendish College, one of the largest constituent colleges of Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The aim is to have our students, graduates going for this course, to stay at Lucy Cavendish [College] and become a graduate for the world," said CityU president Freddy Boey on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This programme does not require them to come back to Hong Kong, but I'm pretty sure, as graduate alumni of this special programme, they will do us proud anywhere in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The programme, which will initially run for five years, will also accept applications from other students if the slots are not filled up by CityU graduates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Madeleine Atkins, president of Lucy Cavendish College, said graduates of all disciplines are welcome, adding that Hong Kong students are "highly competitive candidates" for master's courses at Cambridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We take students from across all the master's programmes at Cambridge, because we believe that many of the problems in this world require interdisciplinary solutions. By living and learning together on this programme, students from different academic backgrounds do benefit from the experience of working closely on projects and teams with those from other disciplines," said Atkins.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   CityU has also partnered with the British college for the Future Global Leaders Programme, which equips students with skills to address pressing global issues.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bar owners can expect Halloween to bring them at least a 10 percent boost in business, industry representatives said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lan Kwai Fong Group chairman Allan Zeman said the build up to Halloween this year has been the best to date, with people heading out to celebrate since last Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This year especially, what the restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong are doing, one's doing a hell's wedding theme, with Halloween menus. Another one's got cult class zombie movies with a big banquet. Every restaurant's doing dress-up parties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zeman said he believes business will surge by 10 to 25 percent, adding that restaurants in the area are almost fully booked.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been packed. I think tonight will be very very busy, and I am not even sure it will go until tomorrow or even Sunday. But it's totally different. It's not a one-day holiday now, this year especially they started early... I was surprised, totally surprised along with everyone else."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chin Chun-wing who chairs the Hong Kong Bar and Club Association said he is anticipating a minimum 10 percent growth in business over the next two nights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Halloween isn't a thing on the mainland. Therefore we see a lot of mainlanders coming to Hong Kong to really experience the vibes, as well as take photos with revellers," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many people put on Halloween make-up. You can see that this year, there were a lot more youths of around 20 years old, all of them put on heavy make-up to enjoy the festival."

   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday spent a second day in Riyadh promoting business opportunities for Hong Kong in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a delegation of more than 110 people on a three-day trip to the Saudi capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Following the morning listing ceremony for the first exchange-traded fund in Saudi Arabia that invests in Hong Kong stocks on the Saudi Exchange, Chan met with Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Chang Hua, at noon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan updated the ambassador on Hong Kong's economy while the pair talked about cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial secretary then co-hosted a roundtable with the chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, Mohammed bin Abdullah Elkuwaiz, in which representatives from regulatory bodies and various asset management firms gathered to discuss recent developments in financial markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan later met with the Governor of the Saudi Central Bank, Ayman Alsayari, and pair discussed strengthening ties in investment and financial markets between Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, along with cooperation in digital finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the evening, the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks held an event featuring over 20 startups in fields like green tech and AI, hoping to connect with investors and business partners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan will wrap up his visit today and is expected to arrive back in Hong Kong at around noon on Friday.

    Lakers fall to Cavs as Bronny scores first NBA bucket

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   It was a homecoming for Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James on Wednesday, as his son Bronny secured his first-ever NBA career bucket in their team's 134-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the 39-year-old Lakers superstar watched from the bench, Bronny James scored his first points in an NBA game on a shot that looked just like his old man.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second game featuring a father-son duo, LeBron checked out in the fourth quarter and sat back to enjoy seeing his son soak in the love of a Cleveland crowd that cheered his every move for 11 seasons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the Cavs on their way to the blowout victory, Cleveland fans began chanting “We want Bronny!”, hoping to see the rookie they watched grow up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The younger James checked in with 5:16 left and was cheered every time he touched the ball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He picked up two assists and then made his first basket as a pro on a 14-foot shot from the left corner with 2:03 left, triggering a huge ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland took control with a red-hot first quarter, connecting on 77.3 percent of their shots from the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Cavs led by 19 at halftime and turnovers doomed the Lakers' efforts to make significant inroads in the third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James led the Lakers with 26 points. Anthony Davis added 22 with 13 rebounds but Los Angeles dropped their second straight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lakers head coach J.J. Redick had high praise for Bronny despite the loss.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I told him congratulations,” he said. “It's a big deal to score your first NBA points, and the fact he did it back here in Cleveland was a bright spot.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When Bronny was little, he ran through the hallways, rode the elevators and took shots or played pickup on the practice court inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse – all while his famous father played in games for the Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in the day, Bronny reflected on his Ohio homecoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s going to be real special,” he said following the morning shootaround. “It feels good to be out here with my dad – in our home.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron spent 11 seasons over two stints with the Cavs, leading them to the 2016 title before leaving as a free agent two years later. Last week, the 39-year-old superstar and his 20-year-old son became the first father-son duo to play in an NBA game. (AP/AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two New York Yankees fans who interfered with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts as he tried to make a catch were barred from Wednesday's fifth game of the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees announced hours before the crucial clash in New York that the spectators, who were seated in the from row along the wall in foul territory in right field, were ejected after trying to block the player and take the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened in the first inning of New York's 11-4 victory, which lifted the Yankees within 3-1 in Major League Baseball's best-of-seven championship showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Last night, two fans were ejected from Yankee Stadium for egregious and unacceptable physical contact with Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts," the Yankees said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The safety and security of players, fans and stadium staff is the foundational element of every event held at Yankee Stadium," it added. "It cannot be compromised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however the exuberance of supporting one's team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk," the statement went on to say.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Yankees and Major League Baseball maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of behavior displayed last night – these fans will not be permitted to attend tonight's game in any capacity."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts tried to make a grab off a ball hit by New York's Gleyber Torres but as he leaped above the wall in foul territory, one fan grabbed his right hand and the other pulled the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Torres was called out due to fan interference on the play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've never seen anything like it," said Dodgers starting pitcher Ben Casparius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That looked ridiculous from my perspective," Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman said. "The guy was trying to yank his glove off, pulling at his wrist. Looked like he got ejected and I'm glad he did. I've never seen anything like that – that was unacceptable." (AFP)

    Medvedev loses to Australian Popyrin at Paris Masters

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Daniil Medvedev is still searching for his first ATP tournament victory this year after the world number five lost to Australia's Alexei Popyrin for the first time in his career at the Paris Masters on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev won the Paris title in 2020 but has not found the indoor tournament to his liking in recent years – the defeat to Popyrin is the third successive time he has gone out in his opening round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin, who has been on a rich vein of form this year winning his first Masters tournament in Montreal in August and beating Novak Djokovic in the US Open, edged Medvedev 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a gripping second round match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Popyrin, ranked 24 in the world, it was only his third win over a player in the top five.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is the first time I have beaten him," said Popyrin. "We have had some right old battles in the past and it is a real pleasure to have performed like this this time round."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin will next play Karen Khachanov after the Russian downed France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (12/14), 6-1, 6-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev, who has already qualified for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals next month, fought back twice in the deciding set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He came back from 4-1 down to force a tie-break and then trailing 4-1 in that he levelled at 4-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, with Popyrin leading 5-4, Medvedev double-faulted giving the 25-year-old Australian two match points and he wasted no time in sealing the victory on the first one. (AFP)

    N Korea fires 'long-range' ballistic missile: Seoul

  <img alt="The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776947_1_20241031075514.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   North Korea on Thursday fired a "long-range ballistic missile", South Korea's military said, Pyongyang's first weapons test since Seoul accused it of sending tens of thousands of soldiers to Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea's military had warned a day earlier that the nuclear-armed North was preparing to test another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or even conduct a nuclear test, possibly ahead of next week's US elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military detected one ballistic missile launched from the Pyongyang area toward the East Sea at approximately 7:10 AM (2210 GMT) today," Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The ballistic missile is presumed to be a long-range missile launched at a high angle," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea typically test-fires its longest-range and most powerful missiles on a so-called lofted trajectory – fired up, not out – which it says is to avoid overflying neighbouring countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our military has heightened its alert level and is closely sharing information regarding North Korea's ballistic missile with the US and Japan authorities, maintaining a thorough readiness posture," Seoul's JCS added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo also confirmed a possible launch, with Japan's coastguard reporting an "object potentially a ballistic missile launched from North Korea" and warning vessels to take care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The launch came just hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, where Washington says some 10,000 have been deployed for possible action against Ukrainian forces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The defence chiefs of South Korea and the United States condemned North Korea's troop deployment to Russia in the "strongest" terms at the allies' annual defence talks at the Pentagon on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has previously said the nuclear-armed North's accelerating deployment posed a "significant security threat," with the military telling lawmakers on Wednesday that thousands of troops had been moved to western Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The fact that such a large number of personnel has moved westward suggests they are unlikely to have gone merely for observation," a presidential official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en mass in the wake of Kim Jong-un's signing of a mutual defence deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has denied sending troops, but in the first comment in state media last week, its vice foreign minister said that if such a deployment to happen, it would be in line with international law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pyongyang is banned from tests using ballistic technology by multiple rounds of UN sanctions, but Kim Jong-un has ramped up testing this year, with experts warning he could be testing weaponry before providing it to Russia. (AFP)

    UK to raise taxes by 40 billion pounds annually

  <img alt="Rachel Reeves announces a string of tax increases, as she seeks to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776929_1_20241031012156.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's new finance minister Rachel Reeves announced the biggest tax increases in three decades in her first budget on Wednesday, accusing the former Conservative government of breaking the country's public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Businesses and the wealthy were set to bear the brunt of the tax hikes, and Reeves also paved the way for higher borrowing for investment to speed up Britain's economy, which has been slowed by the 2007-09 global financial crisis, Brexit, Covid and soaring energy prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Bank of England economist – who said she was proud to be the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer – stressed there would be no repeat of how former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss sent the bond market into a tailspin in 2022 with her unfunded tax cut plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial reaction to her speech suggested investors were unfazed by the Labour Party's first economic programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But government prices fell later as the scale of the planned spending became apparent and investors scaled back their bets on Bank of England interest rate cuts next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said she would raise taxes by 40 billion pounds (US$52 billion) a year, blaming the Conservatives for leaving her Labour Party with a budget "black hole".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any responsible Chancellor would take action," she said. "That is why today, I am restoring stability to our public finances and rebuilding our public services." She painted a grim picture of Britain, with record waiting times in the health service, children studying in crumbling schools and dysfunctional transport and justice systems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, tax hikes of 40 billion pounds would be equivalent to 1.25 percent of economic output, surpassed in recent history only in 1993 by a budget plan under the Conservatives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Keir Starmer had warned "those with the broadest shoulders" would have to pay more to spare "working people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on 10-year British government bonds – which moves in the opposite direction to prices – was up by around four basis points on the day at 1600 GMT, having fallen sharply during Reeves' speech earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors were pricing in fewer interest rate cuts by the BoE given the scale of government spending with four quarter-point reductions expected in 2025 compared with about five earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves announced a string of tax increases, saying "difficult decisions cannot be constantly delayed or deferred" as she sought to uphold her new rule get day-to-day spending back into balance by the end of the decade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate of social security contributions paid by employers will rise by 1.2 percentage points to 15 percent from April, and a threshold at which firms start to pay it will come down, raising an extra 25 billion pounds a year in five years' time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other revenue-raising moves included changes to taxes on capital gains and inheritances and tax paid by private equity executives, non-domiciled residents and users of private jets and private schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Reeves unexpectedly ruled out making more individuals pay basic and higher income tax rates after a freeze on the threshold for payments expires in the 2028/29 tax year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also extended a freeze on fuel duty and cut a tax on draught beer in pubs, measures that could help to reverse a fall in support for Starmer's fledgling government in opinion polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another significant move, Reeves said she would change a second fiscal rule to allow for more borrowing, paving the way for 100 billion pounds in investment over the next five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves said the government will now target a fall in public sector net financial liabilities as a share of the economy, rather than public sector net debt excluding the BoE. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed lower on Wednesday despite positive US economic data, as investors assessed company earnings including reports after the bell by major tech names Facebook-parent Meta and Microsoft.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones retreated 0.2 percent to 42,141, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.3 percent to 5,813.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq lost 0.6 percent to 18,607.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The market appears to be searching for a "next catalyst" to determine if it can keep moving higher, said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For now, he added, "Alphabet is doing very well on the back of its earnings report. But at the same time, you have some other earnings results that were not received quite as well."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed 2.9 percent higher, a day after it reported solid third quarter results with revenue climbing 15 percent from a year ago to US$88.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But other companies saw their share prices drop.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares in Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, lost 2.1 percent as it reported a drop in sales and lowered its revenue outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.6 percent although its results came in slightly above expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In after-hours trading, Meta shares fell more than two percent shortly after reporting profits that surpassed market expectations, while Microsoft gained 0.8 percent on strong growth in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The performance of Wall Street came despite the US economy expanding 2.8 percent in the third quarter according to government data.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was a solid figure although a slight slowdown from the previous quarter. Data from payroll firm ADP also showed private sector hiring surged more than expected. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buried with a padlock on her foot and an iron sickle across her neck, "Zosia" was never supposed to be able to come back from the dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Entombed in an unmarked cemetery in Pien, northern Poland, the young woman was one of dozens feared by her neighbours to have been a "vampire".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Now, using DNA, 3D printing and modelling clay, a team of scientists has reconstructed Zosia's 400-year-old face, revealing the human story buried by supernatural beliefs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's really ironic, in a way," said Swedish archaeologist Oscar Nilsson. "These people burying her, they did everything they could in order to prevent her from coming back from the dead... we have done everything we can in order to bring her back to life."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia, as she was named by locals, was found in 2022 by a team of archaeologists from Torun's Nicolaus Copernicus University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aged 18-20 when she died, analysis of Zosia's skull suggests she suffered from a health condition which would have caused fainting and severe headaches, as well as possible mental health issues, Nilsson said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sickle, the padlock and certain types of wood found at the grave site were all believed at the time to hold magical properties protecting against vampires, according to the Nicolaus Copernicus team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zosia's was Grave No. 75 at the unmarked cemetery in Pien, outside the northern city of Bydgoszcz. Among the other bodies found at the site was a "vampire" child, buried face down and similarly padlocked at the foot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Little is known of Zosia's life, but Nilsson and the Pien team say items she was buried with point to her being from a wealthy — possibly noble — family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 17th century Europe she lived in was ravaged by war, something Nilsson suggests created a climate of fear in which belief in supernatural monsters was commonplace.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson's recreation began with creating a 3D printed replica of the skull, before gradually building layers of plasticine clay "muscle by muscle" to form a life-like face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He uses bone structure combined with information on gender, age, ethnicity and approximate weight to estimate the depth of facial features.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's emotional to watch a face coming back from the dead, especially when you know the story about this young girl," Nilsson says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nilsson said he wanted to bring Zosia back "as a human, and not as this monster that she is buried as". (Reuters)

    At least 95 dead as Spain hit by torrential floods

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain braced for a heavier human toll after at least 95 people died in flash floods that launched muddy waters through towns, tossed cars and wreaked transport havoc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rescuers were expected to find more bodies in the European country's deadliest flood in more than 50 years and three days of official mourning were due to start on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Television pictures from the town of Utiel showed rescuers using dinghies worked in the dark to scour the floodwaters and taking several people to safety. Emergency services were still working to reach the worst-hit areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For those who at this moment are still looking for their loved ones, the whole of Spain weeps with you," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address, vowing to "rebuild your streets, your squares, your bridges".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of citrus production in the world's top orange supplier, said some people remained isolated in inaccessible locations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If (emergency services) have not arrived, it's not due to a lack of means or predisposition, but a problem of access," Mazon told a press conference, adding that reaching certain areas was "absolutely impossible".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 62 people died in Valencia, while authorities in the central region of Castilla La Mancha said the storm had left two people dead and several missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dozens of videos shared on social media overnight appeared to show people trapped by the floodwaters, with some climbing into trees to avoid being swept away. Footage showed rescue workers carrying several women in a bulldozer's bucket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trains to the cities of Madrid and Barcelona were cancelled due to the flooding, and schools and other essential services were suspended in the worst-hit areas, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emergency services in the region urged citizens to avoid all road travel and to follow further official advice, and a military unit specialised in rescue operations was deployed in some places to help local emergency workers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some parts of the region such as the towns of Turis, Chiva or Bunol recorded more than 400 millimetres of rainfall - equivalent to a year of normal rainfall - leading the state weather agency AEMET to declare a red alert on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As rain eased there, the alert was lowered to amber, but with the storm moving in a northeasterly direction, the regional weather service in Catalonia issued a red alert for the area around Barcelona, warning of high winds and hail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Europe due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. (Agencies)

    'Give Choi Hung Estate residents more housing options'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Lawmaker Bill Tang on Wednesday urged the government to offer more options to residents of Choi Hung Estate who need to be rehoused in the first phase of a massive redevelopment plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities say 2,450 flats at the new Mei Tung Estate in Wong Tai Sin will be available to house the first batch of residents affected when construction starts in 2028, and they can also consider buying a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, says authorities should also allow affected residents to move into any empty flats available in other parts of Choi Hung Estate that will only be redeveloped in 2035 or later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents who live in the first phase… they know they need to move out, but they really want to stay in Choi Hung. We suggest there should be diverse options for the phase one residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmaker also noted that volunteers will need to be recruited to assist elderly families that will have to relocate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang also expressed concerns that the current timetable for the entire redevelopment project spans two decades from 2028 to 2048, saying buildings will be so old by the end they may be unsafe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The residents living in Choi Hung [Estate] must live with a construction site for over 20 years,” he said. “The first building will be removed and then rebuilt and from the first building to the last building, it will be over 20 years. That means the last building will be removed maybe at the age of 80 years old," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Choi Hung resident Tsang said while the current arrangements aren’t perfect, he’s planning to move to Mei Tung Estate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm somewhat satisfied but transportation is not as convenient as Choi Hung. You have to walk quite a bit either to Lok Fu or Wong Tai Sin Station – but what can you do? It's better than nothing and we have a place to settle down," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fellow resident Pang said he will be closing his small shop of 20 years in Choi Hung Estate soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's hard to maintain a small shop in a public housing estate, especially with everyone shopping up north. The spending patterns have changed significantly and the ageing population is increasing," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A woman surnamed Fan meanwhile, said she hopes that authorities could maintain some key elements of Choi Hung Estate – famed for its rainbow colour scheme – as they bring good memories to many people.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

    Choi Hung Estate to be redeveloped in three phases

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Choi Hung Estate will be redeveloped in three phases, with the first batch of affected residents set to be relocated in about four years’ time, according to a paper submitted by housing authorities on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The redevelopment plan’s timeline for the estate built in the 1960s and famous for its rainbow colour theme was unveiled in the paper submitted to the Wong Tai Sin District Council, in which the Housing Department said the first phase would involve three blocks – Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House – as well as two vacant school sites.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The new Mei Tung Estate, which is expected to start taking in residents in 2028-29, will provide 2,450 units for the first phase of relocation, accommodating about one-third of the affected Choi Hung Estate residents," the paper said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the area in the first phase is cleared out, construction will begin immediately and it will be able to provide about 3,200 units to residents of four blocks affected by the second stage of redevelopment, expected to take place from 2035-36.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The area involved in the second phase will then be able to take care of the last batch of households. These residents will move into some 4,100 newly built units between 2042 and 2043.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The relocation process would take roughly 15 years, the department added, and by 2048, the last phase of the estate is expected to be redeveloped to offer 1,900 flats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In total, the new Choi Hung Estate will be able to accommodate 9,200 households, up from the current 7,400.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said the redevelopment would also provide an opportunity to improve traffic conditions at the Choi Hung Interchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Housing Authority has begun discussions with relevant departments to free up part of the Choi Hung Estate site to alleviate traffic congestion in the area,” the paper said.

   The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-19 spaceflight mission have entered the Tiangong space station and met with three others, starting a new round of in-orbit crew handover.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-18 crew opened the hatch at 12.51pm on Wednesday (Beijing time) and greeted the new arrivals, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The six crew members then took group pictures for the fifth space get-together in China's aerospace history. They will live and work together for about five days to complete planned tasks and handover work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-19 astronauts – Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze – will stay at the Tiangong space station for approximately six months and conduct a series of experiments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-19 blasted off early Wednesday morning atop a Long March-2F rocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China declared the launch a "complete success".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-18 crew, meanwhile, is set to return to Earth on Monday. (Reporting by Xinhua)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The University of Hong Kong on Wednesday said diabetes patients can lower the risk of getting colorectal and liver cancers, the second and fifth most common in the SAR, by controlling their blood glucose levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Faculty of Medicine conducted two territory-wide analyses using 17 years of Hospital Authority data involving 140,000 diabetes patients.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It found that by controlling blood glucose levels, such patients can lower the chances of getting colorectal cancer by 28 percent, and liver cancer by 30 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Cancer cells, when they have a lot of sugar around them, they are able to grow faster. This is in essence the way which patients with diabetes, if it is poorly controlled, they will have an increase risk of both bowel cancer and liver cancer," explained the university's Dr Walter Seto, who led the project.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media briefing, Seto added that those with diabetes are twice as likely to get these cancers compared with healthy individuals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dr Paul Lee, who specialises in endocrinology and diabetes, told RTHK that patients can improve their blood glucose levels through a good diet and more exercise.

  <img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the debut of Saudi Arabia's first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Hong Kong-listed equities will strengthen cooperation between the two places.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan's remark came as trading of such ETFs began on the Saudi stock exchange.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Issuer Albilad Capital and its partner CSOP Asset Management said the trading of the product raised more than US$1.2 billion at the start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters in Riyadh after the listing ceremony, Chan said the ETFs open doors for Middle Eastern investors to capital markets beyond the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Middle Eastern investors can gain easy access to our Hong Kong markets. However, this investment extends beyond just Hong Kong. As you know, more than 70 percent of the market value of listed companies in Hong Kong comes from the mainland. Therefore, investing in the Hong Kong market is equivalent to investing in key sectors of the mainland," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asia's first ETF covering Saudi Arabian stocks made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last November. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

   Hong Kong’s stock market operator on Wednesday said it will open an office in Riyadh next year, boosting its global coverage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said the new office in the Saudi Arabian capital would help investors in the Middle East better access financial products and capital markets in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its CEO Bonnie Chan pointed out that the Riyadh branch will join HKEX’s other offices in Beijing, Shanghai, London, New York, and Singapore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The new Riyadh office will enable us to foster greater global coverage and facilitate access for Middle East clients to Asia’s most international, diverse and liquid capital markets in Hong Kong."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement came as the trading of Saudi Arabia’s first exchange-traded fund that tracks Hong Kong-listed shares kicked off.

   The Development Bureau on Wednesday said about 5,600 people have visited an exhibition showcasing the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on social media, it said the people who were trying to catch a glimpse of the bones displayed at the Heritage Discovery Centre at Kowloon Park included students and tourists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that temporary studios and showrooms at the centre will open by the end of the year, and visitors would even be able to watch paleontologists prepare fossils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau also said that mainland and local experts are still carrying out excavation work on Port Island, where the fossils were found.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that the team had to carry generators and excavation tools to the island, in the northeastern waters of the SAR, as there is no electricity supply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities added that apart from collaborating with mainland experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, they are also contacting local experts for future research and education endeavours.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The mainland is set to issue one-off permits to allow Hong Kong newborns to travel there, according to DAB chairman Gary Chan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said on Wednesday that DAB lawmakers have received calls for help from parents saying they had hoped to travel across the border with their newborns, but applications for temporary mainland travel permits take at least five working days to process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a letter to Chan, national immigration officials said parents of Hong Kong-born babies "with urgent need to travel to the mainland" can get a one-off permit at Luohu, Huanggang, Shekou or Shenzhen airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parents will be required to provide their newborn's identity document and birth certificate for the permit valid for one return trip between Hong Kong and the mainland within a three-month period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As long as the parents need a permit, they can bring the relevant documents to the four border crossings to apply for a document and collect it on the spot. It is more convenient and quicker than before, and can meet the needs of parents with newborns," Chan said, adding that he hoped the new arrangement could be extended to other border control points.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Wednesday said the number of domestic violence cases handled by social welfare officials has fallen in recent years, but there's been a rise in the number of children in need of protection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a written reply to lawmakers, welfare minister Chris Sun said that overall, domestic violence cases dropped by 13.5 percent from 2019 figures, to nearly 3,400 last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But child protection cases rose by 45 percent in the same period, to more than 1,450.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These cases were referred to the Social Welfare Department for follow-up action after reports were filed to the police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said for cases considered to be high risk by police officers, the department makes a crisis intervention and provides a wide range of support, including psychological help, as well as centres for family crisis support, refuges and residential and daily child care.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that some people who refuse help are given a card with the details of other places they can seek assistance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are promotional campaigns from the department and the police encouraging people to seek help early and avoid resorting to violence, the minister said.

   The restrictions will take effect on January 2, targeting investments in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China firmly opposes the United States issuing final rules on investment restrictions on China and has lodged stern representations with the United States," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The United States has generalised the concept of national security," the statement said, calling the restrictions a "typical non-market practice".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rules will "damage the interests" of firms in both China and the United States, the statement warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China "reserves the right to take measures", it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US Treasury assistant secretary for investment security Paul Rosen had said in a statement that the areas targeted by the latest US curbs "are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors will also be required under the rules to inform authorities about investments in some less advanced technologies that could threaten US national security, the department added. (AFP)

    New offence planned to tackle abandoned cars

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Transport officials say they have come up with a way to help stop people dumping cars they no longer want in alleys and at the side of roads, by plugging a loophole that lets owners off the hook if they stop renewing a vehicle's licence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At present, a vehicle's registration is automatically cancelled if it hasn't had a valid licence for two years. The person whose name the vehicle is registered under can then no longer be held liable for anything related to it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some irresponsible owners take advantage of this arrangement and abandon their unwanted vehicles on public roads and public back alleys, causing environmental hygiene and congestion issues," the Transport and Logistics Bureau says in a paper to Legco.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To address the matter, the bureau is proposing an amendment to road traffic regulations which would scrap the automatic cancelling of a vehicle's registration and instead enable officials to send owners a notice after two years, giving them three months to either renew their licence or take action to de-register the vehicle themselves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Options for de-registration include having the vehicle scrapped, or shipping it out of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau is proposing fines of up to HK$10,000 and prison terms of up to three months for people who ignore the notices, with a subsequent conviction for the same offence leading to fines of up to HK$25,000 and jail terms as long as six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the fines go unpaid, the authorities would refuse to issue or renew the offender's driving licence or to license any vehicle in their name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bureau said a commencement date for the proposed new offence is expected to be fixed by notice in the Gazette in the fourth quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK he welcomes the proposed changes, saying they could put a stop to vehicles being dumped.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They will impose a penalty which is more expensive than scrapping the car. So I think that's a good way to avoid people abandoning a car after the licence expires," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmaker Gary Zhang said he thinks there should be exemptions in some cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If a situation doesn't really involve illegal abandonment, for example, some car owners may simply not renew their registration due to personal reasons, or they don't plan to drive any more, or just park in their garage, I think the government shouldn't interfere too much," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Anthony Volpe smashed a grand slam as the New York Yankees avoided being swept in the World Series on Tuesday with an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Volpe's third-inning home run gave the Yankees a 5-2 edge, their first lead since game one, and later homers by Gleyber Torres and Austin Wells sparked New York's rout.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees pulled within 3-1 in the best-of seven Major League Baseball championship showdown with game five on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series, but the Yankees became the first team in 54 years to force a fifth game when down 0-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York denied the Dodgers an eighth World Series title and first since 2020 while keeping alive hopes of the Yankees winning their first crown since 2009 and 28th overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a record-shattering night for Los Angeles first baseman Freddie Freeman, who smashed a two-run homer in the first inning to become the first player with homers in the first four games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who blasted a walk-off grand slam to win game one, also moved past George Springer to set a record with homers in six consecutive World Series contests, counting the last two games from his 2021 title run with Atlanta. (AFP)

    Growing interest in trading in own currency, says FS

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between Beijing and Riyadh.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   She sustained multiple injuries and was declared dead after being rushed to Princess Margaret Hospital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The taxi driver, 66, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   An astrophysicist said the country's first civilian female astronaut, who joined the Shenzhou-19 spaceship, will inspire young women to join fields typically dominated by men.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang Haoze was among three astronauts who blasted off to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quentin Parker, director of Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that having the nation's only female spaceflight engineer onboard is significant towards the development of gender equality among industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We had a couple of missions back, we had the first civilian taikonaut who went up, Professor Gui [Haichao] from Beihang University, in Beijing. He was the first person that wasn't from the Chinese People's Liberation Army to actually go to space... Now we've got the first female flight engineer, which I think is an excellent thing," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think, as a role model for young Chinese women aspiring to get into what traditionally has been a male domain of engineering, more and more females are occupying all areas of technology opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apart from carrying out 86 science research and technology tests, the trio's mission also includes installing protective devices against space debris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Space debris is becoming more and more of an existential threat to everything in low Earth orbit, actually. And what that is, is you're (going to get) the threat of cascading catastrophic collapse of the environment in low Earth orbit," Parker said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The astrophysicist believes that the Chinese space station, which he said is only a third of a size of the international space station, will be expanded in the next couple of years.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kamala Harris warned against Donald Trump's bid to seize "unchecked power" in a fiery speech on Tuesday at the spot where her rival riled up a mob before the deadly January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are," Harris told a huge crowd of flag-waving supporters against the imposing backdrop of the White House in Washington.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The campaign claimed 75,000 people attended the rally, which comes just a week before the current Democratic vice president faces the Republican former president in the closest and most volatile election of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number could not be immediately verified, but the crowd was unusually big in an election that has already seen heavy enthusiasm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of the Ellipse – a park linking the White House to the vast National Mall – was a direct attempt by her campaign to remind voters of the chaos caused by Trump's attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Trump urged supporters in a speech there to "fight like hell," many then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, in an assault that left 140 police officers wounded and shocked the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The choice of venue – the White House lit up against the night in the background – was also a symbolic pitch to show Harris ready for the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking from behind bulletproof screens next to blue signs saying "Freedom," Harris pledged to be a "president for all Americans" – unlike Trump, whom she accused of wanting to jail his enemies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And although her speech began with the dramatic put-down of Trump's behavior, she soon pivoted to a recap of her detailed plans to help financially struggling middle class Americans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She got one of the biggest cheers when she referred to Republicans' drive to curtail abortion, saying the government should not be "telling women what to do with their bodies."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The crowd extended far beyond the Ellipse, across the Mall and all the way up to the iconic Washington Monument obelisk.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although there is almost a week to go, the Harris campaign cast the speech as a "closing argument" – a nod to her career as a prosecutor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think of this as a cleansing for what happened on January 6," said Mitzi Maxwell, 69, who came from Florida with her mother to see "all the love and passion and excitement that she (Harris) has become known for."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some Harris supporters queued for more than seven hours before the speech, whose sheer scale and energy was a direct challenge to Trump, a politician who has always boasted about his ability to draw crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Harris spoke in Washington, Trump visited a heavily Hispanic city in Pennsylvania, two days after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comments about Puerto Rico drew outrage at the New York rally.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Ricans are the largest Hispanic group in Pennsylvania, the most crucial battleground state to win as it holds the highest number of Electoral College votes of the seven battleground states, according to the Census Bureau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I’d like to begin with a very, very simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans," Trump said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Premier League strugglers Southampton squeezed into the English League Cup quarter-finals when James Bree struck a late winner to down Championship side Stoke 3-2 on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And another Premier League team, Brentford, also survived a major scare against second-tier rivals, beating Sheffield Wednesday on penalties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At St Mary's, Southampton were sailing into the next round after Taylor Harwood-Bellis' header and Adam Armstrong's spot-kick inside 35 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But goals from Ashley Phillips and Tom Cannon threatened to force a penalty shoot-out until defender Bree rifled home from 25 yards with two minutes left on the clock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Southampton were fortunate to reach that stage still level as only a goal-line clearance from Yukinari Sugawara stopped Stoke substitute Million Manhoef completing the turnaround minutes earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saints boss Russell Martin, who was serving a touchline ban after collecting a third booking of the campaign, made six changes to the starting XI which began Saturday's 1-0 loss at Manchester City, leaving the team footing the table with a solitary point from nine outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the night's other encounter, Brentford were bossing the show against Sheffield Wednesday after taking the lead through Kevin Schade in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wednesday levelled shortly before the hour with their first effort on target through Djeidi Gassama's spectacular strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford could not find a winner in normal time with Mark Flekken their hero, the goalkeeper saving Liam Palmer's penalty to send the hosts through 5-4 after a 1-1 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went to the wrong side twice at the start of the shoot-out," commented Flekken. "That doesn't help your confidence in a shoot-out but luckily I saved the last one".
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Qatar's Akram Afif was named Asian Football Confederation men's player of the year on Tuesday, while Japan's Kiko Seike took home the women's award.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Afif led Qatar to the Asian Cup title at the start of the year, being named player of the tournament and winning the golden boot with eight goals – including a hat-trick against Jordan in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second time the 27-year-old had been named Asian player of the year. He also won the prize in 2019 after winning the Asian Cup with Qatar for the first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif, who had stints in Belgium and Spain earlier in his career, also led club side Al Sadd to a domestic double in Qatar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to thank my wife, teammates and all the national team coaches and administrative staff," he said at the AFC award ceremony in Seoul. "I will try my best to win this award for a third time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif became the third player to win the award more than once, following in the footsteps of Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata and Uzbekistan's Server Djeparov.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seike won the women's prize after scoring 20 goals to help Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies win the Japanese domestic title for a second straight year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Seike was also influential as Urawa won the Asian club title, and was part of the Japan squad that reached the quarter-finals at the Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very happy to receive this prestigious award," said Seike, who joined England's Brighton in July. "I will continue to do my best for my club, the national team and to raise the value of Asian football." (AFP)

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent

  <img alt="China-made Teslas will be taxed an addition 7.8 percent, Chinese car giant Geely faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776781_1_20241030075912.jpg&q=30" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commerce Ministry said China "does not approve of or accept" the move, according to Xinhua News Agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A ministry spokesperson added that Beijing has already appealed to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

    Israel faces backlash over UN agency ban

  <img alt="UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776747_1_20241029213623.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel faced an international backlash on Tuesday after its parliament approved a bill banning the main United Nations aid agency for the devastated Gaza Strip.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite global concerns, including from Israel's ally the United States, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to ban the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) from working in Israel and annexed east Jerusalem.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UNRWA has been operating in the Palestinian territories for more than seven decades, and is the largest aid provider in Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel controls all humanitarian aid shipments to Gaza, where its forces have been fighting Palestinian militant group Hamas for more than a year. It is unclear how the agency will continue to operate there, and aid groups have warned that there is no immediate replacement for UNRWA.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lawmakers also passed a measure prohibiting Israeli officials from working with UNRWA and its employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel says UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas and that the militant group siphons off aid and uses UN facilities to shield its activities, allegations denied by the UN agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and UNRWA, and Israel cannot put up with it," lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said in parliament as he presented the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several of Israel's Western allies voiced disquiet at the ban, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying Britain was "gravely concerned."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany, which has been a staunch defender of Israel's security, warned it would "effectively make UNRWA's work in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem impossible... jeopardising vital humanitarian aid for millions of people."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   James Elder, a spokesperson for the UN children's agency UNICEF, said the suspension of UNRWA's work “would likely see the collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said UNICEF “would become effectively unable to distribute lifesaving supplies" such as vaccines, winter clothes, hygiene kits, health kits, water, and ready-to-use therapeutic food to combat malnutrition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   UN chief Antonio Guterres said the Israeli law could have "devastating consequences" if implemented, while UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini warned that the vote "sets a dangerous precedent."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on social media that Israel was "ready" to continue providing aid to Gaza "in a way that does not threaten Israel's security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ban comes as fighting rages in Gaza and Lebanon, where a second full-scale front opened last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. Around 90 percent of the population of 2.3 million have been displaced from their homes, often multiple times. (AP/AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate and US Vice President Kamala Harris will urge Americans to turn the page on Donald Trump as she delivers her closing election argument on Tuesday on the spot where her Republican rival rallied supporters before the January 6, 2021 US Capitol attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With polls in a dead heat one week before Election Day, Harris’ campaign said she chose the symbolic site to push her case that the Republican former president is a threat to American democracy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said in a statement that the former prosecutor would deliver a "major closing argument" and "make the case that it is time to turn the page on Trump and chart a new way forward.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A senior campaign official said Harris will also deliver an "optimistic and hopeful" message, amid rumblings in the party that she is focusing too much on Trump and not enough on her own policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harris will address some 20,000 people on the Ellipse, a park outside the White House where Trump delivered a fiery speech in which he ramped up his false claims that he won the 2020 election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump supporters then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, in an assault that left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Trump, who, at 78, is the oldest presidential candidate in US history, will be trying to take the sting out of Harris' big event by delivering remarks at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will then rally in blue-collar Allentown in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump gave his closing arguments at a mass rally at New York's Madison Square Garden at the weekend, where some of the other speakers used language widely condemned as racist and sexist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both candidates will keep up a punishing schedule in the final days until November 5, sometimes hitting three or more states in one day. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nato and South Korea have expressed alarm that North Korean troops could soon be joining Moscow's side in the Ukraine-Russia war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato said on Monday thousands of North Korean troops were moving toward the front line, a development which has prompted Kyiv to call for more weapons and an international plan to keep those troops at bay.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Western leaders said North Korea has sent some 10,000 soldiers – up from an estimate of 3,000 troops last Wednesday – to help Russia’s military campaign, and warned that its involvement in a European war could also unsettle relations in the Indo-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had talked with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and told him that 3,000 North Korean soldiers are already at military bases close to the Ukranian front line, and that he expects that deployment to increase to 12,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This war is becoming internationalised, extending beyond two countries," Zelenskiy said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation," Zelensky said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yoon told Zelensky that if North Korea receives aid from Russia and is able to glean military experience and knowledge from its involvement in the war, it would pose a "great threat" to South Korea's security, his office said.

   <br/>
   South Korea has said it may start supplying weapons to Ukraine if North Korean troops joined Russia's war. Neither Putin nor Pyongyang has denied North Korean troops are in Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Moscow said on Tuesday it had seized the war-battered mining town of Selydove in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv's forces are buckling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Moscow also said it had wrested control of the nearby villages of Bogoyavlenka, Girnyk and Katerynivka, also in the Donetsk region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed was formally part of Russia in late 2022, the year Moscow started the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The gains announced by Moscow on Tuesday are just the latest in a string of Russian advances that have gained momentum since February with the collapse of Ukraine's defences in the stronghold town of Avdiivka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the same time, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui arrived in Russia's far east on Tuesday on her way to Moscow, Russian state media said. Russian state news agencies said it was not clear who Choe, making her second visit in six weeks, would meet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin had no plans to meet her. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain's Carlos Alcaraz opened his campaign at the Paris Masters on Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Chilean Nicolas Jarry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After receiving a bye through the first round, Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead in his round of 32 match but was reigned back in by Jarry, before eventually claiming the first set 7-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Alcaraz was in commanding form in the second set, giving his Chilean opponent only one game as he raced to victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been two years since I have won a match here in Paris – so every time that I keep going is a gift for me," said the 21-year-old Spaniard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really happy to get through the opening set, it was really important for me to come into the second with more confidence," he added. "I need time to get used to the speed of the court."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz is now the heavy favourite to win his first title on the hard court at Bercy Arena after Italian world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament earlier on Tuesday due to an intestinal virus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will face either Frenchman Ugo Humbert or American Marcos Giron in the round of 16. (AFP)

    Shenzhou-19 blasts off for Tiangong space station

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Three Chinese astronauts including the country's only woman spaceflight engineer blasted off on a "dream" mission to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Tiangong team will carry out experiments with an eye to the space programme's ambitious goal of placing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 and eventually constructing a lunar base.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spacecraft Shenzhou-19 and its three crew lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 4.27am, according to state media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The space agency deemed the launch a "complete success", Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "During the Shenzhou-19 flight ... 86 space sci-tech experiments will be carried out in the fields of space life sciences, microgravity physics, materials, medicine, new technologies," Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), said in a press conference on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of these experiments is expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which China hopes to complete by 2035, as it would in theory be more convenient than transporting building materials from Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bricks will be sent in a separate uncrewed cargo spaceflight to the Shenzhou-19 crew next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the crew on the Shenzhou-19 is Wang Haoze, 34, who is China's only female spaceflight engineer, according to the CMSA. She is the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like everyone else, I dream of going to the space station to have a look," Wang told a media gathering on Tuesday alongside her fellow crew members.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to meticulously complete each task and protect our home in space," she said. "I also want to travel in deep space and wave at the stars."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Headed by Cai Xuzhe, the team will return to Earth in late April or early May next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cai, a 48-year-old former air force pilot, brings experience from a previous stint aboard Tiangong as part of the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having been selected for the new crew, taking on a new role, facing new tasks and new challenges, I feel the honour of my mission with a great responsibility," said Cai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The crew currently aboard the Tiangong space station is scheduled to return to Earth on November 4 after completing handover procedures with the incoming astronauts, CMSA’s Lin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of China's space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years as China built and began operating its "Tiangong" space station, officially completed in November 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crewed by teams of three astronauts that are rotated every six months, Tiangong is the programme's crown jewel. Beijing says it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq pushed to a record high on Tuesday despite a pullback in the Dow, as markets greeted a series of earnings from technology heavyweights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Google parent Alphabet rose in after-hours trading following its earnings report, which will be succeeded later this week by releases from Apple, Microsoft and others.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tech stocks are catching a bid," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that there has been "more good news than bad" today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.8 percent at 18,712,
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones declined 0.4 percent to 42,233, while the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent at 5,832.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hogan pointed to another decline in oil prices as supportive of stocks and noted that US Treasury bond yields were stable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month, another positive for stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Ford fell 8.4 percent after reporting solid third-quarter earnings, but lowering some of its full-year projections, implying a weaker fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Boeing shot up 1.5 percent after it announced it will raise more than initially expected from a new stock offering as it seeks to offset crushing production woes and a major strike. The aerospace giant now expects to raise at least US$21 billion from the campaign. (AFP)

  <img alt="Jamshid Sharmahd was a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident. File Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776746_1_20241029211738.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany and the European Union on Tuesday strongly condemned Iran's execution of a 69-year-old German-Iranian dissident after years behind bars and warned they were considering retaliatory measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Jamshid Sharmahd's execution on Monday a "scandal" and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned Iran's "inhumane regime" of "serious consequences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi doubled down and poured scorn on her comments, writing on X that "a German passport does not provide impunity to anyone, let alone a terrorist criminal".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin summoned Iran's charge d'affaires to "convey its strong protest" at the execution. The German ambassador in Tehran also protested to the Iranian foreign ministry and was then recalled to Berlin for consultations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Berlin "reserved the right to take further measures", the foreign ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc condemned Sharmahd's "killing in the strongest possible terms" and was also "considering measures in response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A European Commission spokeswoman told reporters that "any measures" could be taken against Iran and that they "have to be discussed with all member states".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd, a German citizen of Iranian descent and a US resident, was a software engineer who had worked and written for an Iranian opposition group's website based abroad that strongly criticised the Islamic republic's leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was seized by Iranian authorities in 2020 while travelling through the United Arab Emirates, according to his family.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran accused him of having played a role in a deadly 2008 mosque bombing. He was sentenced to death in February 2023 for the capital offence of "corruption on Earth".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Iranian judiciary's Mizan website said on Monday that "the death sentence of Jamshid Sharmahd... was carried out this morning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His family have always vehemently protested his innocence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle said on X she was waiting for the German and US governments to provide "concrete proof" that her father had been killed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If so, she said, his body should be brought home "immediately" and the Iranian government should face "severe punishment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A German foreign ministry source said that Baerbock had spoken to Gazelle Sharmahd on Monday "and expressed condolences on behalf of the German government". (AFP)

   The European Commission on Tuesday said it had finalised discussions with Britain on an agreement that would allow both sides to cooperate directly in antitrust investigations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement is the first that would allow national competition authorities from EU countries to cooperate directly with a competition authority outside the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which comes into force after both the EU and Britain have finalised their ratification procedures, will set out that important antitrust and merger investigations are brought to each other's attention, the commission said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will also allow the coordination of investigations when necessary and set out the principles of cooperation, to avoid conflicts between jurisdictions. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Steve Bannon, a prominent right-wing figure and former senior advisor to Donald Trump, was released from prison early on Tuesday after spending nearly four months behind bars and just a week ahead of the US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon left a federal prison in Connecticut where he was serving time for a contempt of Congress conviction, several US media outlets reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not broken, I'm empowered," the 70-year-old told the New York Times outside the prison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon was convicted of defying a subpoena to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When he entered prison on July 1, he defiantly said he was "proud" to serve time "if it's what it takes to stand up to Joe Biden."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much has changed in US politics since then, with Biden dropping out of the race and Kamala Harris replacing him as the Democratic nominee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bannon played a senior role in Trump's 2016 campaign and later served in the White House as chief strategist, leaving after seven months reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Though he no longer works officially for ex-president, he has continued to use his influence to get him back in the White House, mainly through his podcast "The War Room."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors for the construction of a border wall with Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a man on suspicion of murder after a 25-year-old woman's body was found in a shallow beach at the bottom of Waterfall Bay in Aberdeen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The male suspect's wife was also arrested for allegedly aiding an offender.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force said it had received a report at around 7:30am on Monday. Emergency personnel rushed to the scene, but the woman was pronounced dead on site.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a press briefing, superintendent Sin Kwok-ming said the victim was a domestic helper from Southeast Asia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She had injuries on the back of the head and forehead, but an autopsy will determine her exact cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Initial evidence suggested the woman arrived at the scene with the male suspect in a taxi late on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The man then left alone about 30 to 40 minutes later, before heading to the mainland with his wife.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police eventually locked down their identities and arrested them when they returned to the city on Tuesday afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin also explained why the case wasn't classified as a murder at the beginning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The arrested man's actions raise a lot of questions, like why the police weren't called right away and why he left Hong Kong immediately afterwards," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some evidence has also gone missing for no good reason. All these factors lead us to believe that the woman's death wasn't due to natural reasons."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sin added the victim had known the man for some time, but was not employed by the suspect, a foreign national holding a Hong Kong identity card.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Efforts by Radio Television Hong Kong to promote its programmes are starting to bear fruit, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said on Tuesday as he noted a gradual shift in the way people receive their content.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legislative Council panel meeting, several legislators raised concerns about the public broadcaster's performance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michael Luk of the Federation of Trade Unions praised the quality of RTHK programmes in recent years, but felt the organisation could do more to expand its reach.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course we understand RTHK is not a commercial radio or television station. But when it comes to delivering messages to a mass audience, it cannot be too nonchalant towards viewership and listenership," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Cheung said RTHK has already launched a promotional campaign, citing both outdoor and online advertisements which he said were effective.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giving the Paris Olympics and Paralympics as examples, he revealed the hit rates and viewership of RTHK's streaming platforms doubled during that period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung noticed a fundamental change in the media consumption pattern, saying many people are no longer glued to their TV sets, and instead rely on mobile devices for information.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the RTHK website, every day we're seeing 3.8 million real-time streams, while our programmes are played 620,000 times and the website is accessed 500,000 times. We also record about 1.5 million daily views at our news website," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The figures, he believed, are proof the broadcaster's programmes can arouse interest among the Hong Kong audience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Liberal Party’s Peter Shiu suggested RTHK team up with schools to produce content which educate students on national policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau pledged to take his recommendation into account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "RTHK has a strong focus on national education for youth and promoting Chinese culture. We will do more and consider lawmakers' ideas for raising national awareness and education," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yau added RTHK will spare no effort to promote and broadcast the 15th National Games, scheduled for November next year. Hong Kong will host eight competitive events, including track cycling, fencing and golf.

    Smart food waste bins to debut in Tai Hang

  <img alt="Five smart recycling bins will be set up in Tai Hang from November to collect food waste round the clock.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A project that encourages residents to recycle their food waste will soon kick off in Tai Hang, with organisers setting up smart bins in the neighbourhood with an expected reach of up to 1,000 households.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sponsored by the government’s Environment and Conservation Fund, the initiative will focus on 40 older single-block buildings and so called three-nil buildings – blocks that lack a residents’ organisation, owners corporation or property management – in the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five bins, sporting a purple colour scheme, will be set up in Tai Hang from November and will serve the community there until September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They also have features such as fill-level detection and auto-deodorisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The New People's Party’s Jeff Wong, who is helping to coordinate the project, said organisers will also set up a street station there to collect food waste twice a week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are aiming for 700 to 1,000 households to use our scheme or use our recycling system,” he said after attending the scheme’s opening ceremony on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Later on, we will organise a lot of activities and events such as talks or workshops to educate the residents to use our recycling system,” he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As part of a pilot scheme last December, authorities installed smart food waste recycling bins at a number of private housing estates that were chosen through an application process.
