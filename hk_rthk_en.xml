<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes across Syria as its troops advanced deeper into the country, and the Israeli defence minister announced his country's forces had destroyed Syria’s navy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it conducted about 480 strikes over the past 48 hours on strategic military targets in Syria, days after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (army) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements," the military said in a statement, adding that the targets included 15 naval vessels, anti-aircraft batteries and weapons production sites in several cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence officials said Israeli ships struck two Syrian naval facilities during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has acknowledged pushing into a buffer zone inside Syria following the overthrow of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it remained unclear if Israeli soldiers had gone beyond that area, which was established more than 50 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel denied it was advancing on the Syrian capital of Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel intended to establish a demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a navy base in Haifa, Katz said the army would create a “defence zone free of weapons and terrorist threats in southern Syria, without a permanent Israeli presence, in order to prevent terrorism in Syria from taking root.” (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The project director of Kai Tak Sports Park on Wednesday said the venue is well-positioned to showcase Hong Kong as a host city for mega events.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony announcing an exclusive partnership with HSBC, John Sharkey also unveiled plans to build the first outdoor AirBadminton court at a mall at the sports park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharkey said major facilities at the venue will be completed by the end of this year, and test events have been progressing well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe that KTSB [Kai Tak Sports Park] will further leverage Hong Kong's advantages as a host city, providing more citizens with the opportunity to experience the resilience of our athletes first hand,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we will nurture the next generation's involvement in sports, allowing them to showcase their talents on an international stage that they can be proud to call their home.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, Luanne Lim, said she thinks the partnership will elevate Hong Kong's profile as a global sports hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through this partnership, we want to support this active lifestyle by making recreational and sporting activities available to everyone, every day,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sports unites us and brings people together, not just locally but across borders and across cultures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim added the bank will open a new branch at the sports park to serve the local community and international visitors.

    Hard to set sexual abuse allegation time frame: govt

<img alt="Chris Sun stressed it would be hard to a set time frame for announcements because each alleged case is different." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783014_1_20241211161311.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said on Wednesday that it would be rather difficult to set a time frame as to how quickly the authorities should make public allegations of sexual abuse against residents of care homes for disabled people.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a full council meeting in the legislature, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien noted that it took officials two months to announce an alleged incident earlier this year, and said he found it unacceptable that there is no set criteria for revealing such suspected incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, Sun said the circumstances of each alleged incident are always different and if a time frame is set that is too short, this might cause the mishandling of cases, adding that if the time frame was too long, people might question why the announcement did not come sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for us to set a fixed time frame for announcements, and we have to take into consideration the unique nature of every such incident," he told lawmakers during a Q&A session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do have to take care of the emotions of the victims as well as their family members, and we will try to announce such incidents as early as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In October, officials amended a code of practice for care homes for the disabled, including setting out policies on installing CCTV and reviewing the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who's a social worker by trade, pointed out that while most care homes have installed surveillance cameras, they often are too understaffed to check the footage.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Sun said there could be "riskier" periods such as when there are fewer people at the homes at weekends, and staff could review footage of those periods more regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said in the long run, officials hope artificial intelligence can help with such monitoring work.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's superstar swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Wednesday advanced to the 100m freestyle semi-finals at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, in one of her last races before taking a break to ponder her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her time of 52.12 seconds topped her heat, and was good for second overall behind American Gretchen Walsh, who clocked a 51.64-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, was second at the first turn in the short course race and overtook Briton Freya Andersen shortly afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow SAR swimmer Li Sum-yiu, 15, was unable to advance after finishing eighth in the same heat with a time of 53.41 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals are due to begin at 0:48am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200m freestyle title in Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time Olympic medallist for Hong Kong, China recently announced that she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Huangmaohai Sea-Crossing Passage, connecting Zhuhai and Jiangmen, officially opened on Wednesday, and it is expected the link will boost travel across the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  The 31-kilometre link is the western extension of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and starts in Pingsha Town while ending in Taishan City's Doushan Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project consists of two main bridges - Huangmaohai Bridge and Gaolan Port Bridge, two tunnels, four interchanges and one service area.
  <br>
  <br>
  With its commencement, the travel time between Zhuhai and Jiangmen is reduced from more than one hour to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that some drivers from different GBA cities, including Zhuhai, Jiangmen and Macau, waited to get a glimpse of the link.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction of the bridge began in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the world's longest three-tower cable-stayed highway design bridge.

<img alt="InvestHK and Deloitte say Hong Kong can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783008_1_20241211160129.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the potential to become a green technology hub, according to a study conducted by the government’s investment promotion agency and accounting firm Deloitte.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said on Wednesday that the green technology industry is worth trillions of dollars, but 41 percent of climate problems are still waiting to be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This creates enormous business opportunities for the investors and also the tech innovators, as one way to interpret this number is that 41 percent of the problems currently do not have an available solution," said King Leung, InvestHK's Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The study said the city can help China achieve carbon neutrality through five sectors, including transport, construction and waste management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohit Grover, the lead partner for sustainability and climate at Deloitte's Hong Kong branch, said the SAR can assist Chinese electric car companies with expanding their business worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For Chinese enterprises, Hong Kong will be used as one of the global hubs to globalise their operations and to raise capital through the exchange. We already see a lot of shift happening from Western brands to Chinese brands for the electric vehicles (EV) that we see on the road," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for some of the technology innovation around various aspects of battery production or EV production, I think those start-ups are also being present in Hong Kong, which will get a bigger access to the [global] market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For construction, Leung suggested the adoption of glass materials for insulation and generating solar power to lower energy consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "90 percent of all the electricity consumed in Hong Kong goes to buildings. We have 8,000 skyscrapers, which is the most in a single city in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that China is leading the world in green building technology patents, and Hong Kong's positioning as an international financial centre can help such companies to showcase their abilities and therefore expand to global markets through the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of waste management, Grover said a behavioural change among residents of Hong Kong will be crucial.

    'Mega events in first half drew HK$2.4bn in spending'

<img alt="Rosanna Law noted that RTHK has produced a programme providing updates on local mega events. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782995_1_20241211142635.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that mega events in the first half of the year had attracted an estimated 550,000 visitors, who spent around HK$2.4 billion and added about HK$1.4 billion in value to the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law said there were 110 mega events in the first six months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 70 of them were conventions and exhibitions as well as cultural, arts and creative events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Business and Professionals Alliance lawmaker, Jeffrey Lam, asked the government how it could further enhance the attractiveness of mega-events and boost their economic benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said one of the administration's key purposes of compiling a Hong Kong mega event calendar in advance, is to allow the public and tourists to learn about them early.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[This can] foster collaboration between different industries and mega events, and facilitate the industries of tourism, hotel and catering to plan and design promotional activities and tourism products early," she wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said RTHK had produced a programme called "Mega Events Mega Hong Kong", which gives daily updates on what's happening through different media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Information Services Department has used its website and social media platforms, such as Xiaohongshu, for promotion, while inviting media from the mainland and overseas to cover the city's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said with HK$100 million in this year's budget earmarked for boosting mega-event promotion over the next three years, officials will review and optimise resources to enhance publicity efforts, bearing in mind ongoing developments and mega-event planning updates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

    'Passengers won't pay for transition to e-buses'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Wednesday that he believes the additional costs incurred in Hong Kong's planned transition to electric buses will not be passed on to passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, the government plans to subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aim is for the SAR to achieve carbon neutrality, with all franchised buses and taxis to be zero emission vehicles by 2050.
  <br>
  <br>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Tse said the subsidy is sufficient to cover the extra costs that will be incurred by bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, electric double decker buses were much more expensive than regular ones, double the price of a normal bus. Regular buses cost about 200 million dollars, and electric ones cost 400 to 500 million dollars each. As technology advances, in recent months we have seen the price has reduced drastically. But they still cost hundreds of millions of dollars each," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government will offer subsidies that cover the additional costs that are incurred from changing to electric buses. In that way, companies won't have to pass the additional costs incurred on to passengers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also plans to offer 500 more high-speed charging stations for taxis by the end of 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the government will encourage petrol stations to build charging spots and offer discounts to taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, Wong Yu-ting, chairman of the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, questioned whether the government will be able to achieve all these goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he made an application to install charging spots in Tsing Yi around a year ago, but this has yet to be approved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You said more charging stations will be available by the end of 2027, it's so vague. Shouldn't you talk about your goal for each year? It would be better. Or you can say by which month a certain number of charging spots will be available. In this way, it's more concrete," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Ip, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said he welcomes the government's plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should provide more high-speed charging spots, to benefit both the transport industry and the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip said the government should also consider promoting the use of hydrogen vehicles.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's former defence minister tried to kill himself shortly before he was formally arrested over his role in this month's martial law operation, a senior prisons official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament but was forced to rescind the decree hours later after lawmakers voted it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence minister Kim Yong-hyun resigned last Thursday and was formally arrested on Tuesday on charges including "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  During a parliamentary hearing, the commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service said the former minister tried to kill himself minutes before his arrest was announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before midnight, "former Minister of Defence Kim Yong-hyun attempted suicide at the Seoul Dongbu Detention Center," said Shin Yong-hae.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding that he received the report Wednesday morning, Shin said Kim had tried to kill himself in the toilet using a string from his clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A control room staff member intervened, and when they opened the door, he immediately gave up the attempt," said Shin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shin added that Kim was now under protection in a secure cell and in good health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The medical examination results indicate that the inmate's health status is good without any abnormalities, and he is currently living a normal life in the facility," the justice ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim had issued an apology on Tuesday, saying through his lawyers that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  He "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties". (AFP)

    Private school accused of not refunding debentures

<img alt="The Education Bureau says it has been monitoring Han Academy’s management and financial situation. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782961_2_20241211165626.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group of parents have accused private school Han Academy of failing to refund debentures as promised after their children left the school.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Wong Chuk Hang institution's website, parents who enrol their children from the 2020-21 academic year must join a capital contribution scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the options is a debenture of HK$600,000. HK$45,000 is deducted every year and the remaining amount can be refunded when the student leaves the school.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received complaints from 11 parents, involving about HK$5.8 million. The force has listed the matter as a request for police investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Education Bureau said it has instructed the school to suspend its capital contribution scheme and establish an emergency response plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A statement added that any individual fundraising scheme by private schools has to be vetted and approved by the bureau. So far 23 schools have made such applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Secretary for Education Christine Choi pointed out the vetting mechanism was not in place when Han Academy opened in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The school was established in 2017 and back then we didn't have the vetting mechanism. Since the mechanism was set up in August 2023, we have been reviewing its additional charges," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi added the bureau has demanded the school stop collecting additional fees from parents after realising it has run into financial trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also revealed more than 100 students are currently enrolled at the academy, and the bureau will make sure it maintains its teaching quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung said he has received feedback from more than 50 parents who allege they haven't had their money back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said they are worried about the school's financial situation and that it might close down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The parents also have heard that the school's owner intends to wind up the school through legal means due to the ongoing unpaid rent... A couple of days ago the school also held a meeting with the parents and announced that they are in debt of HK$100 million," he told RTHK.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that Hong Kong will continue to make use of its strengths in the fields of aviation and cargo to contribute to the development of an international logistics hub in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officiating at the second Business Conference on Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Development, Lee said the territory will collaborate with other cities in the region to build a comprehensive and modern transport system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will make use of Hong Kong's professional marine services, and cooperate with the mainland and Macau to increase the competitiveness of the Greater Bay Area's port clusters. As for aviation, Hong Kong is developing intermodal cargo‑transhipment with Dongguan, and we have brought forward the development of the Hong Kong International Airport Dongguan Logistics Park," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has also recently signed a shares acquisition agreement with Zhuhai Airport, which strengthens the foundation of passenger services between Beijing, Zhuhai and Hong Kong," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said the "one-hour living circle" in the Greater Bay Area has showcased the development results of the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong citizens going north to spend, and mainland citizens coming south to travel and shop has become the norm. This has enhanced exchanges among Hong Kong and the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government's earlier resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme has allowed more than ten million Shenzhen residents to enter Hong Kong freely, which further injects strong forces towards Hong Kong's tourism, retail and catering industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that his Policy Address in October included various measures to promote development in the area, including regarding the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and fostering connections in areas such as logistics and aviation qualifications.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea is in "chaos" after President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law, North Korean state media said on Wednesday in its first comments on the political upheaval.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule on Tuesday last week and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shocking incident of the puppet Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing impeachment and a governance crisis, suddenly declaring a martial law decree and unhesitatingly wielding the guns and knives of its fascist dictatorship wrought chaos across South Korea," North Korean state media said in a commentary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The international community is sternly watching, with assessments that the martial law incident exposed vulnerabilities in South Korean society," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Commentators described Yoon's abrupt declaration of martial law as a desperate move and that Yoon Suk Yeol's political life could face an early end."
  <br>
  <br>
  In declaring martial law on December 3, Yoon said it would safeguard South Korea "from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between the two Koreas have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also has been bombarding the South with trash-carrying balloons since May, in what it says is retaliation for anti-Pyongyang propaganda missives sent North by activists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was arrested on Tuesday, has been accused by opposition lawmakers of calling for strikes on sites from which North Korea was launching balloons carrying trash, an order reportedly refused by his subordinates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition plans to bring another motion to impeach Yoon to a vote on Saturday. (AFP)

<img alt="Matt Coulson, executive director of Kids4Kids, says the charity will use the funds from OSC to support youths. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782953_1_20241211095458.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity dedicated to empower young people has strived to help low-resourced teenagers become better problem-solvers and be more resilient.
 <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2008, Kids4Kids has been working with children from less advantaged backgrounds on a number of issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-profit, which is among the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), has helped more than 35,000 pupils and involved over 30,000 volunteers over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt Coulson, the organisation's executive director, said the initiative funded by the annual drive works with individuals aged between 12 and 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This particular project basically works with low-resourced kids and works on their life skills, works on their integration, works on developing their sense of well-being, their sense of importance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, Coulson said, is to encourage young people use their creativity to solve problems, be engaged with their community, and develop resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coulson said the organisation will use the funds from OSC to support youths in charting their own paths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to be spending it to develop some really particular psychological support structure systems for young people, and encouraging them along the journey of entrepreneurship, to allow them to explore a future that isn't just in catering, or isn't just in food services, but it could be anything," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entrepreneurial journey we encourage the kids to go on is all around developing solutions to UNSDG (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals) problems, trying to create solutions for their communities that really deeply engage in positive change making."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

  Spelling out his vision on RTHK programme Overview Policy, John Lee reiterated the main objective of reforming the healthcare system is to ensure efficient division of work among the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health and the Primary Healthcare Commission, which was set up in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make primary healthcare accessible for everyone in the community. People need to take good care of themselves, especially before they fall ill so they don't have to rely on treatment. The basis is to have everyone protect their own health on a day-to-day basis," Lee explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal, the chief executive stated, is to establish Hong Kong's own drug regulator and speed up registration of new pharmaceutical products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, a drug can only be submitted for approval after it has been registered in at least two reference jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the aim is to substitute part of that requirement with approved clinical trials, where collaboration with the mainland is essential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have data from 7.5 million patients. But if we can utilise the data from 1.4 billion people on the mainland, or even just 78 to 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, then the clinical trials will become a lot more effective," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader also stressed that careful planning is needed when establishing a third medical school in the city, to make sure it does not take away students or resources with the two existing institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only around 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the ratio of 2.5 in other advanced economies. There's a lot of catching up to do, and with the current limited intake quota for medical students it's very important to set up a third medical school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time I don't want these institutions to compete against each other for students. So right now the idea is to let two medical schools focus on teaching, while the third can focus on research and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee confirmed multiple universities have expressed interest to take up the initiative, and a working group is now assessing which one is the most suitable candidate and meets all of the Medical Council's requirements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid got their European Champions League title defence back up and running after coming through a tough battle to win 3-2 at Atalanta.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were just enough for Madrid to triumph in a red-hot atmosphere in Bergamo and move up to nine points from six matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side would have been at risk of dropping out of the play-off places but came through a tough test at Serie A leaders Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The away side are now three points from the top eight positions which give direct qualification for the last 16 with two matches remaining in their league campaign and a round of fixtures coming up on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid inflicted on Atalanta a first defeat in this year's revamped competition and are now only two points behind Gian Piero Gasperini's ambitious team who performed well against 15-time European champions Madrid but now sit ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously we're a little disappointed, but we're learning so much from these matches," Gasperini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing tiny details, but we played with heart against great champions," he added. "We were defeated in result, but not in performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atalanta scored through a Charles De Ketelaere penalty which levelled Mbappé's opener in first-half stoppage time and a fine Ademola Lookman strike in the 65th minute which put the hosts back in the match after Vinicius and Bellingham's quickfire goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts even came to within inches of snatching a dramatic draw deep in added time when substitute Retegui somehow shot over Lookman's fizzing cross from from practically on the goalline. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Champions League group phase leaders Liverpool virtually sealed a place in the last 16 with a tight 1-0 victory at Girona after Mohamed Salah struck from the penalty spot.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool have made a stunning start in the competition under coach Arne Slot, winning all six of their matches to move provisionally five points clear of second-placed Inter Milan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English giants, six-time winners of the competition, were given a tough night by Champions League debutants Girona, who fell to a fifth defeat and are on the verge of elimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing in the top eight will avoid an extra round of play-off matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me about all six games, I'm really pleased with all the results – but I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight," Slot told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better but then I'm trying to be positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot started fit-again goalkeeper Alisson Becker after a two-month injury lay-off and the Brazilian showed no sign of rust on a busy night.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their Merseyside derby clash at Everton was called off because of a storm at the weekend, Slot was able to pick a fresh side, going with arguably his strongest available team to try and assure a top eight finish as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcomers Girona, who lost several key players in the summer and are still rebuilding, opted for Arnaut Danjuma in attack with support from spritely duo Bryan Gil and Yaser Asprilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool pinned the hosts back in the first 10 minutes and Girona stopper Paulo Gazzaniga pushed away a Joe Gomez header.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that Michel Sanchez's Girona found their footing on a chilly night at their sold-out Montilivi stadium, reduced to under 10,000 capacity due to UEFA regulations, and they began to put Alisson to the test. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday as markets paused from a post-election rally, while Google parent Alphabet surged on what it called a "major" technology announcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  After winning numerous records in the weeks since the November 5 presidential election, US stocks have fallen the last two days amid caution ahead of key inflation data.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Alphabet jumped 5.3 percent after Google showed off a new quantum computing chip that it described as a significant breakthrough in the field that it said could lead to advances in drug discovery, fusion energy and other areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.4 percent at 44.247.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent to 6,034, while the tech-rich Nasdaq also fell 0.3 percent to 19,687.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses come ahead of Thursday's consumer price index, which will be closely scrutinised by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance soared 17.7 percent following reports that it could be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing jumped 4.5 percent as it announced it was resuming production at two Seattle-area plants that had been shuttered for nearly three months due to a labour strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle slumped 6.7 percent after reporting lower-than-expected profits despite "extraordinary" growth in the artificial intelligence segment of the company's infrastructure business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group surged 13.2 percent as it unveiled a medium-term outlook that promised "at least" US$10 earnings per share in 2027. In 2023, the airline company earned US1.83 per share. (AFP)

    French Socialists repeat call for left-wing PM

<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday gathered leaders of all parties – except the far right and the far left – for talks about forming a government, the first time under the hung parliament left by June's election that mainstream parties had sat down together.
 <br>
  <br>
  The meeting included moderate left-wing leaders willing to compromise to break the political impasse, distancing themselves from the anti-capitalist France Unbowed, which declined to join them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Socialists are seen as likely kingmakers in Macron's bid to form a new government, with sufficient parliamentary support to make sure it survives, unlike the last cabinet under veteran conservative Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have come to say we are ready to have a left-wing prime minister, but one who is open to compromise," Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure told reporters on his way into the Winter Garden of the president's Elysee Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists, while sticking to their calls for a new prime minister to hail from the left, have shifted since Barnier's government was toppled in a vote of no-confidence last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, they no longer insist on Macron naming a prime minister whom France Unbowed would approve of, saying France cannot remain rudderless.
  <br>
  <br>
  A source in Macron's entourage declined to say whether he would indeed name a prime minister from the left, but did say entrenched positions had begun to shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Socialists say Macron's decision not to invite Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) opens space for cooperation. But Green leader Marine Tondelier said the president would also have to compromise, adding "We've come to hear what concessions Macron is willing to make".
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Pen said she had not wanted an invitation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The president knows that, so he didn't invite the RN to the party where the jobs will be divided up." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said it is time to promote the use of electric vehicles, given the drop in prices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the Green Transformation Roadmap of Public Buses and Taxis, Tse said the government will subsidise the purchase of 600 electric buses and 3,000 electric taxis, with invitation letters to be sent to those eligible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said he believes the incentives will be sufficient to attract operators to opt for electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the prices are coming down very quickly, I believe very soon, electric vehicles will be very competitive against the conventional vehicles. And therefore, the need for further subsidies in future, I believe, will diminish,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To achieve the aim of all franchised buses and taxis being zero emission vehicles by 2050, the minister said the authorities will review the process in 2027 and then every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citybus welcomed the government's plan and said it would buy 200 electric buses under the subsidy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator also said it would continue to expand its use of hydrogen buses, and stressed it was committed to achieving zero emission operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB, meanwhile, said it currently has more than 80 electric buses, and would consider buying more of them.

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who are deemed to have "behaved poorly" on Hong Kong-related issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington had grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously violated principles of international law and basic norms of international relations by imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who have behaved poorly on Hong Kong-related issues. We must emphasise that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. We urge the US side to genuinely respect China's sovereignty, Hong Kong's rule of law, and cease any form of interference in Hong Kong affairs," Mao said at a news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington had last month said it would impose fresh sanctions on Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the SAR's national security law following the jailing of 45 people for subversion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is recovering in an intensive-care unit after undergoing surgery for an intracranial hemorrhage, the Sirio-Libanes Hospital said in a statement on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The procedure was performed after the 79-year-old leader felt headaches doctors believed resulted from a fall at home in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital said Lula, who travelled from the capital Brasilia to be treated 1,000 kilometers south in Sao Paulo, is “well, under monitoring in an ICU bed” after the bleeding was drained.

  His doctors later said he was "stable" and should leave hospital next week.

  Lula canceled a trip to Russia for a Brics summit after the accident, his office said at the time. It left him with a cut visible on the back of his head, slightly above his neck. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in court in Tel Aviv on Tuesday to testify for the first time in his corruption case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu, who has repeatedly sought to delay his appearance in court, is the first sitting prime minister of Israel to face a criminal trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust in three separate cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several people, including anti-Netanyahu protesters and his supporters, gathered outside the court, while some right-wing lawmakers attended the session, which was held in an underground chamber for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time he physically appeared in court was in June 2023, before the war in Gaza began in October that year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down 0.5 percent at 20,311.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.6 percent at 3,422, while the Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.8 percent higher at 10,812.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Yeung, the chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy on Monday has sent a positive signal to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the market has been excited in the last 24 hours after the Politburo statement. But obviously, it's just a change of wording that creates a lot of imagination," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It basically implies that the central bank is willing to cut the interest rate more and to inject liquidity... From now towards the National People's Congress [meeting], the market will be expecting more consumption support in almost every holiday season."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said careful timing and execution are important given the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday rolled out a roadmap for Hong Kong to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with international standards.
 <br>
  <br>
  It says publicly accountable entities, including banks, security brokers and all regulated financial institutions, are required to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants will release local standards that align with ISSB Standards by the end of this year, with an effective date of August 1 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from January 1, 2025 major listed companies will be required to adopt a “comply or explain” approach for their disclosures related to the climate requirements in the ISSB Standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those listed in the Hang Seng Composite LargeCap Index will also have to disclose their compliance with climate requirements from January 1, 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed publicly accountable entities with an expected effective date of January 1, 2028, under a proportionate approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, certain non-listed financial institutions that carry significant weight will also need to adopt local standards no later than 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR is taking consistent steps to boost its competitiveness as a premier financial centre through observing international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, he added that the roadmap’s launch highlights the government's dedication to promoting green and sustainable financing and investment, while also laying out a clear framework on sustainability reporting for financial institutions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will travel to Beijing for his annual duty visit on Wednesday to meet senior officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will make a four-day visit to the capital to "brief state leaders on the latest economic, social and political situation in Hong Kong", a government statement said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining him on the trip are the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Carol Yip, and his private secretary Vicki Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Financial Secretary Paul Chan will take turns acting in the chief executive's position over the four-day period ending Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of the duty visit, a question and answer session with the chief executive and lawmakers in the legislature scheduled for Thursday has been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers will be notified by the secretariat when the session is rescheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Lee announced he would hold a Q&A session in Legco, with topics such as economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network to be included in the discussion.

    South Korea slaps travel bans on more top officials

<img alt="Protesters tear a banner representing the flag of the ruling People Power Party as they attend a rally calling for the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782840_1_20241210150302.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities banned more top officials from leaving the country on Tuesday in the wake of President Yoon Suk-yeol's bungled attempt to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A day after Yoon himself was hit with a travel ban, his party was forging a "resignation roadmap" that reportedly could see him step down in February or March before fresh elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon suspended civilian rule a week ago and sent special forces and helicopters to parliament, before lawmakers forced him to rescind the decree in a country assumed to be a stable democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are probing the president and a cabal of allies -- many from the same school -- for alleged insurrection over the sequence of extraordinary events.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Cho Ji-ho, commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, and two other top police officials became the latest to be banned from foreign travel, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already confined to South Korean territory are the former defence and interior ministers, martial law commander General Park An-su and defence counterintelligence commander Yeo In-hyung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Yong-hyun, the former defence minister, was detained on Sunday and late on Monday prosecutors filed a formal arrest warrant against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges included "engaging in critical duties during an insurrection" and "abuse of authority to obstruct the exercise of rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul court will hold a hearing later on Tuesday to rule on whether to issue the warrant for Kim, the first court decision to be made related to the martial law chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim issued contrite comments Tuesday saying that "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim "deeply apologised" to the South Korean people and said that his subordinates were "merely following my orders and fulfilling their assigned duties", in a statement made through his lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon narrowly survived an impeachment effort in parliament on Saturday as tens of thousands braved freezing temperatures to call for his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups held further candlelight vigils across the country on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motion failed after members of Yoon's own People Power Party (PPP) walked out of parliament, depriving it of the necessary two-thirds majority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PPP says that in exchange Yoon has agreed to hand power to the prime minister and party chief, prompting the opposition to accuse it of a "second coup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported on Tuesday that the PPP will announce a "resignation road map" soon in order to head off a new impeachment motion, which the opposition wants to put before lawmakers on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party's task force was also reportedly reviewing two options, including for Yoon to resign in February with an April election, or to step down in March with a vote in May. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has set a 2024 GDP growth target of around 5 percent. (Xinhua and agencies)

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 200 people in Haiti were killed in brutal weekend violence reportedly orchestrated against voodoo practitioners, with the government on Monday condemning a massacre of "unbearable cruelty".
 <br>
  <br>
  The killings in the capital Port-au-Prince were overseen by a powerful gang leader convinced that his son's illness was caused by followers of the religion, according to civil organisation the Committee for Peace and Development (CPD).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest act of extreme violence by powerful gangs that control most of the capital city in the Caribbean country mired for decades in political instability, natural disasters and other woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and voodoo practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of sending a bad spell on his son," a statement from the Haiti-based group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the "horrific" violence, which his spokesman said left at least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling the bloody episode an "act of barbarity, of unbearable cruelty," the office of Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime said "this monstrous crime constitutes a direct attack on humanity".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the CPD and UN said that the killings took place in the capital's western coastal neighborhood of Cite Soleil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gang's soldiers were responsible for identifying victims in their homes to take them to the chief's stronghold to be executed," the CPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reliable sources within the community report that more than a hundred people were massacred, their bodies mutilated and burned in the street," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haiti has suffered from decades of instability but the situation escalated in February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-prime minister Ariel Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs now control 80 percent of the city. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and UN, violence has continued to soar.

 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong on Tuesday said 10-minute limits placed on visits to the giant pandas An An and Ke Ke helped prevent overcrowding.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people flocked to the park when the pandas made their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd control measures were taken after considering the visitor experience and safety concerns. They're necessary because the exhibit can't hold too many people," Pong said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With regard to the 10-minute visiting time, we looked at other places and this isn't too short. Some places only allow visitors to stay for three or four minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong also said the public were able to meet the pandas sooner than originally expected, as the animals were adopting very well to their new habitat and are very energetic.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that twin panda cubs at the park are in good shape, with the heavier male starting to develop its baby teeth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair could be able to meet the public from around Lunar New Year, Pong said.

    West Ham beat Wolves to ease pressure on Lopetegui

<img alt="West Ham's Jarrod Bowen fights for the ball against Wolves' Toti Gomes. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782815_1_20241210105809.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jarrod Bowen eased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui as his superb strike sealed a vital 2-1 win that pushed Wolves manager Gary O'Neil closer to the sack on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a showdown dubbed "El Sackico" due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the futures of Lopetegui and O'Neil, it was the Hammers chief who earned some much-needed breathing space thanks to Bowen's moment of magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowen bagged a priceless winner in the second half at the London Stadium, just moments after Wolves defender Matt Doherty had cancelled out Tomas Soucek's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham's first win in three games lifted them nine points clear of the relegation zone, while second bottom Wolves remain four points adrift of safety after their 10th defeat in 15 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the aftermath of last week's 3-1 loss at Leicester, Lopetegui was reported to have survived a board meeting about his position.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes in the close-season, must build on this valuable victory over the team he managed in the 2022-23 season before he can fully relax.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't talk about noise, I talk about football. If you ask me about football, I will. A win is always good for me," Lopetegui said. "The fans have supported us a lot through the bad times. I'm happy for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil, who played for West Ham from 2011 to 2013, heard Wolves fans call for his dismissal during their 4-0 thrashing at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he will anxiously await the verdict from the Wolves board on his future, which looks bleak after the latest blow to Wolves' survival hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An awful lot of decisions went against us in a big game, big moments. You need some of them to go your way but they didn't," O'Neil said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not concerned," he added. "People above me are supportive, but the supporters want to be successful – I understand I have to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were rocked at the weekend by the news that their Jamaica striker Michail Antonio had been in a serious car crash that left him needing surgery on a lower limb fracture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old had to be cut out of his Ferrari following the accident, with Lopetegui admitting it was a "miracle" he survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't an easy week. We dedicate the victory to Michail," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hammers fans held a minute's applause for Antonio in the ninth minute to match his shirt number. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men's football team will kick off the final round of their campaign for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup when they travel to Singapore in March following Monday’s draw for qualification to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR were drawn in Group C, which also features India and Bangladesh. Only the winners from each of the six groups earn a spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will begin their qualifying campaign by playing Singapore away on March 25, and India on June 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  These qualifiers will be the final chance for 24 teams to secure the final six spots, with the SAR being drawn in a tight and extremely competitive group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore are currently ranked 161 in the world, and are also gearing up to take on Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste in the Asean Championships being played across Southeast Asia this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, India – who qualified for the 2023 edition of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar but finished bottom of their group – are ranked 127th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh, ranked 185th, has also shown rapid improvement in their level of play in recent times.

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.
  <br>

    Suspect in US insurance exec killing in custody: NYPD

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 26-year-old man was arrested Monday over the targeted killing of a health insurance executive on the streets of New York, with investigators charging him with possession of fake IDs and a gun.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators continued to interrogate Luigi Mangione in connection with last week's brazen murder, which triggered a nationwide manhunt and global headlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  He arrived at a Pennsylvania court wearing a dark sweatshirt on Monday evening and was led inside by Altoona police flanked by NYPD detectives where he was arraigned, broadcasters showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione is next due to appear in court on December 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said that murder charges in New York state would follow, telling a media briefing "we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have not confirmed reports the words "delay" and "deny" – language used by insurers to reject claims – were written on casings found at the scene, hinting at a possible political motive for the crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was apprehended by officers following a tip from staff at an Altoona McDonald's branch, where he was found wearing a mask and a beanie while using a laptop, and gave officers a fake ID, charging documents show.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then searched him and found what police called a "ghost gun" capable of firing 9MM rounds and equipped with a suppressor that could have been made on a 3D printer.
  <br>
  <br>
  When officers asked if he had been to New York recently, Mangione "became quiet and started to shake," according to the criminal complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fake IDs found was that used to check in to a Manhattan hostel ahead of the attack, discovered alongside a document that spoke to Mangione's "motivation and mindset", New York police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, studied at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, and had been living in Hawaii ahead of the killing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He matches the description of the identification we've been looking for. He's also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident," said New York mayor Eric Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police told reporters that Mangione possessed material that suggested he had "ill-will towards corporate America". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer will likely not play again in 2024, coach Vincent Kompany said ahead of Tuesday's clash with Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He's got a broken rib, which means he probably won't play again this year," Kompany said. "What's important is that it heals now – hopefully from the start of January we'll have him back, but for now it's too early."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kompany confirmed Neuer broke his rib in a collision with Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong on Tuesday, for which the goalie also picked up the first red card of his 866-game career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are missing several first-team players as an injury crisis sweeps through the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman, Alphonso Davies, Joao Palhinha, Serge Gnabry, Josip Stanisic, Hiroki Ito and Mathys Tel are all on the injured list, while back-up 'keeper Sven Ulreich is out for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing a lot of players, but I think we've come through well so far," Kompany said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's absence means Bayern's third-choice goalie, Daniel Peretz, will start between the sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israel goalkeeper will play his third game for Bayern having made his club debut off the bench after Neuer's sending off in the 1-0 German Cup last 16 loss to Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-time Champions League winners sit in 13th spot on the Champions League table after five matches, after three home wins and away losses to Barcelona and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Shakhtar would help Bayern's bid to finish in the top eight and avoid an additional playoff round. (AFP)

    2024 the hottest year on record: EU monitor

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 This year will be the world's warmest since records began, with extraordinarily high temperatures expected to persist into at least the first few months of 2025, European Union scientists said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) comes two weeks after UN climate talks yielded a US$300 billion deal to tackle climate change, a package that poorer countries blasted as insufficient to cover the soaring cost of climate-related disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S said data from January to November had confirmed 2024 is now certain to be the hottest year on record, and the first in which average global temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest year on record was 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Extreme weather has swept around the world in 2024, with severe drought hitting Italy and South America, fatal floods in Nepal, Sudan and Europe, heatwaves in Mexico, Mali and Saudi Arabia that killed thousands, and disastrous cyclones in the US and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientific studies have confirmed the fingerprints of human-caused climate change on all of these disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month ranked as the second-warmest November on record after November 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still in near-record high territory for global temperatures, and that's likely to stay at least for the next few months," Copernicus climate researcher Julien Nicolas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cutting emissions to net zero – as many governments have pledged to eventually do – will stop global warming from getting worse. Yet despite these green pledges, global CO2 emissions are set to hit a record high this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  C3S' records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Damascus stirred back to life on Monday at the start of a hopeful but uncertain era after rebels seized the capital and President Bashar al-Assad fled, following 13 years of civil war and more than 50 years of his family's rule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heavy traffic returned to the streets and people ventured out after a nighttime curfew, but most shops remained shut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rebels milled about in the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met overnight with Assad's Prime Minister Mohammed Jalali and Vice President Faisal Mekdad to discuss arrangements for a transitional government, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Jazeera television reported that the transitional authority would be headed by Mohamed Al-Bashir, who ran the administration in a small pocket of rebel-held territory before the 12-day lightning offensive that swept into Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's banks would reopen on Tuesday and staff had been asked to return to offices, according to a Syrian central bank source and two commercial bankers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's currency would continue to be used, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighters from the remote countryside milled about in the capital, clustering in the central Umayyad Square before Damascus's great eight-century mosque.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a purpose and a goal and now we are done with it. We want the state and security forces to be in charge," said Firdous Omar, who said he had been battling the Assad government since 2011 and was now looking forward to laying down his weapon and returning to his job as a farmer in provincial Idlib.
  <br>
  <br>
  The advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al Qaeda affiliate, was a generational turning point for the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ends a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble, swathes of countryside depopulated and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions. Millions of refugees could finally go home from camps across Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wipes out one of the main bastions from which Iran and Russia wielded power across the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey, long aligned with Assad's foes, emerges strengthened, while Israel hailed it as an outcome of its blows to Assad's Iran-backed allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab world faces the challenge of reintegrating one of the Middle East's central states, while containing the militant Sunni Islam that underpinned the anti-Assad revolt but has also metastasised into the horrific sectarian violence of Islamic State.
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations, but has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure foreign states and minority groups within Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's leader Golani, who spent years in US custody as an insurgent in Iraq but broke with al Qaeda and Islamic State to align his movement with more mainstream anti-Assad groups, has vowed to rebuild Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," he told a huge crowd at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Sunday. With hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's prime minister Jalali told Sky New Arabia he was ready to provide documents and assistance for the transfer of power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fate of Syria's army would be "left to the brothers who will take over the management of the country's affairs", Jalali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What concerns us today is the continuation of services for Syrians." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Air India has placed an order to buy 100 more Airbus aircraft, the Tata Group-owned carrier said on Monday, in a deal aimed at bolstering its fleet and winning over flyers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline said the deal consisted of 10 widebody A350 and 90 narrowbody A320 family aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new purchase, the company said in a statement, is "in addition" to the orders for 470 aircraft Air India placed with Airbus and Boeing last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the two deals were announced, it was the largest order unveiled at the same time by a commercial carrier, with list price calculations for the jets suggesting an estimated value north of US$70 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest order takes the total number of aircraft that Air India ordered with Airbus in 2023 from 250 aircraft, comprising 40 A350 and 210 A320 family aircraft, to 350," the carrier said in a statement, without giving price details on the latest order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking over the former national carrier in 2022, the sprawling Tata Group conglomerate has sought to turn around the loss-making airline by ordering new aircraft and upgrading its existing fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said the airline saw a "clear case" for Air India to expand its future fleet beyond the 470 aircraft ordered in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These additional 100 Airbus aircraft will help to position Air India on the path to greater growth and contribute to our mission of building Air India into a world-class airline that connects India to every corner of the world," Chandrasekaran said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement that he was pleased by Air India's latest investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having personally witnessed the formidable growth of the Indian aviation sector... I am glad to see Air India renew its trust in Airbus with this additional order," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this year, including 506,804 units sold in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90 percent of its total sales, stood at 17.1 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comparison, Volkswagen's two joint ventures with SAIC and FAW Group took a combined 11 percent market share in the January-November period, compared with 14.2 percent last year. (Reuters)

    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782725_1_20241209170136.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some taxi and transport trade representatives have reacted positively to the government's proposal to make the installation of surveillance cameras in cabs compulsory, saying it could help reduce quarrels between drivers and passengers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government told the legislature on Monday that in the next two years, it wants to mandate the installation of CCTV cameras in taxi cabins, as well as dashcams and Global Positioning System, along with the provision of at least two electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow Kwok-keung, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, described the cameras plan as long overdue.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the government should offer financial assistance, saying the trade is going through tough times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is like spring season arriving late. As for costs, you can find CCTV cameras in the market costing around HK$4,700, HK$5,000, or more than HK$7,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we're a bit disappointed that it seems the government won't be subsidising the camera installations at all. So we feel a bit unhappy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said e-payment is clearly the trend moving forward and the industry has to bear the responsibility to provide the systems needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, of the Liberal Party, also welcomed the proposals, noting that the use of CCTV cameras inside taxis is something he has called for for many years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said drivers actually want the cameras to protect themselves, as they're now subject to a points-deduction system that can lead to a licence suspension for malpractice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick said some drivers have encountered instances of passengers accusing them of engaging in wrongdoing, and cameras could help all sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also brushed aside any privacy concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've checked with the privacy commissioner, and I have got positive answers. Because inside the cab, it's not a private environment, it's semi-private, so you have to know that it's not a closed situation," the lawmaker told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think the most important thing is to make sure that the passenger is well-aware that the [CCTV] system is on."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for e-payments, Yick said he has come across instances where taxi owners have installed an e-payment system, but the drivers didn't want to use them and so kept them away from passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that making the systems mandatory would "help Hong Kong's reputation".

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Ex-lawmaker Chim Pui-chung, son convicted of fraud

<img alt="The District Court found former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son guilty of conspiracy to defraud. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782721_1_20241209160826.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son were on Monday found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court ruled that Chim, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his son Ricky Chim, who was the chairman, conspired with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case involved the issuance of convertible notes to increase the company's share capital while concealing a secret "shell company" agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma had agreed to pay the ex-lawmaker HK$210 million for 70 to 75 percent of Asia Resources' issued shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma's associate and businesswoman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A judge in 2022 issued an arrest warrant for the businessman who failed to report to the police and appear in court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his written judgement, Judge Ernest Lin cited evidence found by the ICAC in Chim's office in 2018, which revealed the former lawmaker as the mastermind behind the shareholding control scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial transactions were found to be unusually complex and "could not possibly be considered normal business activities", which were believed to hide the identities of those involved, the judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said the elder Chim also made use of his influence to arrange for his son to become the firm’s chairman and executive director and orchestrate transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge criticised the pair for treating the listed company as private property, harming both Asia Resources and its shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The victims were not only Asia Resources but also the company's small shareholders, who were denied both the option of a mandatory takeover offer and saw their personal investments turned into tools for others' profit-making," Lin wrote in the judgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While shell company acquisitions aren't illegal, their actions prevented the board from protecting shareholders' interests, Lin noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ICAC spokesperson said the graft-buster will continue to work closely with financial regulators to combat corruption and crimes involving listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ICAC will strive to uphold integrity and fair operation of the Hong Kong financial market and to foster the confidence of stakeholders in the financial system," the spokesperson said in a statement.

    Privacy breaches spark fraud alert for jobseekers

<img alt="The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data carried out investigations into JobsDB and eight organisations that placed 'blind ads', where the identity of those behind the post is not clear. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782705_2_20241209161751.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swindlers could be harvesting the personal information of jobseekers to commit fraud, a watchdog warned on Monday, after it found privacy breaches involving online job adverts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) said it carried out an investigation into JobsDB and eight organisations that used the platform to post "blind ads" – where the identity of those said to be recruiting isn't clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of the eight organisations that placed the aforesaid blind ads on JobsDB and requested job applicants to submit their personal data to unknown recruiting companies and JobsDB that published the same on its platform were involved in the unfair collection of the job applicants’ personal data, and this constituted contraventions of... the PDPO [Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance]," the watchdog said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it has therefore served enforcement notices on JobsDB and three of the organisations, ordering them to take measures to remedy the contraventions and prevent them from happening again. The other five organisations have been sent advisory notices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermina Ng, PCPD's senior legal counsel, said the eight organisations involved businesses in areas including financial securities, apparel retail, Chinese medicine and transport services. But she also warned that some online job adverts may not be legitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The privacy commissioner would also like to call upon other operators of online recruitment platforms to beware of anyone using blind ads to perpetrate fraud or collect personal data by unfair means and to carefully review recruitment advertisements to identify blind ads and avoid publishing the same in order to protect the personal data privacy of members of the public," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Blind ads may be used as an unscrupulous means to collect personal data and may be misused by swindlers to collect personal data for fraudulent activities. When jobseekers are unable to ascertain the employers’ identities, they should check and verify the information contained in the blind ads carefully and should not respond to the blind ads arbitrarily and submit their personal data."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng also urged employers to increase transparency when placing recruitment adverts, by disclosing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB said it has now required all companies to disclose their name and contact information in their advertisements "for the benefit of applicants".
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform also said the posting of blind ads was suspended in November, and when it resumes from Thursday, employers will not be able to directly access an applicant's personal information without revealing their identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The candidates' personal data that we collect – including their current role, industry, and the types of jobs they look for – is only used in connection with the services we provide, as disclosed in our privacy statement. We do not share personal data with third parties, other than as disclosed in our privacy statement or as permitted by law," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  JobsDB added it took steps to ensure job ads posted were genuine, including by manually verifying anyone placing recruitment adverts.

    SKorean justice ministry imposes travel ban on Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Monday imposed an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk-yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion and other charges in connection with his short-lived declaration of martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought special forces troops into Seoul streets, plunged South Korea into political turmoil and caused worry among its key diplomatic partners and neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most governing party lawmakers boycotting a parliamentary vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bae Sang-up, a Justice Ministry official, told a parliamentary hearing that it banned Yoon from leaving the country following requests by police, prosecutors and an anti-corruption agency as they expand their probes into the circumstances surrounding Yoon’s power grab.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a senior National Police Agency officer told local reporters in a background briefing that police can also detain Yoon if conditions are met.
  <br>
  <br>
  While a sitting South Korean president has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by police over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that police will forcefully detain him or search his office because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. (AP)

    Govt dept gets enforcement notice over Covid data leak

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Earlier this year a data leak was reported involving some 17,000 public housing tenants who underwent mandatory Covid tests in 2022. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782702_1_20241209135743.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government department failed to take adequate measures to protect the personal data of thousands of people ordered to undergo Covid tests back in 2022 and which was later found to be freely available online, the privacy commissioner's office said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In April this year the watchdog alerted officials to the fact that information including names, phone numbers, ID card numbers, addresses and Covid vaccination status of more than 17,000 public housing tenants was accessible online, without the need for any account or password.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blunder, by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), was made public a few days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an investigation by the watchdog, the department said that given it had stopped using the services of the e-form platform involved in the breach, it wrongly believed the personal data in question had been automatically deleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was only when EMSD became aware of the incident on 30 April 2024 that it requested the contractor to remove the personal data involved," said Hermina Ng, senior legal counsel for the privacy commissioner's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said the department had a lack of written policies on the retention of personal data, had failed to take the initiative to get the information deleted, and didn't follow up the issue with the e-form platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD merely assumed that the contractor would act on its own volition after the expiry of the contract. The EMSD had never urged, checked or reminded the contractor to delete the personal data from the e-form platform, and had never sought to understand or monitor the progress or effectiveness of the contractor’s relevant actions," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EMSD, as the data user, should not merely await passively for the contractor to take action, nor should it ride on its trust in the contractor and not to verify the work done by the contractor. This is another obvious deficiency."
  <br>
  <br>
  The privacy watchdog concluded that the EMSD failed to ensure the data collected was kept only for as long as necessary, and that it didn't safeguard the personal information from unauthorised or accidental access.
  <br>
  <br>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said an enforcement notice has been issued to the EMSD, directing it to take measures to remedy the violations and prevent similar situations from happening again in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the watchdog's findings, the department said it immediately conducted an in-depth enquiry with the contractor about the operational details of the server platform to ensure the complete removal of the relevant data.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD also said it introduced a number of measures, including developing a dedicated platform to store personal data on its own servers, to try to prevent a repeat of similar incidents in future.

    Govt to mandate cameras and e-payments for cabs

<img alt="The government plans to mandate the installation of taxi cameras and the provision of electronic payments in the next two years. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782694_1_20241209130644.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials on Monday said they plan to require taxi drivers to install surveillance cameras inside their vehicles by the end of 2026, and provide electronic payment methods by the end of next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  On top of that, drivers would also be required by law to install dashcams and Global Positioning Systems, to monitor their behaviour and collect data to help with investigations by law enforcement officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, transport officials said in the past year or so, lawmakers, taxi trade representatives and some members of the public had all said they want the installation of CCTV cameras in the vehicle cabins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This can record the situation inside the cabin. If disputes arise between taxi drivers and passengers, the footage can become evidence for the police or the Transport Department to follow up on the complaints, and investigate suspected malpractices such as overcharging and refusing a hire," the Transport and Logistics Bureau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said drivers would be allowed to pick their own devices, which would be properly sealed to guard against tampering, and data collected must be encrypted and only kept for 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The information would only be transferred to a planned Transport Department central platform when complaints arise or if there was an accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials stressed they attach great importance to privacy protection, and would contact the privacy commissioner to discuss guidelines on handling the data and offering training to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  On payment methods, the bureau said there are still plenty of drivers who only take cash, and this can easily cause disputes as passengers, especially tourists, find this very inconvenient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials proposed that drivers provide at least two types of electronic payment methods.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said while this might create extra costs for drivers, there are plenty of such platforms which offer promotions, such exempting device charges or handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it plans to table legal amendments for the proposals in the second quarter of next year.

 Australia on Monday launched an anti-semitism task force following an arson attack at a synagogue in Melbourne last week which police say was likely terrorism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire early on Friday at the Adass Israel synagogue injured one and caused widespread damage, and has strained relations between Australia and its ally Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the third anti-semitic attack in Australia this year, following the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office in Melbourne in June and anti-semitic graffiti daubed on cars in Sydney's eastern suburbs, an area with a high Jewish population, last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) task force will be known as Abalight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special Operation Abalight will be an agile and experienced squad of counter-terrorism investigators who will focus on threats, violence, and hatred towards the Australian Jewish community and parliamentarians," the head of the AFP Reece Kershaw told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In essence, they will be a flying squad to deploy nationally to incidents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the attacks on the Jewish community were concerning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Antisemitism is a major threat, and antisemitism has been on the rise," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Monday, Australian police transferred the investigation into Friday's blaze to a joint counter-terrorism unit, saying the blaze was likely a terrorist attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  State and federal police along with the country's domestic intelligence service will work in tandem to identify three suspects wanted in connection with the attack, Shane Patton, Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the best resources, best-skilled investigators, people who are expert in this field, and we will throw everything we can at this investigation to resolve it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police initially said on Friday it did not believe the fire met the threshold of a terror attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Designating it a suspected terror incident gives investigators additional resources and powers that include preventative detention, Patton said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have also stepped up patrols of Jewish areas in Melbourne in order to reassure the community there, he added. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China on Sunday defeated Romania 8-2 to take bronze at the International Table Tennis Federation Mixed Team World Cup in Chengdu, as Team China successfully defended their title.

  <br>
  <br>
  Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting, who were paired during the Paris Olympics in July, defeated Bernadette Szocs and Eduard Ionescu in back-to-back showings to put the SAR within one game of claiming the bronze medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong and Yiu rounded out the evening with an 11-4 win against Darius Movileanu and Ionescu to secure the prize.
  <br>
  <br>

    Soto to sign with New York Mets on record 15-year deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican baseball superstar Juan Soto has agreed to join the New York Mets on a record-breaking 15-year, US$765 million deal, multiple US media reports said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and Major League Baseball's official website both reported Soto's blockbuster move, which if confirmed would be the richest contract in the history of North American professional sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soto had entered free agency after playing last season for the New York Yankees, who had hoped to re-sign the gifted 26-year-old outfielder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal reported on Sunday eclipses the US$700 million, 10-year contract the Los Angeles Dodgers signed with Japanese star Shohei Ohtani last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that Soto's Mets contract could eventually be worth more than US$800 million if certain benchmarks were met.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guessing game over Soto's likely next destination had dominated baseball's rumor mill since the Yankees were beaten 4-1 by the Dodgers in the World Series in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees had mounted a concerted effort to re-sign Soto, who blasted 41 home runs and amassed 166 hits for the Bronx Bombers last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Yankees were just one of several teams actively pursuing the explosive slugger, with the Mets and the Boston Red Sox amongst the teams who met with Soto's representatives to discuss a possible deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets, however, won the race for Soto after a season in which they made a giant-killing playoff run to the National League Championship Series, where they eventually lost to the Dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets will be the fourth team of Soto's relatively short career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He exploded onto the Major League Baseball scene during his first full season in 2019, helping the Washington Nationals score an upset World Series victory over the Houston Astros.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejected a 15-year, US$440 million offer to stay with the Nationals in 2022, and was eventually traded to the San Diego Padres in August of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Soto failed to settle in San Diego and headed back to the east coast in December 2023 in a trade that took him to the Yankees. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs from a second Donald Trump White House while dealing with other headwinds, suggesting more policy stimulus could be needed to shore up growth. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Jokić erupts as Denver rout Hawks, Heat stun Cavs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nikola Jokić produced another dazzling high-scoring performance with a 48-point masterpice as the Denver Nuggets crushed the Atlanta Hawks 141-111 on the road on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokić – who scored a career-high 56 points in vain during a defeat to Washington on Saturday – was nearly unplayable in a dominant display that included 14 rebounds, eight assists and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Porter Jr. added 26 points for Denver while Christian Braun finished with 17 and Julian Strawther 13 in a wire-to-wire blowout against an Atlanta outfit who had gone into the contest on a six-game winning streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver coach Michael Malone was left purring with pleasure at Jokić's performance, describing the opportunity to coach the Serbian superstar as a privilege.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say I'm surprised because I've been spoiled by having the best seat in the house to watch this guy for 10 years, to watch him do it night-in, night-out," Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As much as we put on his shoulders, he never runs from it, never complains," he added. "I love his mental toughness and physical toughness. I feel privileged to have the chance to coach him – I never take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malone meanwhile was satisfied with a victory that lifts Denver to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a response that was needed," Malone said. "There's some stuff we can clean up, but we needed a win and we got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Sunday, Tyler Herro scored 34 points as the Miami Heat sent the Cleveland Cavaliers crashing to only their fourth defeat of the season with a 122-113 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro drained five three-pointers and was a perfect nine-from-nine from the free throw line to spearhead a third straight victory for in-form Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro was backed with 23 points from Duncan Robinson while Jimmy Butler added 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo also played a huge part in the victory with 16 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as Miami improved to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland meanwhile saw seven players finish in double figures, with Darius Garland leading the scoring with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disappointing loss for Cleveland was exacerbated by an injury to Evan Mobley who suffered a right ankle sprain that left him able to play only for 11min 46sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a bad one," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said of Mobley's injury, revealing the forward had initially sought to play through the knock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's a tough kid," Atkinson said. "It's unfortunate for us." (AFP)

    Streetathon organiser says instructions could improve

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of Hong Kong Streetathon has admitted that instructions could have been clearer after some half-marathon runners went miles out of their way in Sunday’s event.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the half-marathon and full marathon started near the East Coast Park in Causeway Bay and finished at San Shan Road in To Kwa Wan. But half-marathon runners did not have to go through the Tseung Lam Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of RunOurCity Foundation, said around 20 to 30 half-marathon runners accidentally entered the Tseung Kwan O–Lam Tin Tunnel when they should have turned right.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung told an RTHK programme on Monday that while the signs were set up correctly, staff could have taken more initiative to instruct runners where to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not saying the organiser can't improve. I think the staff could have been more proactive. They could have reminded runners, face-to-face, that full marathon runners should go straight ahead, while half-marathon runners should turn right. That would have been better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung added that staff training will be improved to prevent similar issues from happening again.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad is in Moscow with his family after Russia granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds, a Kremlin source told Russian news agencies on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Foreign Ministry said that Assad had left Syria and had given orders for a peaceful transfer of power, after rebel fighters raced into Damascus unopposed on Sunday, ending nearly six decades of his family's rule and a brutal 13-year civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian President Assad of Syria and members of his family have arrived in Moscow. Russia has granted them asylum on humanitarian grounds," state media quoted the unnamed Kremlin source as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Syrians awakened on Monday to a hopeful if uncertain future, after rebels seized the capital Damascus, forcing Assad to flee the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lightning advance of a militia alliance spearheaded by Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a former al-Qaeda affiliate, marked one of the biggest turning points for the Middle East in generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad's fall wiped out a bastion from which Iran and Russia exercised influence across the Arab world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the international community sought to take stock of a new-look Middle East following the end of Assad's autocratic rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said Syria is in a period of risk and uncertainty, and it is the first time in years that neither Russia, Iran nor Hezbollah held an influential role there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels face a monumental task of rebuilding and running a country after a war that left hundreds of thousands dead, cities pounded to dust and an economy hollowed by global sanctions. Syria will need billions of dollars in aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new history, my brothers, is being written in the entire region after this great victory," said Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the head of HTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to a huge crowd on Sunday at Damascus' Umayyad Mosque, a place of enormous religious significance, Golani said with hard work Syria would be "a beacon for the Islamic nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the US, Turkey and the United Nations, although it has spent years trying to soften its image to reassure international governments and minority groups within Syria. (Reuters)
