  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman described his walk-off grand slam as a dream come true on Friday after helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snatch a jaw-dropping World Series game one victory over the New York Yankees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman's 10th-inning blast - the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series game - was the latest improbable twist to what has been a roller-coaster season for the 35-year-old first baseman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, an avid student of the game, was delighted to learn he had etched his name into baseball history with his winning homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's pretty cool," Freeman said. "Obviously it's kind of amazing. When you get told you do something like that in this game that's been around a very long time -- I love the history of this game, to be a part of it, it's special.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been playing this game a long time, and to come up in those moments, you dream about those moments even when you're 35 and been in the league for 15 years, you want to be a part of those."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fact that Freeman has made it to the postseason is a minor miracle in itself after a challenging year beset by injuries, all overshadowed by a serious illness for his three-year-old son, Max.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An emotional Freeman returned to play later that month but then saw his postseason hopes clouded by a serious ankle sprain in late September that left him barely able to run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After celebrating his walk-off with team-mates, Freeman sprinted over to the seats behind home plate to share a moment with his father.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's been throwing me batting practice since I can remember," Freeman said. "My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him. I am who I am because of him. It was kind of spur of the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers manager Dave Roberts meanwhile believed that Freeman's moment of glory was just reward for one of the most popular players in baseball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The game honors you, and when you do things the right way, you play the right way, you're a good team-mate, I just believe that the game honors you," Roberts said. "Tonight Freddie was honored. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for transport Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the bureau will do all it can to cope with the series of test events to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first test event will take place on Sunday, featuring a youth football match with about 1,000 invited spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will be no parking or drop-off areas available at the Sports Park and people were urged to use MTR to enter the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his official blog, Lam noted that the bureau is aware of the broad public's concerns about transport arrangements for the sports park during large-scale events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government anticipated many spectators will use the Kai Tak Station and Sung Wong Toi Station to access the park, stressing that the MTR will strengthen services on the Tuen Ma line and Kwun Tong line based on actual needs and circumstances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said there are also plenty of nearby buses connecting all parts of Hong Kong near the park and bus operators will launch special bus routes to cope with special transportation needs during major events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that the transport bureau‘s emergency coordination centre will work closely with other governmental departments and public transport operators to monitor the situation and issue timely updates to the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, scheduled to take place from March 28 to 30 in 2025, is expected to be the first major event to be held at the Sports Park.

    Expansion of '1+' mechanism to lift healthcare quality

  <img alt="Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau says the expansion of the 1+ mechanism to cover all new drugs will elevate the region's healthcare standard. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776303_1_20241026112113.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Health emphasised that the expansion of the "1+" mechanism will not affect the quality of medicine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starting next month, the mechanism will cover all new drugs, including vaccines and advanced therapy products. Currently, it only includes new drugs for treating life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the relaxation only changes the mode of approval, not the requirements for approval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He believes the move will elevate the region's healthcare standard - the reason being that Hong Kong-registered drugs can be used in designated health institutions on the mainland, even if they have not been registered there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be able to, one, allow patients in Hong Kong and even in the Greater Bay Area to enjoy more advanced therapy products or new drugs...with the improvement of healthcare standard in the whole area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Two, with more choices, the cost of these new treatment drugs or advanced therapy products will be lowered. Thirdly, it will promote the development of R&D - research and development - in the area."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lo pointed out that the move will be attractive for pharmaceutical companies, as they can enjoy access to a bigger market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once the drug or device gets approved and registered in Hong Kong and is in-use at public hospitals, it will have a 'green channel' for use in the 86 million population of the GBA."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee voiced his support towards building a third medical school by local universities, in his third policy blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The health chief said it's "definitely good" to have one more medical institute, but warned that if the third medical institute is not up to scratch, it may affect the quality of the current two schools.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be cautious, because a medical school involves a lot of resources, not just capital, for medical training, such as professors...a teaching hospital, and even patients. Because teaching is not only held in classrooms, we need medical cases to do so."

    Crime up slightly in first nine months of 2024

  <img alt="Police Commissioner Raymond Siu says the force has been effective in tackling a new kind of fraud. Photo courtesy of Commercial Radio." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776295_2_20241026132940.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded 70,015 crimes in the first nine months of the year, marking a 4.8 percent increase from the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise mainly comes from a surge in fraud, theft and blackmail cases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former police chief Andy Tsang’s home in Tai Po was recently burglarised, with reports saying that over HK$100,000 worth of items were stolen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a Commercial Radio programme, Siu mentioned that burglary cases saw a 50 percent year-on-year increase in the first quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He noted the force had since enhanced prevention measures, leading to a decline in such crimes in the first nine months, when compared with last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have strengthened patrols, especially on village houses and detached homes. We have also done more intelligence gathering, and we're using technology as well. We use drones from the Government Flying Service to monitor remote areas to identify if there are suspicious persons,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Moreover, we have enhanced communication with residents, and urged them to report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious activities. All these measures have led to a noticeable improvement.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Siu noted there were 32,120 fraud cases in the first nine months of the year, 2,470 more compared with the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He highlighted that the surge primarily came from a new method of deception, where scammers pretend to be customer service representatives at e-commerce stores.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The police chief went on to say that the force had implemented targeted promotions and initiatives aimed at combating these types of fraud crime in the past few months, leading to a monthly decline in figures since July.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory has issued the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am on Saturday and said it will remain in force for most of the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster said Trami intensified into a typhoon this morning, skirting to the south of Hong Kong at a distance of about 500 kilometres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department said all child-care centres, facilities providing after-school care programmes, elderly services centres, rehabilitation units as well as day activity centres, will remain open during normal operating hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The organiser of the Hong Kong Food Carnival said the event has been postponed due to the typhoon, noting that the carnival will be cancelled for the rest of the day if Signal No. 3 remains in force after 1pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tourism Commission said the light-and-sound show, "A Symphony of Lights", will be cancelled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Habour Lounge at the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival is also closed under the strong wind signal number 3, but the doors of the festival remain open as usual.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory added that local winds are expected to strengthen with a few squally showers in Hong Kong, as the winds veer to the east later on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will consider issuing the Signal No.1 between tonight and Sunday morning, as winds ease off gradually.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776284_1_20241026101843.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel announced the launch of "precise strikes" on military targets in Iran on Saturday, in retaliation for attacks against it, as Iranian state media reported several explosions around the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel - right now the Israel Defense Forces (Israeli military) is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran," the military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel had vowed, following Iran's October 1 missile attack, to hit back.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostilities between Iran and Israel soared since Israel launched it's offensive in Gaza last October, which has so far killed over 42,000 Palestinians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has since broadened the scope of its operations to Lebanon, vowing to secure its northern border after nearly a year of cross-border attacks by Lebanese group Hezbollah.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilised," the Israeli military said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Military spokesman Daniel Hagari in a separate statement called on the people to be "alert and vigilant".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian state television said on Saturday "strong explosions" were heard around the capital, though it did not specify the cause of the blasts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Minutes ago, the sound of strong explosions were heard from around Tehran, the source of these sounds is not yet clear," a state TV presenter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iranian media said no fire or explosions had been reported at a main oil refinery near Tehran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said strikes by its ally Israel on military targets in Iran are "an exercise of self-defence" following the attack earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a possible indication of the scope of Saturday's strike, Syrian state news agency SANA said Syrian air defences had intercepted what it described as "hostile targets" near the capital city, Damascus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our anti-aircraft defence is confronting hostile targets in the skies around Damascus," SANA said on Telegram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also reported "sounds of explosions" in the vicinity of Damascus, though the origin of those blasts was unclear. (AFP)

   The Observatory says it will issue the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at 10.40am as Severe Tropical Storm Trami skirts the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Education Bureau said kindergartens and schools for children with physical and intellectual disabilities would be suspended for the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory said local winds are expected to pick up gradually in Hong Kong as the winds veer to the east later on, and some places which were previously sheltered become exposed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it expects the winds to ease off gradually on Sunday morning as Trami leaves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami was an estimated 560 kilometres south of Hong Kong, and is forecast to move across the South China Sea in the direction of the waters south of Hainan Island.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A man whose home had to be demolished because of coastal erosion lost a landmark legal claim on Friday against the UK government that accused it of failing to meet obligations to protect citizens from the effects of climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kevin Jordan, whose seaside home on the Norfolk coast in eastern England had to be knocked down, was one of two private claimants who brought the case, along with environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Co-claimant Doug Paulley, a disability activist, lives in a care home in northern England and says hotter summers affect his health and puts him at increased risk of serious harm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both claimed the government's climate adaptation aims policy, drawn up by the previous Conservative government, failed to comply with the country's 2008 Climate Change Act.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The claim also said the policy failed to assess impacts on protected groups under equality law and that it breached the human rights of the two individual claimants due to the lack of provision for the specific risks they faced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a judge at the High Court in London ruled on Friday that the government's plans were lawful – a decision described by Jordan as "extremely disappointing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friends of the Earth said its legal team will "study the detail of this judgement before we decide whether to lodge an appeal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A robust and comprehensive adaptation plan is urgently needed to help protect us from increasingly severe storms, floods and heatwaves – particularly marginalised groups, such as older and disabled people, and those living in areas most at risk from climate change," it added, urging the new Labour government to act. (AFP)

  <img alt="The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

   The nation's top legislative body will meet from November 4 to 8, Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Draft laws and amendments to be discussed at the meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee will cover mineral resources, energy, anti-money laundering measures, maritime issues and other areas, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawmakers would also review a draft preschool education law, and a draft revision to the Law on Protection of Cultural Relics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xinhua reported that the meeting will examine the State Council's financial work report, the management of state-owned assets and a special report on the administrative undertakings of state-owned assets last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The legislative top brass will also deliberate on matters related to appointments and removals of officials.

   Thousands descended upon Central Harbourfront on Friday to bask in the evening atmosphere and indulge in the finer things at the Wine and Dine Festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual flagship culinary event organised by the Tourism Board is featuring more than 300 booths from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil from South Africa was in a long queue outside a booth selling wines from the UK. He said the festival this year was bigger than even those before the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’ve been here previously, like pre-Covid. There’re a lot more people here. It seems a bit bigger. I’m having a really good time, so it’s interesting,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the nation’s alcohol producers have made leaps and bounds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I had a Chinese Chardonnay earlier, and it was good... I had some Chinese wines like 10 or 15 years ago, and it was terrible. Now, it’s like quite good.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At another booth was Umesh, who was enjoying a glass of Finnish wine. He said he was able to taste drinks that he had never tried before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’ve tried Finland’s. We’ve tried China’s. We’ve tried France’s. Not disappointed yet. I can’t wait to see the others, because I’ll probably find stuff that I don’t know existed,” he said of his first Wine and Dine Festival experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five-day festival will end on Sunday.

    Putin: It's our affair if Russia uses N Korean troops

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that it was Russia's business whether or not it decided to use North Korean troops, and that if Ukraine wanted to join Nato then Moscow could do what it wanted to ensure its own security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence that North Korea has sent 3,000 troops to Russia for possible deployment in Ukraine, a move that the West is casting as a significant escalation of the Ukraine war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ukraine's military intelligence service said that the first North Korean units trained in Russia had been deployed in the Kursk region, a Russian border area where Ukrainian forces took a chunk of Russian land in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we have to decide something, we will decide... but it is our sovereign decision whether we will apply it, whether we will not, whether we need it," Putin told Russian state television. "This is our business."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin said that the West repeatedly said that it was up to Ukraine how it ensured its security – "with or without Nato".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The sooner they realise the futility of such an approach in relations with Russia, the better it will be for everyone, and perhaps, above all, for themselves," Putin said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said Russia could send North Korean troops into battle as early as Sunday and urged international pressure on the Kremlin and Pyongyang.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "According to intelligence reports, on October 27-28, Russia will use the first North Korean military in combat zones," the Ukrainian leader said on social media, calling for "tangible pressure" to be placed on Russia and North Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement during Putin's visit to Pyongyang in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Article 4 of the agreement says: "If one of the parties is subjected to an armed attack by any state or several states and thus finds itself in a state of war, the other party will immediately provide military and other assistance with all means at its disposal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin on Thursday did not deny US claims that North Korea had sent troops to Russia but said it is up to Moscow how to run its mutual defence clause with Pyongyang and accused the West of escalating the Ukraine war. (Reuters/AFP)

   The SAR's swimming queen dominated the race – one of her favourite events – finishing with a time of 1:51.02, three seconds clear of silver medallist, Brittany Castelluzzo of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another Australian, Milla Jansen rounded up the podium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win comes hot on the heels of Haughey’s silver-medal performance in the women's 400-metres freestyle race on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old will feature in the 50-metre breaststroke and the 100-metre freestyle on Saturday, the last of her events for the Incheon leg of the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, 15-year-old SAR swimmer Li Su-yiu finished seventh in the race with a personal best of 1:59.17 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event is part of a qualifying series for the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest at the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Held over three consecutive weeks, the series began last week in Shanghai and concludes in Singapore early next month.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A streamlined regulatory regime aimed at speeding up the arrival in Hong Kong of medicines for serious diseases will be extended to cover all new drugs from November 1, the government said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the “1+” mechanism, a new drug can be registered in the SAR if just one reference regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than two in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism was introduced last November for new drugs to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, and five products have been approved under it so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Department of Health said extending the relaxed regime to all new medicines will bring more choice for patients and strengthen the city’s ability to evaluate drugs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex Lam, chairman of concern group Hong Kong's Patients’ Voices, said Hongkongers will benefit from lower prices and a larger variety of drugs on the market. But he cautioned that quality may be undermined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Previously we had two regulatory authorities’ approval, now we only need one. If that one authority comes from a country where the standing is not too high in the world, the quality may be lower and the risk to patients may be higher than before," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam said the World Health Organisation has stated which countries have higher standards regarding drug regulation, with most of them in Europe. In Asia, only Singapore and South Korea make it onto the list, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we expect more drugs coming from countries that are not listed as the highest standard, there may be a compensation of cost in terms of quality and risk associated with this kind of medicine. We have to be careful when we use it on patients in Hong Kong," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam added that the government needs to act as a gatekeeper to ensure patient safety, suggesting public hospitals should monitor the outcomes when patients are prescribed drugs approved under the mechanism, to check for any problems.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Vendors at this year’s Wine and Dine Festival said on Friday that they hope the weather doesn't dampen business over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A storm that prompted the observatory to issue a No 1 signal is expected to come within 500 kilometres of Hong Kong on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jeremy Li from a local gin brand said his business mainly welcomed locals in the first two days of the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told RTHK that the weather will play a part in how well they do over the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last year was the first year we joined the Wine and Dine [Festival], the weekend was really, really packed and busy,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Hopefully if the weather is nice, I guess [business] should be good [this weekend] too.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kit Leung, a merchant in the newly designated zone featuring British products, is also hoping for good weather.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[Our business] depends on the typhoon. We are looking at the sky,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The annual festival kicked off on Wednesday and will last for five days, instead of the usual four.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Customs officers on Friday said they seized smuggled goods with a market value of over HK$100 million during an operation last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They inspected a 40-foot container scheduled to set sail to Taichung, confiscating products including electronic appliances, routers, CPUs, computers and circuit boards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No arrests have been made so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shirley Woo, an investigator of Customs' syndicate crimes investigation bureau, said it's believed the intended final destination for the goods was the mainland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We believe that, given the huge demand for these smuggled products on the mainland, criminals are taking an indirect route to first smuggle the cargo to Taichung, and then use various means to smuggle it back to the mainland,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Woo added that more than HK$10 million in taxes would have been evaded if the smuggling had been successful.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Apple is welcome to deepen its presence in China in talks with the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook, for his part, pledged to increase investment in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At their meeting in Beijing on Friday, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Apple's business in China as well as China-US economic and trade relations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang said Beijing is willing to help return bilateral economic and trade ties to a healthy and stable track through regular exchanges between government officials and firms, and provide quality services for foreign enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China will further optimise its business environment and continue to provide high-quality services for foreign-funded firms," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang added that Apple is welcome to maintain stable cooperation with Chinese partners to achieve common development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook said China's rapid development helps Apple achieve fast and sustainable growth, and the company will continue to serve as a bridge between Beijing and Washington in economic and trade issues. (Xinhua and agencies)

   The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said the Standby Signal No. 1 will stay up until at least 6 am on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Severe Tropical Storm Trami is expected to skirt about 500 kilometres to the south of Hong Kong on Saturday morning, it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The forecaster predicted strong winds in some areas, especially offshore and on high ground due to the combined effects of Trami and a northeast monsoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But It said local winds will not strengthen much because the prevailing winds will mainly be northerlies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Depending on the distance of strong winds associated with Trami from the Pearl River Estuary and the change in local wind conditions, the observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 during the day [on Saturday]," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local winds are expected to weaken on Sunday when Trami moves further away, the observatory added.

    Trami leaves towns submerged, 66 dead in Philippines

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Philippine rescue workers battled floodwaters on Friday to reach residents still trapped on the roofs of their homes as Tropical Storm Trami moved out to sea after killing at least 66 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tens of thousands remained displaced after fleeing floods driven by a torrential downpour that dumped two months' worth of rainfall in just two days in some areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Many are still trapped on the roofs of their homes and asking for help," Andre Dizon, police director for the hard-hit Bicol region, said. "We are hoping that the floods will subside today, since the rain has stopped."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Accessibility remained a major issue for rescuers on Friday, particularly in Bicol, President Ferdinand Marcos said at a press briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There were landslides in areas that didn't have landslides before... so I guess the soil is completely saturated, the water has nowhere to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The cities of Naga and Legazpi were reporting "many casualties but we haven't been able to get in yet," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Trami departed the Philippines in the early hours, the storm's death toll swelled as fresh reports of victims emerged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas province south of the capital Manila, police staff sergeant Nelson Cabuso said six unidentified bodies had been found in Sampaloc village.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The area was hit by a flash flood yesterday. Our people are still in the area to check if there are other casualties," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in the province stood at at least 34.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Manila was seemingly spared the kind of heavy flooding that accompanied Typhoon Gaemi in July, a subdivision south of the capital was seen to be largely submerged. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hit out at "biased" media reports related to a party scandal, as a fresh survey suggested that his ruling coalition could fall short of a majority in elections on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This would be the worst result for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) – which has governed Japan for almost all of the past seven decades – since it last lost power from 2009 to 2012, as well as a major blow to Ishiba himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Adding to Ishiba's woes is the continuing fallout from a slush fund scandal within the LDP that angered voters and helped torpedo his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba promised to not actively support LDP politicians caught up in the scandal running in the election, although they are still standing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to media reports, the party has still provided US$132,000 each to district offices headed by these figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is truly frustrating that such reports come out at a time like this," Ishiba said in a campaign speech on Thursday. "Those candidates will not use the money."

   <br/>
   "We cannot be defeated by those with biased views," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Opposition leaders pounced on Ishiba's comments, including Yoshihiko Noda, a popular former prime minister who heads the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the second-biggest in parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "However you look at it, it is cash to secretly endorse them. Mr Ishiba is making excuses that no one understands," Noda, 67, said in a campaign speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He is angry with these reports? What are you saying? It is the Japanese people who are angry." (AFP)

    Govt hopes probe will help prevent abuse at care homes

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The secretary for labour and welfare said on Friday that he hopes an investigation by an operator of a care home into alleged abuse there could help prevent cases in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A care home worker of Hong Chi Association was arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting two residents while on duty. The association has terminated the employee and promised its own probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope Hong Chi Association's independent review committee can complete its work as soon as possible, look into details if any improvements can be made systematically, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents won't happen again in the future," Chris Sun said on an RTHK radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the government is not in a position to offer details of abuse cases reported from four other care facilities, citing privacy concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun added that the Social Welfare Department has issued warnings to 15 care homes in the past year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A warning letter is intended to inform care homes of any shortcomings, or if it's suspected of breaking the rules. We have to warn them. But the public has to understand that the warnings cannot include all the details.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So we've always adopted a similar practice in issuing warning letters. The main point of doing so is to notify care homes of inappropriate actions and shortcomings. This can also allow the industry to know that they have to focus on a certain area and step up their efforts in this regard."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Social Welfare Department will review the licence of the care home operated by Hong Chi Association annually in the wake of the case, instead of the current practice of every three years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun said the department's next move depends on the findings of the independent review committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The operation of a care home depends on its quality and whether its operations are up to the required standard. That's one thing. But if someone does bad things for an ulterior motive, that's mostly down to the individual. The two things have to be separated," he said.

    Dinosaur fans excited to see HK fossils

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   People gathered bright and early on Friday morning to catch a glimpse of the first-ever dinosaur fossils found on home soil, as they went on display at the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced earlier this week that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period had been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chong Got was the first to arrive for the opening of the display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know about it actually, that’s why I’m coming here to learn from it. It’s amazing to see the fossils. When I was young, going to the museum, to the souvenir shop, and looking at this small, tiny piece of stone, and then you could find the fossil of a silhouette of, like, a beetle or a shell. It’s already amazing enough,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Here we are talking about dinosaurs. I don’t know how many millions of years now. So it really would be an amazing opportunity for me, to open my eyes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also at the exhibition was Rick Dong who said he has seen dinosaur fossils in other museums, but was excited to see the first found in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good opportunity for the local citizens to come here to see this fossil. And with the development, I think we’ll have more fossils to develop and be shown here for the citizens to see,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[It’s a] very good operation, because for science, there’s no boundary. We should work together with the scientists from all over the world to develop and do research.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gavin Kwai had taken his six-year-old son Joshua to the exhibition, saying it was an educational opportunity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a very good chance for them to learn… When we went to, like, the Science Park’s exhibition beforehand about dinosaurs, sometimes they asked us if we are going to see dinosaurs in Hong Kong or if we are going to discover some. Or they will ask us if it was discovered in Hong Kong and where it was in Hong Kong,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But like beforehand, we usually disappointed them by saying, ‘It’s from other countries, you are not likely to find something like this in Hong Kong.’ It’s very amazing this time that we can really truly discover something in Hong Kong.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   History lover Nitin Gupta said he didn't know much about dinosaurs, but was glad there were staff available to explain the fossils to him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ringo Ng, assistant curator of archaeological preservation at the centre, said staff will be arranged to provide explanations from time to time, but they hope to have guides stationed there in the future.

   Financial Secretary Paul Chan has concluded his three-day visit to New York and is expected to be back in Hong Kong on Friday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the final day of his stay, Chan met representatives from several family offices at a breakfast meeting, introducing them to Hong Kong's advantages as a global hub for asset and wealth management, as well as the latest developments in this field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before leaving New York, Chan toured a local startup accelerator platform, Newlab, and told them about Hong Kong’s plan to establish more accelerator bases to support the growth of startups. The finance minister also invited the platform to consider setting up a base in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in his trip, Chan met local political and business figures, think tanks, as well as financial and banking professionals to address their questions and brief them about Hong Kong’s latest situation and opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also held discussions about China-US economic and trade relations with Acting Consul General of China in New York Ma Xiaoxiao.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four time NBA champion Klay Thompson scored 22 points in his Dallas debut on Thursday, giving a lift to Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic in a 120-109 NBA victory over the San Antonio Spurs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slovenian star Doncic scored 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Mavs, who fell to the Boston Celtics in last season's NBA Finals and acquired Thompson in a free agent deal in the off-season with the hope of going even further this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thompson, who won four titles in 13 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, was delighted with his first outing for the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Blue is my favorite colour," he told broadcaster TNT. "And Mavs blue looks good on me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 15 points for Dallas, and the Mavericks harried the Spurs defensively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama, aiming to build on last season's Rookie of the Year campaign, connected on just five of 18 shots from the field on the way to 17 points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spurs coughed up 19 turnovers leading to 17 Mavericks points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chris Paul, an 11-time All-Star point guard brought in to lend veteran experience to the young San Antonio squad trying to get the Spurs back in the playoffs after a five-season absence, scored all of his points on a lone three-pointer, finishing one-of-six from the field with eight assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Couldn't ask for a better start," Thompson said. "Just sharing the flow with Kyrie, Luka and the rest of the guys – very special after a hard month of really good work."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But it's just a small step for where we want to go," he added.  (AFP)

    Félix double fires Chelsea in Conference League rout

  <div class="itemFullText">
   João Félix ended his goal drought with a brace as Chelsea powered to a 4-1 win against Panathinaikos in the Uefa Conference League, while Welsh club The New Saints made history with a 2-0 victory against Kazakh side Astana on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Portugal forward Félix has struggled to make an impact since returning for a second spell with Chelsea in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yet to start a Premier League game following his move from Atlético Madrid, the 24-year-old seized the chance to prove a point to Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Félix's only goal in seven previous appearances this season came on his debut at Wolves on August 25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He ended his six-game barren run in the first half against out-classed Panathinaikos and netted again after the interval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mykhailo Mudryk and Christopher Nkunku were also on target as Chelsea made it two wins from two games in the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is no matter how many players we change, you can see the identity of the team. The identity is quite clear," Maresca said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we want is exactly what they're doing, taking the chance when we give it to them," he added. "Tonight once again they showed that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Maresca made 11 changes from the side that lost at Liverpool last weekend, but still fielded a strong side that was far too dynamic for the Greeks. (AFP)

    Mourinho sees red as Fenerbahce hold Man Utd

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Fenerbahce boss José Mourinho said his former club Manchester United escaped Istanbul with a point after he was sent to the stands in a 1-1 Uefa Europa League draw on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United have drawn all three of their European games this season and a point does little to ease the pressure on under-fire manager Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christian Eriksen fired a depleted United in front on 15 minutes, but Fenerbahce had the better of the chances and got their reward when Youssef En-Nesyri equalised early in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We were better than them, so overall a good result for Manchester United," Mourinho said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A point leaves United languishing in 21st of the 36-team table and with their chances of securing a top-eight finish to progress directly to the last 16 fading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fenerbahce are in 14th on five points, with a top-24 finish enough to qualify for the playoff stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mourinho also came into the game under pressure early in his reign with Fenerbahce trailing rivals Galatasaray by eight points at the top of the Turkish Super Lig.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we play like this in the Turkish league, we destroy every team," added Mourinho, who was shown a red card for his protests after appeals for a penalty were waived away in the second half. "He (the referee) told me something incredible. He could see the action in the box, and my behaviour on the touchline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I congratulate him because it is incredible his peripheral vision. During the game, 100 miles per hour, he had one eye on the penalty situation and one eye on the bench and my behaviour," Mourinho said. "That is why he is one of the best referees in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United were without 10 players, including captain Bruno Fernandes, due to suspension or injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Fernandes' absence, defender Noussair Mazraoui started in an unfamiliar attacking midfield role and had a part to play in an impressive opening goal. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained on Thursday, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields from a three-month high, which buoyed market sentiment despite declines from some corporate results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Tesla soared, with the EV-maker set to add more than US$140 billion to its market capitalization, after it reported robust third-quarter profits and surprised investors with a prediction of 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This helped take the Consumer Discretionary sector higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a blowout from the perspective of Tesla," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark S&P posted its first daily gain this week. However, sentiment was somewhat shaky. Most of the S&P sectors were in the red, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still high Treasury yields weighed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.20 percent, after reaching a three-month high the day before. It went as high as 4.26 percent in Wednesday's session, which saw all three major equity indexes lose ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the near term, the greatest influence we've seen in stocks in October has been the move higher in rates. From a 10-year Treasury below 4 percent to where we stand now has been relatively quickly," said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earnings announced before the bell include IBM, which lost after missing third-quarter revenue estimates, while Honeywell declined after it forecast annual sales below estimates, with both weighing on the blue-chip Dow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow fell a third of a percent to 42,374. The S&P gained a fifth of a percent to end at 5,809, while the Nasdaq gained 0.76 percent to 18,415.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Materials dropped, dragged down by Newmont as higher costs and weaker Nevada output saw it miss profit estimates. Boeing also lost after factory workers voted on Wednesday to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week-long strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weekly jobless claims also fell unexpectedly for the week ended Oct. 19. (Reuters)

    Abandon 'mad pursuit' of money, says Pope

  <img alt="Pope Francis delivered the message in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776073_1_20241024211531.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis urged the world's 1.4 billion Catholics to abandon the "mad pursuit" of money and instead devote themselves to their faith in a new encyclical letter, the highest form of papal teaching, released on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis' fourth encyclical over his 11-year papacy largely abstains from talking about political issues, a departure from his earlier writings, which also addressed themes such as global climate change and "trickle-down" economic policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Dilexit nos" (He loved us) instead encourages believers to strengthen their religious lives. The world is living in an "age of superficiality," the pope says, and Catholics and other Christians "need to rediscover the importance of the heart".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In a world where everything is bought and sold, people's sense of their worth appears increasingly to depend on what they can accumulate with the power of money," Francis writes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The love of Christ has no place in this perverse mechanism, yet only that love can set us free from a mad pursuit that no longer has room for a gratuitous love," says the pontiff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 142-page text focuses on spiritual themes, rather than calls for concrete political action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pope's 2015 letter "Laudato Si'" (Praise Be) urged the world to care for the environment and has been credited by some world leaders with influencing discussions ahead of the 2016 Paris Agreement. His 2020 letter "Fratelli Tutti" (Brothers All) called for a reconsideration of economic policies in the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new letter instead offers reflections on a Catholic spiritual practice promoted by a 17th century French nun. Sr. Margaret Mary Alacoque, who reportedly experienced several visions of Jesus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christians should emulate Jesus' love by also caring for those in need, the pope says. "There is no greater way for us to return love for love," he states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Release of the papal document comes as Francis is leading a month-long summit of global Catholic leaders at the Vatican, which is expected to release its own text on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Discussions around most of the divisive issues originally part of the summit's considerations, such as the possibility of letting women be ordained as Catholic clergy, have now been put on hold. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 early on Friday, and said the signal will remain in force until at least 6pm as Severe Tropical Storm Trami moves across the central and northern parts of the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is forecast to stay more than 600 kilometres from Hong Kong for most of the daytime hours, and its strong winds have not yet had an effect on the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned that the combined effect of Trami and the northeast monsoon would bring occasionally strong winds offshore and on high ground, but it also said local winds won't strengthen significantly during the day due to terrain sheltering effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The need to issue Strong Wind Signal No. 3 thereafter will depend on the distance between Trami and Hong Kong and the change in local wind strength," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory added that Trami will move towards the vicinity of Hainan Island and local winds will weaken later on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said it would closely monitor Trami and assess the need to keep the signal in effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Observatory warned people living in low-lying areas or places exposed to the high winds should take precautions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It advised the public not to engage in water sports and fishing vessels in the open sea should seek shelter.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   At least 1.1 million people on India's eastern coast hunkered down in storm shelters ahead of a powerful cyclone set to hammer the low-lying region early Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cyclone Dana is likely to hit the coasts of West Bengal and Odisha states -- home to around 150 million people -- as a "severe cyclonic storm", India's weather bureau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It predicts winds gusting up to 120 kilometres per hour to cause "major damage" to thatch-roofed houses, which are common on the coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Downpours began lashing areas of neighbouring West Bengal state, prompting officials there to be on high alert, while Odisha already saw strong winds and rain on Thursday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have closed schools, cancelled more than 200 trains, suspended flights and warned fishermen not to venture out to sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India's navy said two ships were "standing by with supplies and rescue and diving teams".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eye of the storm is predicted to make landfall early Friday, near the coal-exporting port of Dhamra.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Government disaster response teams drove the streets, broadcasting warnings from loudspeakers urging people to take shelter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crashing waves are expected to inundate swathes of coastal areas, with water predicted to surge up to two metres above usual tide levels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India’s eastern coasts have long been prone to cyclones, but the number of intense storms is increasing along the country’s coast, with global warming driven by planet-heating gases causing them to become more extreme and unpredictable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year was India’s deadliest cyclone season in recent years, killing 523 people and costing an estimated US$2.5 billion in damage. (AP/AFP)

    Jailed British nurse Lucy Letby loses appeal

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former British nurse and convicted child serial killer Lucy Letby on Thursday lost an attempt to appeal against her conviction for trying to murder a newborn baby, amid questions over the fairness of her trials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby, 34, was found guilty of murdering seven children and attempting to murder seven more between June 2015 and June 2016 while working in the neonatal unit of the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester, northern England, making her Britain's worst serial child killer of modern times.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was convicted of an eighth count of attempted murder at a retrial earlier this year, after the original jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge that Letby tried to kill a baby girl by removing her breathing tube.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prosecutor Nick Johnson told Manchester Crown Court that, little more than an hour after the child was born, a senior doctor found the baby's breathing tube dislodged and Letby standing there "doing nothing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's lawyer Benjamin Myers told London's Court of Appeal on Thursday that Letby "maintains and has maintained she is not guilty of the offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He argued that the retrial was an abuse of process as Letby could not have a fair trial because of extensive coverage of her convictions, which featured "intense hostility towards her" and comments made by the Crown Prosecution Service and police.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There was no way in which the jury in trial two were going to have the publicity and the comment and the hostility ameliorated," Myers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge William Davis refused Letby's application for leave to appeal against the conviction from her retrial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby attended the hearing by videolink from prison and sat impassively as the judge stated the court's reasons for refusing her application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The outcome of the first trial undoubtedly led to an unusually large amount of publicity and online debate," Davis said. "That is because, on its face, the case was extraordinary."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Letby's attempt to overturn her convictions from the first trial was refused in May. She can now only challenge those convictions if the Criminal Cases Review Commission refer those cases back to the Court of Appeal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since her trials, Letby's conviction has come under a spotlight, following criticism by some experts of medical and statistical evidence presented by the prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some media have questioned whether she might be the victim of a miscarriage of justice, while a public inquiry into her crimes continues.  (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday strongly condemned overseas individuals exerting improper pressure on a senior judge, labelling it as blatant interference of ongoing criminal proceedings in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There have been media reports that Court of Final Appeal non-permanent judge Patrick Keane was met by protests when he spoke at an event in Sydney, with demonstrators calling for the release of former media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 66-year-old joined the bench of Hong Kong's top court in 2023, following his retirement from the High Court of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Any attempt by any organisation or individual to exert pressure on judges and judicial officers, and interfere with the criminal justice process by means of political power or any other means, is clearly a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the SAR and should be vehemently condemned," a government spokesman said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spokesman pointed out legal proceedings regarding Jimmy Lai's case are still ongoing, and it was inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case, or exert improper interference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All defendants will receive a fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights," the statement added.

   Three pedestrians were hospitalised after the glass wall of a Tsuen Wan shopping mall shattered on Thursday, sending pieces of glass onto the pavement below.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police said that at about 6.30pm, a five-by-three-metre section of the curtain wall cracked and fell from the fifth floor of Citywalk One.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Images from the scene show shards of glass littered across a cordoned-off section of the pavement on Wo Tik Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pedestrians were hurt in the forehead and shoulders, and have been sent to Yan Chai Hospital for treatment.

   <br/>
   The weather agency said combined with an approaching northeast monsoon, it will be windy and cloudy with a few showers over the on Friday and the weekend.

   Hong Kong's swimming queen Siobhan Haughey won a silver medal on Tuesday at the second stop of the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Incheon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She completed the women's 400 metres freestyle race in three minutes, 58.06 seconds, 1.28 seconds behind gold medalist, Mary-Sophie Harvey of Canada.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan's Waka Kobori rounded up the podium, while 19-year-old SAR swimmer Ng Lai-wa finished eighth with a personal best of four minutes, 18.03 seconds.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Thursday said he is highly concerned about an abuse case at a care home and that the government will take serious follow-up actions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Chi Association, which operates the facility, said in a statement on Wednesday that the case was discovered in August, and they immediately reported it to police and the Social Welfare Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department confirmed the case on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun told reporters on Thursday that officials wanted to ensure that the alleged victims and their families were in a stable emotional state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We want to prevent them from experiencing further harm. Therefore we felt it was important to wait until their situation was stable before making the announcement,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This is a matter of balance that we hope to achieve.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case involved a 38-year-old male staff member of the care home, who has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two residents while on duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association said they terminated the employee, and will set up an independent review committee to evaluate protective measures for service users.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tropical Storm Trami has killed at least 26 people and forced more than 150,000 to flee their homes in the Philippines, officials said on Thursday, as it made landfall on the northeastern coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, locally known as severe tropical storm Kristine, dumped heavy to torrential rain on the main island of Luzon, triggering widespread flooding and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With maximum sustained winds of 95 kph (59 mph), the storm was moving westward across the mountainous northern region of Cordillera towards the South China Sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forecasters warned of heavy to intense rainfall, flooding, landslides and storm surges for some northern provinces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the deaths from the storm over the past few days were due to drowning and landslides in the central Bicol region, including Naga city where 14 were reported dead on Thursday, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami made landfall in the northeastern town of Divilacan in Isabela province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government ordered businesses and schools in the path of the storm to close in anticipation of heavy rain and floods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 163,000 people were sheltering in evacuation centres, the civil defence office said, most of whom were in Bicol as residents fled their homes after floodwaters reached as high as the roofs of bungalow houses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a powerful cyclone is expected to barrel into India's eastern coast early on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dana is expected to cross the coasts of the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal between midnight Thursday and Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The states expect to evacuate around 300,000 people each, and Odisha has already moved 50,000 people to relief shelters. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea "won't sit idle" over the North's deployment of thousands of troops to help Russia fight Ukraine, President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Thursday, slamming it as a "provocation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency has claimed that about 3,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia training, likely to deploy to the frontlines against Ukraine soon, with thousands more troops to be sent by December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato and Washington have confirmed that Pyongyang's soldiers are now training in Russia, warning that if they were to join the fight against Kyiv, it could mark a dangerous escalation of the grinding war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "South Korea won't sit idle over this," Yoon said after talks with visiting Polish President Andrzej Duda, adding that the two countries agreed North Korea's deployment was "a provocation that threatens global security beyond the Korean Peninsula and Europe".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Poland's Duda spoke to Yoon on Thursday, after which the two leaders "strongly condemned North Korea's nuclear and missile development and provocations“.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   North Korea has previously denied deploying forces to Russia, while Moscow has not confirmed it, but has defended its military cooperation with Pyongyang. (AFP)

   The observatory says it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between 10pm on Thursday and 4am on Friday as Tropical Cyclone Trami edges closer to the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said Trami is expected to gradually move towards the vicinity of Hainan and come within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong on Thursday night or Friday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said a higher typhoon signal could be possible on Friday or Saturday, depending on the storm's movement and any change in local wind conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The observatory said Trami could linger in the vicinity of Hainan or move eastwards across central and northern parts of the South China Sea early next week.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two separate government departments that deal with unauthorised land use should start working more closely with each other and share intelligence to put a stop to offenders, the Ombudsman said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jack Chan said he has come up with 16 recommendations for the planning and lands departments on how they can better tackle the hundreds of complaints they get each year about problems such as people filling in ponds without permission or turning green belt land and conservation zones into car parks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said the Planning Department's enforcement action sometimes fails to deter repeat offenders and such people should be given less and less time to comply with enforcement notices for each subsequent breach they make.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lands Department, meanwhile, needs to improve guidelines and training for staff so they can better deal with priority cases in a timely manner, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ombudsman said getting different parts of the government to collaborate more is one of his major goals and to this end, the planning and lands departments "should work together in such cases and to sort it out, instead of one department handling its own matters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also recommended the two departments establish a database for unauthorised development cases "to facilitate interdepartmental intelligence sharing and enforcement, as well as formulate targeted measures for high-risk sites to nip problems in the bud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, the two departments vowed to strengthen cooperation with each other, such as by conducting joint enforcement operations against large-scale unauthorised cases through a pilot scheme, and setting up a high-level communication platform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Planning Department also said it would continue to tackle illegal developments to meet public expectations and streamline its enforcement workflow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the Lands Department, it said it would review existing guidelines and enhance staff training to follow up on cases in a timely manner.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing workers in the Seattle region decisively rejected the US aerospace giant's latest contract offer on Wednesday, extending their nearly six-week strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Almost two-thirds – 64 percent – of the members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 rejected the contract, the union said on social media platform X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest Boeing offer had included a 35 percent wage hike, but did not reinstate a pension plan sought by many employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 33,000 hourly workers with the IAM have been on the picket line since September 13, when workers overwhelmingly rejected a Boeing proposal for a new four-year contract to replace the expiring pact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strike has halted activity at two Seattle-area factories that assemble the 737 MAX and 777.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers had sought a 40 percent wage increase to make up for years of tepid salary growth that have not kept pace with inflation and that employees complain leave them unable to afford living in one of the most costly regions of the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 years of sacrifices, we still have ground to make up, and we're hopeful to do so by resuming negotiations promptly," Jon Holden, president of the Seattle union, said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is workplace democracy – and also clear evidence that there are consequences when a company mistreats its workers year after year," Holden said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ten years of holding workers back unfortunately cannot be undone quickly or easily, but we will continue to negotiate in good faith until we have made gains that workers feel adequately make up for what the company took from them in the past," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said Wednesday night the company had no comment on the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extension of the strike adds to the troubles facing Boeing and its new CEO Kelly Ortberg, who earlier Wednesday expressed measured optimism the latest contract would be ratified. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The development minister on Thursday said that her bureau will consider merging the City Gallery in Central with a new exhibition hall in Wan Chai, which will showcase major development projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Development Bureau said the HK$600 million exhibition will feature projects such as the Northern Metropolis as well as the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Bernadette Linn acknowledged that some people have expressed concerns over the amount of money involved in the project, but stressed that the construction fee is similar to that of other government buildings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She also revealed that the government will take into consideration lawmakers’ suggestion to merge the City Gallery with the new exhibition hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The City Gallery showcases Hong Kong's planning history. It also exhibits part of the Northern Metropolis project because we don't have anywhere else to showcase the project," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lawmakers have suggested the existing exhibits in the City Gallery could be merged together with our proposed facility in a larger gallery hall, so that the City Gallery can be vacated. We think it's a good suggestion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Linn added they hope the new facility in Wan Chai will open in 2027.

    'Use MPF records to counter fake qualifications'

  <img alt="The ICAC has arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775982_1_20241024113341.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group for construction site safety on Thursday said authorities could consider using Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) records as a more reliable way to verify workers’ employment histories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suggestion came after the anti-graft agency ICAC said it arrested 148 people for allegedly using fake qualifications to obtain excavator operator and electrician licences, which involved applicants attending phony courses, and receiving documents claiming they attained the required work experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chair of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner’s Education and Training Committee, Lee Kwong-sing, said people are seeking shortcuts to obtain licences to improve their job prospects because the construction industry is doing well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The expert also pointed out that there is a loophole in the current way work experience is verified, in which only an employer’s letter is required.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If authorities required MPF contribution records, it would be much harder to fake qualifications. Applicants would need three to five years of records to qualify, which requires long-term planning," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But that's not the case now. At the moment they can just verify using an employer's letter, which seems a bit casual."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Labour Department said 100 excavator operator and 32 electrician licences have been revoked so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Simon Tang, co-founder of home decoration consultancy Deco Academy, told RTHK that unlicensed electrical work might lead to improper installations and high repair costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For the installation part, if the lines are just installed in the concrete directly without passing through the plastic pipe, when there is water leakage, for example, then it may cause high repair costs and it may cause danger for the residents," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang said an electrician's licence is often needed for those carrying out home renovation work, but the authorities don't always scrutinise these licences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The checking is a very selective process. So they do not check every case. And also, they do not scrutinise all details. Basically, they do not scrutinise every submission. And there's no penalty if the submission is not successful," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland tourists joining new tours of Hong Kong shopping malls won't be obliged to go on a spending spree, a retail industry representative said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Travel Industry Council and Retail Management Association have devised 14 different itineraries for "in-depth tours" of five shopping centres in the city, with participants promised the chance to hear some  "urban legends" during their two-hour visits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Association chairwoman Annie Yau Tse said that while participants will be received by a mall representative and will be offered discounts on their spending, they will be free to roam around and can decide for themselves where to make any purchases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With concerns that tourists are spending less in Hong Kong, Tse said it will be down to the shops in the malls to try to get visitors to splash the cash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is that there are customers around. Once they come into the malls, we can think of ways to attract them to consume," she said on an RTHK programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there are no customers at all, then really nothing can be done. So when there are more people around, that's already an advantage for us."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first-ever discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong is a "momentous" achievement and could mark the beginning of a series of exciting finds in the wider region, a palaeontologist said on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials announced on Wednesday that dinosaur fossils believed to date back to the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago, have been discovered on Port Island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery of these bones is super exciting because we have rocks of the right age and the right environment but having looked for so many years, different people have not been able to find dinosaur bones, including myself," said Michael Pittman from the School of Life Sciences at Chinese University.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From what I hear they seem to be from some larger dinosaurs. I've seen pictures of models that are of long-neck dinosaurs and the hadrosaur dinosaurs, so these are among the biggest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman said the find was also "very lucky" since Hong Kong isn't an ideal location for fossil preservation, given that the territory had a lot of volcanic activity in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that finding dinosaur bones in the SAR is challenging due to the topography and landscape.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There have been Jurassic-age fish, there have been older Devonian fish. Very interesting, but not like large volumes of fossils, and that's partly because there's not much area to look for fossils. Also, the rocks are quite hard and they don't readily erode out fossils," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When we look for fossils, we typically go to a place where you can easily access them, and we focus on places where there are lots and lots of fossils, so it's rich in fossils and makes it easier. So because of those various reasons I mentioned, Hong Kong hasn't been a focus point for looking for fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said China is one of four main countries in the world for dinosaur fossils, along with the US, Canada and Argentina, but the Guangdong area is famous only for dinosaur eggs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pittman also welcomed the signing of an agreement between the Development Bureau and the mainland's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, to deepen exchanges and cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously, finding some fossils in Hong Kong enriches our local palaeontology heritage. But my hope is the agreement would help to further exchanges with the institute, which people like myself have been working for for more than a decade," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dinosaur fossils will be on public display at the Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park from Friday.

    'Civil servants welcome new family-friendly measures'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Thursday revealed that civil servants and unions have welcomed its move to offer more family-friendly measures, with officials expressing the hope that the rest of society would follow suit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes after Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his Policy Address last week that civil servants with children under three can get three days of childcare leave annually starting next April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, the Secretary for the Civil Service Ingrid Yeung was asked if the government is taking the lead by rolling out more family-friendly measures, to which she responded: “We hope the whole society can offer more childcare measures to help parents.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added that the reaction to the new measure has been "really good". "The unions and other civil servant colleagues have welcomed the measure and are looking forward to it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after the show, she said the government will monitor the measure – expected to benefit some 12,000 employees – after it takes effect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will review how this works out and see if there is room for improvement, or whether it really affects our work seriously.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister also pointed out that a number of factors have led to a 10-percent vacancy rate in the civil service, and that the government needs more time to deal with the manpower crunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the past few years, we've seen a high retirement wave. It's simply because of the age of civil servants. And also, the number of graduates is not as many as a decade ago. So we have to really compete for talents,” Yeung said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Raphinha hat-trick handed Barcelona a 4-1 win against Bayern Munich in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a clash that pitted five-time winners Barca against six-time champions Bayern, it was the home side that stole the show thanks to a triple from Brazilian attacker Raphinha and a goal from in-form veteran Robert Lewandowski.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harry Kane levelled after Barca's first-minute opener for his fifth goal of the campaign but was helpless as his team collapsed to their second defeat in three Champions League outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In my opinion this game could have been a Champions League final," Raphinha said. "To be able to win it in this way, so well, in front of our fans, is quite special – and I leave here happy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result leaves Bayern in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are 10th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha sent the hosts on their way at the Olympic Stadium inside 60 seconds, tucking home after rounding goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kane levelled in the 18th minute with an acrobatic volley from a Serge Gnabry cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ex-Bayern player Lewandowski then restored Barca's lead in the 36th minute by pouncing on a loose ball after Fermin Lopez had snuck behind the visiting defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha got his second on the stroke of half-time with a curling effort off his right side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brazil international's third on 56 minutes showcased Barca's danger on the counter as he galloped onto a swept pass from Lamine Yamal before arrowing home a left-footed finish with both centre-halves trailing in his wake. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World leaders called for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine at the summit meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said he welcomed offers to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin also said the summit's agenda covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, as well as settling regional conflicts and moving to expand the Bric group of countries. (Agencies)

    Turkey strikes Kurdish militants after deadly attack

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Turkey said it launched strikes on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday after blaming them for an attack that killed five people at a defence firm near Ankara.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A further 22 people were wounded in the attack, which the government said was "very likely" carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours later, "an air operation was carried out against terrorist targets in the north of Iraq and Syria," the defence ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A total of 32 targets belonging to the terrorists were successfully destroyed," it said, adding that operations were continuing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies, the PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state. It has a number of bases in Kurdish regions of Iraq and Syria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the attack that sparked the strikes, a huge explosion rocked the headquarters of state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) some 40 kilometres north of Ankara shortly after 3:30 pm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It sent clouds of smoke into the air as the sound of gunfire rang out, Turkish media reported, with the incident quickly denounced by Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya as a "terror attack."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin, called it a "heinous" attack on Turkey's defence industry "targeting the survival of our country," in a message on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yerlikaya said three of the injured were in critical condition and that the two attackers, "a woman and a man," had been "neutralised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was no immediate claim for the attack but Yerlikaya said: "The way in which this action was carried out is very probably linked to the PKK."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said efforts to identify the perpetrators of the attack were ongoing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defence Minister Yasar Guler also pointed the finger at "PKK villains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As they always do, they tried to disturb our nation's peace through a despicable and dishonourable attack... we will make them suffer for what they have done," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkey's vice president Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. Media reports earlier said the assailants had killed him and taken his taxi to carry out the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An unconfirmed report by private channel NTV said a "group of terrorists" had burst into the building, one of whom "blew himself up" while other outlets reported exchanges of fire for more than an hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haberturk TV said there was a "hostage situation," with another media pundit saying "a number of hostages" had been rescued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turkish authorities imposed a blackout of live images from the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabah newspaper published what it said was a CCTV image from the entrance showing a black-clad young man with a moustache carrying a rucksack and what appeared to be an assault rifle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As night fell, dozens of ambulances could be seen waiting in convoy near the site, their blue lights flashing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of Turkey's top defence firms and a major arms producer, TAI employs 15,500 people and has a vast production site covering an area of five million square metres, its website says.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack drew condemnation from across Turkey and beyond, with Putin offering Erdogan his "condolences in connection with the terror attack" at the start of their meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Statements of condemnation and condolences to the families of the victims also poured in from Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Tehran and Washington and Nato leadership.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack came as Turkey's political establishment appeared to be leaning towards a political, negotiated solution to the decades-long conflict with the Kurdish militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The timing was not lost on the main pro-Kurdish party, Dem, the third largest force in parliament, which said it was "noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It took place a day after the head of the far-right MHP, which belongs to Erdogan's ruling coalition, invited jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to address parliament to announce his movement's dissolution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, claiming tens of thousands of lives, with Ocalan held in solitary confinement on a prison island since 1999. (AFP)

    Haaland leads Man City to 5-0 rout of Sparta Prague

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland's spectacular acrobatic effort lit up Manchester City's 5-0 win over Sparta Prague on Wednesday to move into third place in the Uefa Champions League table.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Norwegian scored twice, including a backheel at shoulder height, as City ran riot against the Czech champions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil Foden, John Stones and Matheus Nunes were also on target for Pep Guardiola's men, who remain unbeaten in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's a freak isn't he," said Foden of Haaland's athleticism. "If I tried to do that I'd pull my groin. I don't know how he did it, I just think it's just his long legs."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sparta had taken four points from their opening two Champions League games against Salzburg and Stuttgart, but City were a step up in class too far for the visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It became painful in the second half after it went to 2-0. It became very difficult and we had difficulty coping with it," said Sparta coach Lars Friis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foden's struggle for form and fitness has compounded City's injury problems with Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had nine efforts on goal in total but was frustrated in the first half as Sparta refused to let the floodgates open before the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Haaland did finally deliver City's second with an effort reminiscent of his strike against old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that won Champions League goal of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was an amazing goal – I was speechless after he shot," said Nunes. "When he scored against Dortmund, I was watching on TV and to see this live was amazing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are now unbeaten from open play in 26 Champions League matches, setting the longest unbeaten streak by any club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victory takes Guardiola's men onto seven points from their opening three Champions League games, behind only Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Villa. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 27th minute tap in from Darwin Núñez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mo Salah hit a perfect header across his body.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Núñez jumped high to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're really happy for the win – we played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts, apart from the last few minutes," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I asked for a goal. Darwin gave us one, but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist," he added. "It was a team goal – it's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ball hit by Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani for his 50th home run of the season sold for a record-breaking US$4.39 million, auction house Goldin said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The home run saw Ohtani become the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit 50 home-runs and steal 50 bases in a single season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Shohei Ohtani made history with this baseball, and now, with the highest sale price for any ball ever sold," Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of the auction house, said in a statement. "This legendary piece of sports memorabilia has made history again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received bids from around the world, a testament to the significance of this iconic collectible and Ohtani's impact on sports," he added. "I'm thrilled for the winning bidder."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The record price for a baseball was previously the US$3.05 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball of 1998.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani's 50th home run of the season came during a spectacular offensive outing for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Marlins in Miami on September 19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had six hits in six at-bats, including two doubles, for a total of five extra-base hits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He drove in 10 runs, scored four himself and stole two bases to help the Dodgers clinch a postseason berth that will mark Ohtani's first trip to the MLB playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani had already stolen two bases in the first two innings to take his tally to 51 for the season when he turned up the power at the plate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He smashed his 49th home run of the season in the sixth inning then established the 50-50 club with a second homer in the seventh – belting a curveball from Mike Baumann into the left field stands at loanDepot Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fan who caught it reportedly turned down the Dodgers' offer to purchase it for US$300,000 and wasted little time in consigning it with Goldin. (AFP)

   LeBron and Bronny became the first father and son to play in the NBA together on Tuesday night during the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener, fulfilling a dream set out a few years ago by LeBron, the top scorer in league history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, it’s a moment I’m never going to forget,” LeBron said. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Father and son checked into the game against Minnesota simultaneously with four minutes left in the second quarter, prompting a big ovation from a home crowd aware of the enormity of the milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old LeBron had already started the game and played 13 minutes before he teamed up with his 20-year-old son for about 2 and a half minutes of action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James is a four-time champion and 20-time All-Star, while LeBron James Jr was a second-round pick by the Lakers last summer. They are the first father and son to play in the world's top basketball league at the same time, let alone on the same team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Y’all ready? You see the intensity, right? Just play carefree, though,” father told son on the bench before they checked in, an exchange captured by the TNT cameras and microphones. “Don’t worry about mistakes. Just go out and play hard.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron contributed 16 points in the Lakers' 110-103 win. Meanwhile, Bronny had an early offensive rebound and missed a tip-in, and his first NBA jump shot moments later was a 3-pointer that came up just short.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He – who, like many first-year players, is not expected to see significant floor time this season – checked out one possession later with 1:19 left in the second quarter, getting another ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “(I) tried not to focus on everything that’s going on around me, and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny said. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. The dream became real after Bronny entered the draft as a teenager following one collegiate season, and the Lakers grabbed him with the 55th overall pick. (AP/Reuters)

    Pelicot trial calls for rape law changes in France

  <div class="itemFullText">
   France may introduce changes to its rape law to include consent for the first time, after a mass rape trial shook the country, challenging the limits of existing legislation and prompting some leading politicians to call for change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot has admitted to drugging his wife and recruiting dozens of men online to rape her while she was unconscious and 50 men are facing trial alongside him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are accused of taking turns on the drugged and inert body of Gisèle Pelicot while her husband recorded the horror for his swelling private video library.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite video evidence against them, at least 35 of the defendants have denied the rape charges, claiming that Dominique Pelicot tricked them into believing they were taking part in a sex game, or that Gisele Pelicot was feigning sleep.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dominique Pelicot denied this, telling the court his co-defendants knew exactly what the situation was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The case has prompted deep soul-searching in France, with consent at the heart of the matter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am determined that things change in this society," Gisele Pelicot told the Avignon court on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gisele Pelicot insisted from the start that the trial should be open to the public, and has encouraged other women who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wanted all women who are rape victims to say to themselves 'Mrs Pelicot did it, so we can do it too'," she said. "It's not us who should feel shame, but them (the perpetrators).”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France’s new Justice Minister Didier Migaud recently said he is in favour of updating the law, as has President Emmanuel Macron, after France blocked the inclusion of a consent-based rape definition in a European directive in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I believe it is beyond understanding for our fellow citizens to refuse to include consent in the definition of rape," Migaud told lawmakers earlier this month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 2023 survey by one of France's main polling institutes, IFOP, found that nine out of 10 people polled wanted France to support the EU directive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Consent-based rape law already exists in Sweden, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and more than a dozen other European countries, with the rise of the feminist #MeToo movement prompting legislative reform in some jurisdictions since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, French criminal law defines rape as a penetrative act or oral sex act committed on someone using "violence, coercion, threat or surprise." It makes no clear mention of the need for a partner's consent and prosecutors must prove the intention to rape to secure a guilty verdict, five legal experts said. (Agencies)
