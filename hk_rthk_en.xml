 Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau on Sunday said casino revenues rose by almost a quarter in 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau showed gaming revenue last year coming in at 227 billion patacas, 23.9 percent higher than it 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  That topped the government's estimate of 216 billion patacas, but trailed the 292.5 billion logged prior to the pandemic in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, is now looking to diversify its economy through new industries and increased integration with the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its economy is heavily reliant on casinos, which contribute about 80 percent of tax revenues. (additional reporting by Reuters)

    Hong Kong brings back 3pc hotel accommodation tax

<img alt="The Hotel Accommodation Tax had been suspended since 2008. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785775_1_20250101180654.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Wednesday brought back the three percent accommodation tax which had been suspended since July 2008.
 <br>
  <br>
  While some tourists called the tax rate acceptable, others were unhappy that the extra charge wasn't clearly stipulated on booking websites.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hotel in Wan Chai, a mainland tourist who's checking in said he finds the tax rate acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's fine, I respect your system here. The platform shows the tax added to the price and reminds you. For overseas consumption, we always pay tax in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another tourist told RTHK that the tax wasn't clearly indicated on some online booking platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the platforms should show the tax amount in brackets, or show the prices with and without tax, then consumers would know," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the key is to make the tax collection process as straightforward as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government hasn't specified how to collect it. Some hotels want to save costs, so they collect at the front desk. We need to decide whether to make it more complex by collecting at the front desk or collect it all through online travel agents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui also hopes the government will consider lowering the tax rate when public finances improve.

    Syria working towards a free press, says minister

<img alt="Mohamed al-Omar made the comment in an interview. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785777_1_20250101182333.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's minister of information in the country's transitional government told AFP he is working towards a free press and committed to "freedom of expression", after decades of tight control under the country's former rulers.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to consolidate freedoms of the press and expression that were severely restricted" in areas controlled by the former government of Bashar al-Assad, said the minister, Mohamed al-Omar, after Islamist-led rebels on December 8 ended more than five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's ruling Baath party and the Assad family dynasty heavily curtailed all aspects of daily life, including freedom of the press and expression with the media a tool of those in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reporters Without Borders, a freedom of information watchdog, ranked Syria second-last on its 2024 World Press Freedom Index, ahead only of Eritrea and behind Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a heavy restriction on freedom of the press and expression under the regime which practised censorship. In the period to come we are working on the reconstruction of a media landscape that is free, objective and professional," Omar said during an interview with AFP on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is part of the interim administration installed in Damascus by the victorious rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has its origins in the Syrian branch of the jihadist group Al-Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organisation by numerous governments, but has sought to soften its image in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats from around the region and from the West have made contact with Syria's new rulers, who have also vowed to protect the country's religious and ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Omar was previously minister of information in the self-proclaimed Salvation Government, the civil administration set up in 2017 by HTS in the rebel holdout of Idlib province, in Syria's northwest. It was from Idlib that the rebels began their lightning advance towards Damascus, 13 years into the country's civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the conflict erupted in 2011 with the government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests, Assad tightened restrictions on independent journalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want to continue in the same way, that is, have an official media whose aim is to polish the image of the ruling power," Omar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Assad's overthrow and flight to Moscow, Syrian media outlets which had trumpeted his regime's glories quickly adopted a revolutionary fervour.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Omar held an exchange with dozens of Syrian journalists to discuss the transition. (AFP)

    Investigators vow to execute warrant for Yoon

<img alt="A supporter of impeached South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol holds up a placard. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785766_1_20250101162556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators said on Wednesday they would execute an arrest warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law by the deadline of January 6, as the impeached leader's supporters rallied outside his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Supporters and opponents of Yoon, who was suspended from office by lawmakers over his attempt to subvert civilian rule last month, have been camped outside the compound where he has been holed up for weeks, fending off investigators' efforts to question him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) requested the warrant after Yoon failed to report for questioning a third time, but it has been unclear whether they could execute it as the Presidential Security Service has previously refused to comply with search warrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  CIO chief Oh Dong-woon said on Wednesday the warrant would be executed "within the deadline", which is on Monday, January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim for a smooth process without major disturbances, but we are also coordinating to mobilise police and personnel in preparation," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon could themselves face prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider actions such as setting up various barricades and locking iron gates to resist the execution of our arrest warrant as obstruction of official duties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyone doing this "could be prosecuted under charges of abuse of authority interfering with the exercise of rights and obstruction of official duties by special means", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's legal team have filed for an injunction to block the warrant and claimed on Wednesday the arrest order was "an unlawful and invalid act", lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's die-hard supporters raced to Seoul to support him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the presidential compound dozens of people -- some in elaborate costume -- could be seen chanting, singing and hurling vitriol at police.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, some attempted to break through a cordon and block a police bus from parking near the entrance -- apparently mistaking it for the mobile force that may be dispatched to detain Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were sent to the area in large numbers and could be seen yelling at protesters to keep in line, but a route in and out of Yoon's residence remained clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have previously failed to execute arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police from entering for the seven-day period the warrant was valid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the majority of Yoon's remaining staff, including his chief of staff and special advisors, all tendered their resignations to the country's acting president -- who rejected them, calling instead for unity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a time for everyone to come together for the stability of the livelihood of the people and national affairs," acting president Choi Sang-mok said
  <br>
  <br>
  The resignations were a show of discontent over Choi's decision to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court hearing Yoon's impeachment -- meeting a key demand of the opposition, but branded an overstepping of the powers of the acting leader by Yoon's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president declared martial law in a televised address, saying it was aimed at eliminating "anti-state elements" but lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil deepened late last week when Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi took office on Friday and found himself thrust immediately into a disaster with the Jeju Air plane crash on Sunday that claimed 179 lives. (AFP)

    'Arrangements at border control points were smooth'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said arrangements at border control points were smooth, as travellers returned to the mainland in the early hours of January 1 following countdown celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Bay Control Point operated overnight; and the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, extended its service hours to 2am. The operation of the East Rail line was also extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said 400,000 people watched the fireworks display over Victoria Harbour. It added that between midnight and 6:30am, around 25,000 mainland visitors departed Hong Kong via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the tourists RTHK spoke to said they were satisfied with the transport arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year when many visitors were left stranded after trains stopped running, one said everything was a lot smoother this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stuck here last year... for four to five hours. We also celebrated the New Year [in Hong Kong] last year. It's more convenient this year," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another traveller said thanks to the extension of service hours on the East Rail line and the Lo Wu Control Point, he could return to the mainland easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If not, I would have to go to Mong Kok to take the overnight bus, so I saved about an hour," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security chief Chris Tang, who earlier inspected the Lo Wu crossing, said he was pleased that visitors were able to cross the border smoothly and quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether MTR lines and control points can further extend their service hours in future, he said the authorities have to consider different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for all border control points to operate overnight. We have to look at the necessity, and how we utilise our resources," Tang said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The inaugural flights of the domestically-produced C919 aircraft between Shanghai and Hong Kong have opened a "new chapter" for the SAR as an international aviation hub, transport and logistics chief Mable Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first flight that took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport arrived in the SAR shortly before 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, Chan said she feels honoured to witness the historic moment on New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the first city beyond the other mainland cities to have this kind of commercial flight. So we are especially happy to see this flight materialise on the first day of 2025," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that through this commercial flight, we can bring this historical innovation breakthrough in the mainland's production of civil aviation aircraft to our Hong Kong citizens, as well as to the international visitors coming to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR has what it takes to shine as an aviation engineering hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong International Airport has rich experience and comprehensive facilities to fully support the maintenance of domestically produced aircraft in Hong Kong and overseas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Secondly, the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy is an important aviation talent training base in the Asia region. The academy is planning to expand training to cover C919 aircraft, which will help domestically-produced planes enter overseas markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport chief also said the government is looking to further develop the aircraft leasing market by rolling out various tax incentives, to help homegrown aircraft go global.

 A domestically-produced C919 aircraft has completed its first commercial flight to Hong Kong amid much fanfare.
 <br>
  <br>
  The homegrown passenger jet, operated by China Eastern airlines and carrying around 160 passengers, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 8.15am on Sunday and landed in the SAR about two and a half hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers were treated to an exceptional travel experience, with each of them receiving a special framed boarding pass – printed with the flight number, date, as well as the letters “C919” - as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those on-board the full flight was Ryan, who flew on the C919 aircraft for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m also a citizen of Hong Kong. It feels really special. Shanghai is my hometown and Hong Kong is like my second hometown. It’s really special to be able to experience the Chinese manufactured C919 on this flight,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan described the flight experience as being “impressively good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am quite fortunate to get the bulkhead seat. It has plenty of leg room which is nice on a narrow-body jet. Looking back, the leg room is also big [for other seats] and the tray table is pretty nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  13-year-old Joe, a flying enthusiast, flew solo.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the control of noise is very nice. Because it’s the first aircraft of China and in some ways it’s even better than Boeing and Airbus. The seats… are really comfortable,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meal was really good... We had this sort of Shanghai cake and another cake that had C919 letters on it and it was very delicious.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other passengers like Gin and his son Harrison, who just happened to be on this maiden flight, said they were impressed with the flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it would be very loud but the noise wasn’t big at all. The seats were quite spacious,” six-year-old Harrison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the captain of the inaugural flight, Shang Feng, told RTHK that he's honoured and excited to take passengers to Hong Kong on board the C919.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is our ninth destination with C919. Over the last two years, C919 has been flying to major airports in mainland cities and it fully showcases its ability to adapt and operate smoothly in different locations. I believe future regular flights to Hong Kong will be smooth,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern said it will be using the C919 jet for one round-trip flight between Shanghai and Hong Kong per day, with the return trip scheduled for departure at 12.55pm.

<img alt="Sunday's Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport was the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785745_1_20250101115248.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing a Jeju Air crash which killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil have extracted the initial data from one of the Boeing 737-800's black boxes, an official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting a barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing over the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of the plane's black boxes were retrieved, and for the cockpit voice recorder, "the initial extraction has already been completed," said deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this preliminary data, we plan to start converting it into audio format," he said, meaning investigators would be able to hear the pilots' final communications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second black box, the flight data recorder, "was found with a missing connector," Joo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts are currently conducting a final review to determine how to extract data from it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause of the disaster, but they have since said the probe was also examining a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which dramatic video showed the Boeing 737-800 colliding with before bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have also been questions over possible mechanical failures, with local media reporting that the landing gear had deployed properly on Jeju Air Flight 2216's first failed landing attempt at Muan airport before failing on the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue "will likely be examined by the Accident Investigation Board through a comprehensive review of various testimonies and evidence during the investigation process," the ministry of land, which oversees civil aviation, said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Muan airport, grieving families of victims had become increasingly frustrated by delays in identifying and releasing the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said the bodies were extensively damaged by the crash, making the work of identifying remains slow and immensely difficult, even as investigators had to preserve crash-site evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the country's acting president said on Wednesday the process had finally been completed, and that more bodies had been handed over to relatives so that they could hold funerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the identification of all 179 victims was completed," said acting president Choi Sang-mok, who has been in office less than a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigators, along with the US National Transportation Safety Board and the manufacturer, are conducting a joint investigation into the cause of the accident," Choi said at a disaster response meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A comprehensive analysis and review of the aircraft's structure and the black box data will reveal the cause of the accident," Choi added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US investigators had arrived on Monday and headed straight to Muan, with the initial on-site joint probe focusing on a navigation system that assists in aircraft landings, known as a localiser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser, installed on a concrete structure at Muan International Airport, is the barrier that has been blamed for exacerbating the severity of the Jeju Air crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was largely carrying holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, with all passengers Korean nationals except for two Thais.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fuller account of what went wrong in the flight's final moments is expected once authorities have analysed the black boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Memorial altars for the victims have been set up nationwide, including in Seoul and at Muan airport. (AFP)

<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee says on a video posted on social media that many good things happened to Hong Kong in 2024." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785741_1_20250101111607.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government will focus on reforming and improving people's livelihoods in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his New Year message through a video, Lee described 2024 as a historical year for Hong Kong, with many good things happening, including the completion of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted new momentum for the economy, such as the two giant pandas gifted by the central authorities, the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and the commencement of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that his administration also worked on building more flats, came up with a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided units, and set up community living rooms to cater for the needs of the grassroots community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the CE said his government has several main goals this year -- reform and embrace changes, strengthen the SAR's connectivity with the mainland and the world; as well as improve people's livelihoods and foster harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Facing drastic changes both in the external and internal environments, Hong Kong must understand, respond to and embrace them, while taking the initiative to align with national development strategies," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will strengthen our exchanges and cooperation with the world, open up to new markets, strengthen regional cooperation, and continue to boost our international influence."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone will start operating this year, marking a milestone for the SAR as an international I&T centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that 9,500 light public housing units and three more community living rooms will be made available this year, while Hong Kong's first Chinese medicine hospital will commence operation in phases this year.

 Three men died after a taxi collided with a private car in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before 2 am, both cars were travelling along the West Kowloon Highway towards the Western Harbour Crossing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Near Olympic MTR Station the taxi reportedly swerved into the other vehicle's lane and hit it, causing it to go out of control, ram a concrete divider, and smash into a moving taxi and three stationary vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The car driver was certified dead at the scene, while two of his four male passengers were certified dead at Princess Margaret Hospital about an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two other car passengers, along with the two in the taxi, were sent to hospital for treatment for a variety of injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 From Sydney to Mumbai to Nairobi, communities around the world began welcoming 2025 with spectacular light shows, embraces and ice plunges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auckland became the first major city to celebrate, as thousands thronged downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point. A light display recognised Indigenous people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean were the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conflict muted acknowledgements of the start of 2025 in places like the Middle East, Sudan and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks blasted off the Sydney Harbour Bridge and across the bay. More than a million Australians and others gathered at the iconic Sydney Harbour for the celebration. British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebration also featured Indigenous ceremonies and performances that acknowledged the land’s first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Japan shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth – alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Other places in Asia will mark the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or cancelled during a period of national mourning following Sunday's crash of a Jeju Air flight in Muan that killed 179 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand's Bangkok, shopping malls competed for crowds with live musical acts and fireworks shows. A fireworks display in Indonesia's Jakarta featured 800 drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year’s greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of the growing closeness between the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Putin their countries will “always move forward hand in hand,” the official Xinhua News Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In India, thousands of revellers in the financial hub of Mumbai flocked to the city's bustling promenade facing the Arabian Sea. In Sri Lanka, people gathered at Buddhist temples to light oil lamps and incense sticks and pray.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Dubai, thousands attended a fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. And in Nairobi, Kenya, scattered fireworks were heard as midnight approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to again appeal for peace in Ukraine and the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris capped a momentous 2024 with its traditional countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the Champs-Elysées. The city’s emblematic Arc de Triomphe monument was turned into a giant tableau for a light show that celebrated the city's landmarks and the passage of time, with whirring clocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Paris is a party,” proclaimed Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September had transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank and Rowena Klar from San Francisco visited the French capital to celebrate 31 years together. “If you start it big, we think we’re going to have a great year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rang in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Switzerland and some other places, people embraced the cold, stripping and plunging into the water in freezing temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with ferries offshore launching 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists on cruise ships will witness the show up close.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2 million people were expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York City, the organisation managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Las Vegas' pyrotechnic show will be on the Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of casinos. Nearby, the Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pasadena, California, Rose Parade spectators were camping out and hoping for prime spots. And some 200,000 people were flocking to a country music party in Nashville, Tennessee.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Samoa will be among the last to welcome 2025, a full 24 hours after New Zealand. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce led all players in fan voting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelce, whose romance with Taylor Swift brought the NFL to the attention of the pop megastar's legion of fans, finished with 252,200 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs was second overall with 250,082 votes and Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has helped the Commanders into the playoffs, was third with 242,352.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions led all clubs in total votes received, followed by the Minnesota Vikings, Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selections for the Pro Bowl Games rosters for the AFC and NFC are determined by a combination of voting by fans, players and coaches, with each group's vote counting for one-third of the tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL's all-star event will be staged February 2 in Orlando, Florida, for the second consecutive year as 88 players take part in skills competitions, including a flag football showdown with former NFL star quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning serving as coaches. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Famed actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie signed off on a divorce settlement on Monday, according to US media, marking a turning point in the eight-year legal saga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed the settlement to People Magazine, saying in a statement that Jolie was "focused on finding peace and healing for their family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago," Simon said. "Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  No details of the settlement between the former power couple were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed to dissolve their marriage in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed for divorce a few days after a flight during which she alleged in court papers that Pitt "choked" one of their children and hit another during a plane fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the papers lodged in a Los Angeles court and widely quoted in US media, Jolie describes a lengthy eruption by Pitt as the couple flew with the children from California to France in September 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the ensuing years, the A-listers have clashed over custody of the children – three biological and three adopted – and more recently over the ownership of a luxury French property they bought together.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, the couple reached a custody arrangement for their six children, three of whom are adopted, though it appears to have since unravelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitt and Jolie first got together after co-starring as married assassins in the 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs Smith." Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday to end 2024 on a gloomy note, but investors capped a strong overall year that was boosted by tech stocks, interest rate cuts and a robust US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.1 percent to 42,544, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.4 percent to 5,881.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent to 19,310.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was kind of a disappointing end to the year," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, noting that markets have closed lower for a few consecutive days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed the selling in recent days involved "some large portfolios reallocating money from stocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "this year was phenomenal" overall, he said, noting that major indexes moved higher and major tech stocks dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key factors included semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks, with enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping the "Magnificent Seven" US tech heavyweights – which include Apple and Nvidia – this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns about the pace of US interest rate cuts and uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump's trade and tariff agenda could cloud the outlook, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sosnick believed "there's a lot of optimism about the coming year." (AFP)

 Hong Kong welcomed 2025 with a colourful fireworks display over Victoria Harbour as hundreds of thousands around the city celebrated the arrival of the new year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "The Symphony of Happiness", the 12-minute show was in five parts. It kicked off with bright red fireworks, symbolising a fiery passion for life and dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second section used pyrotechnic technology, creating the effect of flowers blooming one after another. This was followed by green and gold fireworks, showing an evergreen tree representing the spirit of strong perseverance, hard work and quiet cultivation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth part was named the "Golden Waterfall". It took the form of golden fireworks cascading down the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final section - "Propitious Clouds" - was making its debut in Hong Kong. It took the form of rainbow-coloured smoke with silver fireworks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney welcomed 2025 with a massive fireworks display at its iconic harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The self-proclaimed "New Year's capital of the world", sprayed nine tonnes of fireworks from its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge at midnight, creating a spectacle that was awash with vibrant colours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said more than a million people gathered to watch the display as British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong while Indigenous ceremonies and performances acknowledged the land's first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Auckland became the first major city to ring in the new year, with thousands of revellers counting down to 2025 and cheering at colourful fireworks launched from New Zealand’s tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display recognising Auckland’s Indigenous tribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of five million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. (Agencies)

 Crowds of citizens and tourists gathered along Victoria Harbour on Tuesday for the New Year's Eve fireworks display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crowd control measures were in place with a number of exits at Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stations temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some mainland tourists were excited for the fireworks display. They also found the countdown celebrations in Hong Kong “lively”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-minute show will cover a distance of 1,300 metres from Central to North Point. The fireworks will be launched at different heights and angles by five barges and 16 pontoons, arranged in two rows on the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Service hours at the Lo Wu Control Point will be extended to 2am, while the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will stay open throughout the night, to facilitate tourist flows.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Plymouth Argyle have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Wayne Rooney after just over seven months in charge, the second-tier Championship club said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rooney had replaced Ian Foster in May on a three-year deal at Plymouth. However, the team struggled under his leadership, failing to win away this season, and are bottom with 18 points from 23 games, four points adrift of the safety zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United and England forward oversaw 25 matches in all competitions before his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the second setback for Rooney in 2024 following his dismissal as Birmingham City head coach in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First team coach Kevin Nancekivell and club captain Joe Edwards will lead the team for our Championship match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day," Plymouth said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rooney added: "Plymouth Argyle will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to look out for and take interest in their results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Birmingham manager in October 2023 when they were sixth but sacked in January after they fell to 20th in the league.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight attendant aboard a Swiss aircraft that made an emergency landing in Austria last week due to smoke in the cabin has died, the airline said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flight from Bucharest to Zurich on December 23 was diverted to Graz after engine problems and smoke filled the cockpit and the cabin, Swiss International Air Lines said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the attendant died on Monday in intensive care in the hospital in Graz. The attendant was one of two crew members who were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 74 passengers aboard the Airbus A220-300 were evacuated after flight LX1885 landed safely, Swiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are devastated at our dear colleague’s death,” Swiss Chief Executive Officer Jens Fehlinger said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His loss has left us all in the deepest shock and grief. Our thoughts are with his family, whose pain we cannot imagine. I offer them my heartfelt condolences on behalf of all of us at Swiss."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public prosecutor's office in Graz has ordered a forensic examination of the attendant's body, Austria's APA news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also appointed an aviation expert and initiated an investigation into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the incident, Swiss said it was also conducting an internal examination.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want to thoroughly clarify the causes of the smoke and the effects on passengers and crew,” the airline wrote on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The focus is on the mechanical parts of the aircraft, such as the engine, but also on the use of protective equipment for the cabin crew, known as Protective Breathing Equipment.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said that China's economy faced the "pressure of transformation" but could overcome this through hard work, in his annual New Year's speech broadcast to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The current economic operation faces some new situations, challenges from the uncertainty of the external environment, and pressure of transformation from old drivers of growth into new ones, but these can be overcome through hard work," he said in an address broadcast on state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the economy had rebounded and was on an upward trajectory, with its GDP expected to exceed US$17.8 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said the country had fostered new quality productive forces and had seen new business sectors, forms and models emerging.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's annual production of new energy vehicles topped 10 million for the first time in 2024, while the country made breakthroughs in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields, Xi said in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi reiterated China's commitment to promoting global governance reform and contributing to the maintenance of world peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world of both transformation and turbulence, China, as a responsible major country, is actively promoting global governance reform and deepening solidarity and cooperation among the Global South," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said "Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties, and no one can stop the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president pledged China would unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau. (Xinhua/AFP)

<img alt="Investigators from South Korea and the US, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, inspect the Jeju Air plane wreckage in Muan. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785658_1_20241231191117.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Tuesday said they were investigating the role of a concrete barrier at the end of Muan airport runway in the country's worst air disaster, which killed 179 people as a Jeju Air jet crashed on landing.
 <br>
  <br>
  US investigators, including from Boeing, were at the crash site in southwestern Muan, officials said, as South Korean authorities began assessing two black boxes retrieved from the burned-out wreckage of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it made a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting the barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok, who has only been in office since Friday, said the accident was a "turning point" for the country, calling for a full overhaul of air safety systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged officials to "thoroughly re-examine the overall aircraft operation system... and immediately address any necessary improvements."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause, but experts have also flagged the barrier, with dramatic video showing the Boeing 737-800 bursting into flames as it collides with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether it was permissible for the airport to have used concrete in the barrier, director-general for airport policy Kim Hong-rak said the government would "review the relevant regulations and their application".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether this structure exacerbated the damage is... something the Accident Investigation Committee plans to investigate thoroughly," said deputy minister for civil aviation, Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this stage, it is important to avoid focusing solely on any particular factor as the definitive cause of the accident," he said, adding investigators were reviewing "all potential scenarios to ensure a thorough investigation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae said that there were "no specific or unusual issues during the maintenance process" of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for whether the landing gear functioned properly, that is directly related to the accident investigation, and we are not in a position to know at this time," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is observing seven days of mourning over the disaster, with New Year celebrations cancelled and flags flying at half-mast. (AFP)

    China manufacturing continues expansion in December

<img alt="Chinese manufacturing activity continued to expand in December, although at a slower rate than in November. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785626_1_20241231161725.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new commissioner for customs and excise, Chan Tsz-tat, said on Tuesday that safeguarding national security is among the key areas of work for his team.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, 54, was appointed by the State Council in the morning to take over from Louise Ho who is retiring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officers are well-trained to be able to detect materials at the border that are suspected of violating security laws, and they can then pass on cases to relevant bodies for follow-up action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, he also said targeting the newly popular drug, space oil, is another important focus for officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are fully aware of this new drug, which has become more popular in the market. So we have stepped up our enforcement on all fronts," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Up to December 22, we have arrested 12 persons, with seizures which will be able to produce as much as over 70,000 capsules for smoking by electronic devices."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new commissioner also said that so far this year, officers have dealt with some 19,000 cases of illicit cigarette smuggling at the border, nearly double the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By intercepting passengers who bring in excessive cigarettes, it's a very effective means to protect government revenue," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course we're currently working against syndicate crimes. We'll put more resources into the detection and investigation of major smuggling syndicates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said other major areas of work include facilitating trade and convenient border-crossing, as well as cooperation with international customs bodies so the SAR can have a bigger say in international customs affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will work on internal team building and has already met seven staff-side unions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said he was very honoured to be recommended for the post by Chief Executive John Lee and appointed by Beijing, adding that he cherishes the opportunity to lead the department.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Hart delivered his third triple double of the season on to spark the New York Knicks in a 126-106 victory at Washington that stretched their win streak to eight games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hart had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his ninth triple double with the Knicks while Karl-Anthony Towns had a game-high 32 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson and O.G. Anunoby each scored 18 points for New York, which improved to 23-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks led 59-57 at halftime over the Eastern Conference doormats, and pulled away in the third quarter and dominated the fourth to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We executed. We got stops and we played fast," Hart said. "We played to our strengths. Sometimes it takes us a little while to wake up – we always do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at New Orleans, James Harden sank four free throws in the final 17 seconds to give the Los Angeles Clippers a 116-113 victory over the host Pelicans – as the NBA's worst club dropped a 10th consecutive game to sink to 5-28 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norman Powell scored a game-high 35 points, while Harden added 27 as the Clippers improved to 19-13.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for impeached, suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, investigators said on Tuesday, over his short-lived bid to impose martial law on the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, requested by the Joint Investigation Headquarters, were issued this morning," the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators probing Yoon over his declaration of martial law requested the warrant on Monday after the suspended president failed to report for questioning a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime," a Corruption Investigation Office official told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The warrant is valid until January 6," the official said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer called the arrest warrant for the impeached president "illegal and invalid", saying investigators lacked the authority to probe the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid," a statement from lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has stressed that any operator is welcome to take part in a tendering exercise next year for the management of Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, adding that the existing firm would have to bring something new to the table if it wanted to stay on.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they will put managing rights of the terminal up for tender three years before the existing contract expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also review the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement to make the cruise terminal more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the existing operator wants to join the tendering exercise, we'll review its performance over the years. We'll also look at whether the operator can adapt to the current situation, and offer new insights and suggestions," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for who will end up winning the bid, we're keeping an open mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed it would be too late to launch a tender exercise in 2027 being as the current agreement ends in May 2028, saying authorities have to give the new operator sufficient preparation time before taking over.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The State Council on Tuesday appointed Chan Tsz-tat as the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, replacing Louise Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan joined the department as an inspector in 1994. He became an assistant commissioner in 2020, and was promoted to deputy commissioner two years later, responsible for the force's management and strategic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence in Chan's ability to lead Customs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Chan has served in the Customs and Excise Department for 30 years and has extensive experience in departmental operations. He possesses solid management and leadership skills," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also conveyed his appreciation to Ho for her contributions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, 57, has proceeded on pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined Customs in 1991, and became Hong Kong's first female Customs chief in 2021.

    'C919 can help HK grow into aviation engineering hub'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland aviation specialist says using the domestically-produced C919 aircraft for daily flights in Hong Kong will help the SAR become an aviation engineering hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern Airlines is deploying the narrow-body passenger jet on a direct route between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the first set of flights due to take off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past 50 or 60 years, Hong Kong has worked as an [aviation hub], but due to the lack of a local aircraft manufacturer, it is not an aircraft or aviation engineering hub," Jason Li told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, was increasing its engineering investment in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, as you can see... COMAC is putting more China-produced C919 into Hong Kong. They are building an engineering team in Hong Kong," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can see that aviation [requires] a comprehensive engineering team. There are so many different parts; mechanical, electronic etc. So there will be much more career opportunities for local young people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the choice of Hong Kong as the C919's first destination outside mainland China shows the city's important role in advancing the national aviation sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is encouraging and letting more enterprises demonstrate their newest technology and the business in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong's status as an international city meant the C919 would have more exposure to overseas clientele, such as those from Southeast Asia, the United States, and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said he expected more C919 jets flying into Hong Kong in the next couple of years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China Eastern Airlines currently has 10 C919s... I expect that in 2025, when they reach about 15 or 20, there will be an extra pair from Shanghai to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for other carriers, for example Air China or China Southern Airlines - if they reach about five or 10 C919s - there will be flights from Beijing to Hong Kong."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should urgently address its ageing population as well as issues that come with demographic changes, according to family experts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024, the experts also issued a warning about how declining fertility rates and rising life expectancies would affect the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rapid ageing is impacting all continents, especially Asia, where longevity has increased dramatically. And that's impacting care systems ... and investments have to be made," said Renata Kaczmarska, a social affairs officer at the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demographic changes was one of four "megatrends" that the three-day conference looked at. The others were new technologies, urbanisation and migration, as well as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patricia Chu, co-chairperson of the summit, said the four were not standalone issues and that Hong Kong had to deal with an ageing society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[An] ageing population and demographic changes are the top priority... I think the government is aware of this and they are beginning to do more
  <br>
  ... on this front," said Chu, who also chairs the Consortium of Institutes on Family in the Asian Region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How [to] prepare and help the older generation to make the best use of [information and communication technology] is also another issue, which is integrated with the ageing population," she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and Ukraine swapped more than 300 prisoners of war on Monday in an exchange brokered by the United Arab Emirates ahead of New Year's Eve, officials from both countries said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have exchanged hundreds of captive soldiers since Russia began its military assault on Ukraine in February 2022, in one of the few areas of cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On 30 December, as a result of the negotiation process, 150 Russian servicemen were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, 150 Ukrainian army prisoners of war were handed over," the Russian defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv received 189 people as part of the deal, including soldiers, border guards and two civilians from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to free everyone from Russian captivity. This is our goal. We do not forget anyone," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Monday that Moscow had released a total of 3,956 people - soldiers and civilians - in deals with Kyiv since the start of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides said the latest exchange had been brokered by the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video published by Russia's human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova showed soldiers gathered outside buses, wearing winter clothes and military fatigues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you for your service, patience and courage," Moskalkova said, wishing them a happy New Year's holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very soon our guys will embrace their relatives and friends and celebrate the New Year in their native land," she wrote in a Telegram message accompanying the video. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury verdict ordering US President-elect Donald Trump to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.
 <br>
  <br>
  A New York jury found after a nine-day civil trial last year that the former president had sexually abused Carroll at a Manhattan department store in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was ordered to pay US$2 million for sexual abuse and another US$3 million for defaming Carroll, a former advice columnist for Elle magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict on the grounds that two other women who said Trump had sexually assaulted them too should not have been allowed to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-judge panel of the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conclude that Mr Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carroll was awarded US$83 million by another jury in a separate case she brought against Trump. He has also appealed that verdict. (AFP)

    Villa held by Brighton after late Lamptey equaliser

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.

  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.

  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)

 US markets closed lower on the penultimate trading day of a year in which the benchmark indices have notched up strong gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.0 percent to 42,573.73, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 5,906.94, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.2 percent to 19,486.79.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sam Stovall of CFRA stressed that there was no major catalyst behind the shift, and the lead-up to New Year's Day was typically a low-volume period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, he expected that investors would be closely eyeing data that could give the US Federal Reserve reason to hold back on rate cuts, such as consumer inflation readings.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets have already reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls, investors are also monitoring further details of his trade policy -- after his threats of sweeping new tariffs on imports.
  <br>

  Some major tech stocks slumped Monday, with Tesla shares dropping 3.3 percent and Facebook parent Meta losing 1.4 percent. (AFP)

    Govt appeals ruling on golf course flats plan

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it's appealing the ruling for the sake of public interest. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785522_1_20241230210005.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday that it has lodged an appeal against the High Court’s recent ruling that overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the month, the court ruled in favour of the Golf Club and ordered the administration to relaunch a public consultation on the project’s impact on the environment, citing flaws in its environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, both the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) are appealing against the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ruling would have significant systemic impacts on ongoing and future environmental impact assessments, in particular, it may lead to serious delays in development, operation and execution of the development proposals," the EPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, noted that while officials had already secured enough land to meet the housing supply target for the next decade, an appeal is crucial because the ruling has far-reaching implications.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This appeal is not solely for the proposed housing project but, more importantly, for seeking clarifications from the Court of Appeal on important subjects concerning the principles and legal issues of the EIA framework. The government policy is to strike a balance between environmental protection and development for the overall benefit of Hong Kong,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had originally planned to build 12,000 public housing units at the site.

<img alt="Officials want the value the tourism sector adds to the economy to rise by 60 percent to HK$120 billion in five years. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785501_1_20241230173647.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday said it wants to nurture and develop tourism by focusing on culture, sports, ecotourism and mega-events, with a view to boost the economy by HK$120 billion and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in five years.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they would promote smart tourism - such as introducing virtual reality elements at tourism attractions - to improve the experience of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strategy would be to strengthen the city's appeal in traditional markets like the mainland, while attracting more travellers from the Middle East and Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants to attract more visitors who stay overnight instead of only making day trips to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In five years, officials want a near 60 percent rise in the value the tourism sector adds to the economy, from last year’s base, to HK$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said there was a need to highlight the unique elements of the SAR, such as emphasising the city’s East-meets-West culture to promote tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Hong Kong’s beautiful shoreline, she said, officials would actively look into developing resort projects in the outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will use our different routes to bring more tourists to our coastal landforms, our ecoparks, and also our beautiful seashore area in Sai Kung, and also on Lamma [Island] and Cheung Chau, all these areas, on Lantau," the minister told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will explore with other departments, the possibility of developing larger-scale ecotourism facilities such as hotels, spas or other facilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government plans to promote horse-racing and cruise tourism while enriching some of the city's famous urban walking routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in five years' time, the government expects the sector to have created 210,000 jobs, a more than 40 percent rise from last year's figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that regulators would look into changing the tour guide licensing regime, with a view to attract more new talent to the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, guides need to obtain a full licence by passing different tests on areas like ecotourism or history, but officials are now considering offering partial licences to aspiring guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’m pleased to hear that the [Travel Industry Authority] is considering a partial licence, so that people with a specific interest could actually focus on their areas of interest. By then, I hope that we’ll be able to attract and facilitate more people joining the tourism workforce," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government would otherwise import workers to the trade through existing labour schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical experts are calling on the public to maintain good hygiene and get flu jabs, after clinics reported a surge in infections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Hong Kong Medical Association, Cheng Chi-man, said on a RTHK programme on Monday that clinics have seen a significant increase in patients in the last two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said the SAR may see a more serious flu outbreak if temperatures drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winter in Hong Kong is generally mild. This Lunar New Year in January, the flu outbreak could be less serious as long as the weather isn't that cold and temperatures just fall to between 10 and 15 degrees" he said on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if temperatures dip below 10 degrees, the outbreak could happen quickly and it could be more serious than in the past.”

    China expresses 'deep condolences' over Carter's death

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

    Govt to shift focus to talent retention: Chris Sun

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun says the government will shift its focus from luring talent to retaining talent in the SAR, adding the talent hunt will continue beyond international sports stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Sun also said there are no plans to expand labour importation schemes to cover more sectors other than construction, transport and care homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, snooker stars Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan both became Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the fact that international sports stars come to Hong Kong via various talent admission schemes shows how attractive the city is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are internationally renowned sports stars and foreigners. They have many choices, but they chose Hong Kong. I believe this is the best way to show the world Hong Kong's appeal. It speaks louder than words," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our talent search, not limited to sports stars. Through our talent schemes, we are searching for some world-class talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late 2022, around 175,000 people have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, adding around 350,000 to the city's population along with their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief added there are no plans to provide housing allowances for imported professionals as the government makes housing a priority for local permanent residents.

  TDC research director Irina Fan on Monday said Hong Kong is Indonesia's second largest investor, but the country is only the SAR's sixth largest trading partner when it comes to Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of the enterprises that invest in Indonesia through Hong Kong are mainland subsidiaries or branches in the SAR. Their parent company is on the mainland, but they enter the Indonesian market through Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said figures from Indonesian officials show the SAR invested a total of US$18.5 billion in over 8,400 projects in the country between 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that Indonesia has been participating in the TDC's exhibitions, with products such as clothing, electronics and toys, showing that firms there are very much interested in reaching out to buyers from the mainland and elsewhere.

 A driver involved in a fatal crash in Jordan was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death, police said on Monday, after one person was killed and two other pedestrians were injured when the car he was driving mounted a pavement in Jordan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were notified at around 10am of the incident near Luen Tak Building on Jordan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vehicle was reportedly travelling westbound on the road before ploughing into pedestrians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When approaching the junction of Jordan Road and Shanghai Street, the private car reportedly went out of control and knocked down three pedestrians after running onto the pavement," a police statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three were rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, an elderly person who was found unconscious, was pronounced dead after sustaining multiple serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver, 42, reported feeling unwell and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the crash as a fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said the accident resulted in a stretch of Jordan Road to be closed to traffic.

<img alt="Mourners stand at a memorial altar for victims of the Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785453_2_20241230120403.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused deadliest air disaster in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were killed when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled out alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority for now is identifying the victims, supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi told a disaster management meeting in Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As soon as the accident recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport ministry said authorities were considering whether to conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by South Korean airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was trying to land shortly after 9am on Sunday at the airport in the southwest of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the crash, fire officials have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts say many questions remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway and into a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  CFM International is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France's Safran.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled approach they told air traffic control the aircraft had suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots then declared mayday and signalled their intention to go around shortly before the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing and crashed into a structure at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are investigating what role the wall at the end of the runway played in the crash, including the embankment on which it was standing, transport ministry officials told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed mostly local residents who were returning from holidays in Thailand, while two Thai nationals also died.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify some of the last remaining victims, as anguished families waited inside the Muan airport terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash, said he was told by authorities that his brother had been identified but has not been able to see his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park called on other victims' families to unite in responding to the disaster and recovery efforts, citing a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. Prolonged efforts to identify the victims and cause of the sinking followed that disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers were sifting through wreckage that was nearly completely destroyed when the aircraft was engulfed in an explosion of flames and debris at the regional airport near the country's winding western coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transportation ministry officials said the jet's flight data recorder was recovered but appeared to have sustained some damage on the outside and it was not yet clear whether the data was sufficiently intact to be analysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Muan airport remains closed through Wednesday but the rest of the country's international and regional airports including the main Incheon International Airport near Seoul were operating as scheduled. (Reuters)

    Investigators seek arrest warrant for President Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing South Korea's Yoon Suk-yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Monday said they sought an arrest warrant for the suspended president after he failed to report for questioning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader also faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A former prosecutor himself, Yoon had been summoned three times by investigators for questioning, but refused to present himself each time -- including by yesterday's deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters filed an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk-yeol with the Seoul Western District Court", said the probe team in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The application by investigators marks the first attempt in the country's history to forcibly detain a president before the impeachment procedure is complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated by prosecutors as well as a joint team comprising police, defence ministry, and anti-corruption officials. (AFP)

    Haliburton leads Pacers over Celtics; Magic hang on

<img alt="Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton drives the ball against Celtics' Al Horford. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785444_1_20241230110111.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points as the Pacers turned the tables on the NBA champion Celtics with a confident 123-114 victory in Boston.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after Jaylen Brown's 44 points propelled the Celtics to a 142-105 blowout victory over the Pacers, Indiana got their revenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haliburton added six rebounds and seven assists without a turnover and six players scored in double figures for Indiana, whose lights-out shooting in the second quarter saw them seize a seven-point halftime lead that they would push to as many as 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown stayed hot, delivering 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting with six assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each for Indiana, with Nembhard adding eight rebounds and eight assists as he returned after missing Friday's game with left knee tendinitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nembhard said maintaining their pace in the fourth quarter – when Boston cut an 11-point deficit to two with seven and a half minutes to play, was key for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that was the biggest thing we did late in the game," he said. "We kept pace in the game. We didn't slow it down and worry about the score too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Orlando, Cole Anthony drove for the game-winning layup as the Magic erased a 21-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Tristan da Silva scored 21 points to lead the injury-ravaged Magic. Goga Bitadze added 19 and Anthony scored five of his 10 in the fourth quarter, as Orlando closed the game on a 22-4 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas, back after missing 13 games with a hamstring strain, came off the bench and led Brooklyn's scoring with 25 points but missed a jump shot as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony admitted that da Silva, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, was supposed to get the ball on the play that yielded his game winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When that failed to pan out, he said, "I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go get a layup".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nets were without veteran Dorian Finney-Smith, who was traded along with Shake Milton to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a deal that sent D'Angelo Russell back to Brooklyn. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter "lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds," President Joe Biden said on Sunday in televised remarks addressing the death of the former US leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden's tribute, like many that came in from US and global leaders, focused on Carter's character, with the outgoing president describing his predecessor as seeming to be from a "bygone era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just look at his life, his life's work," Biden said, speaking from the US Virgin Islands, where he was on vacation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing for the homeless with his own hands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also declared January 9 a national day of mourning for Carter, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship to "pay homage" to the late US leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr," Biden said in a White House proclamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the former US presidents, Bill Clinton said his predecessor had "worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."
  <br>
  <br>
  George W. Bush said Carter "dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn't end with the presidency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Barack Obama hailed Carter for teaching "all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer paid tribute to Jimmy Carter for his "lifelong dedication to peace" and said the former US president had "redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Jimmy Carter served as US president when Ukraine was not yet independent but "his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply appreciate his steadfast commitment to Christian faith and democratic values, as well as his unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cuba, the island's leader Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Sunday his nation would remember Carter "with gratitude".
  <br>
  <br>
  During his presidency, Carter made moves to normalise diplomatic ties and relax US sanctions on the country, and "our people will remember with gratitude his efforts to improve relations," Diaz-Canel said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Panama's President Jose Mulino said negotiations with Carter "achieved the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands and the full sovereignty of our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in January, has threatened to demand the key waterway be returned to the United States, which originally completed and operated it. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East division title after handing the Dallas Cowboys a humiliating 41-7 defeat, while the Buffalo Bills secured the second seed in the AFC with a 40-14 crushing of the New York Jets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cowboys were already eliminated from playoff contention and without top receiver CeeDee Lamb with a shoulder injury, but it was their defence that struggled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles starting quarter-back Jalen Hurts missed the game due to concussion. Kenny Pickett got the start but had to leave the game in the third quarter with a rib injury with Philadelphia 24-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant third-choice Tanner McKee took over under the centre and two of his four passes were for touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real damage to the Cowboys, who gave up four turnovers, was done by the Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley who put up 167 yards on 31 carries to pass the 2,000 yard mark for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, who has 2,005 yards needs to put up 101 yards next week to break Eric Dickerson's record for the most rushing yards in a season, set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it," Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means the Eagles are guaranteed at least the number two seed in the NFC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bills took the second seed in the AFC behind defending champions Kansas City Chiefs, after taking care of business against the New York Jets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills led 12-0 at the half before their quarterback Josh Allen took total control of the game with touchdown passes to Amari Cooper and Keon Coleman either side of a rushing score from James Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who threw for 182 yards, had opened the scoring with a one-yard rush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw two interceptions and was sacked four times.

  “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying," he added. "But it had no effect on us.” (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as US president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday, the Carter Center said. He was 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  “My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter, the former president’s son. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Democrat, he served as president from January 1977 to January 1981 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 US election. Carter was swept from office four years later in an electoral landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lived longer after his term in office than any other US president. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was dogged by an economy in recession, persistent unpopularity and the embarrassment of the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his "untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th US president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jimmy Carter and I'm running for president. I will never lie to you," Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: "The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East was the focus of Carter's foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unravelling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter's presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a US hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight US soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on January 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the US Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full US ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter created two new US Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America's "energy crisis" was "the moral equivalent of war" and urged the country to embrace conservation. "Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth," he told Americans in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his "malaise" speech to the nation, although he never used that word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America," he said in his televised address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America."
  <br>
  <br>
  As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behaviour of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: "I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan dismissively told Carter, "There you go again," when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan's views during one debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.
  <br>
  <br>
  He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called "the most important thing in my life." They had three sons and a daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia's governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration," despite decades of just such domination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter's 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not all of Carter's post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter's freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most "gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made." He called George W. Bush's administration "the worst in history" and said Vice President Dick Cheney was "a disaster for our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump's legitimacy as president, saying "he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf." Trump responded by calling Carter "a terrible president."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant's spent fuel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration by announcing the deal with North Korea's leader without first checking with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children's book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book "Faith: A Journey for All," was published in 2018. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rampant Liverpool smashed West Ham 5-0 on Sunday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points as Manchester City returned to winning ways at troubled Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to second in the table with a fifth straight win at Everton, while Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham conceded late to draw 2-2 against Vitor Pereira's rejuvenated Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's Liverpool look unstoppable in their quest for a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title, recording their 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz opened the scoring against Julen Lopetegui's hapless team on the half-hour, before Mohamed Salah set up Cody Gakpo for the second with some audacious footwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egypt international then scored his 20th goal of the season shortly before half-time to put the visitors in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 4-0 with a deflected shot from distance in the 54th minute and Diogo Jota completed the rout, courtesy of another Salah assist following a surging run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy," said Slot, flying in his first season in the Anfield hotseat after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's striking success has come against the background of mounting speculation over the futures of Salah, Alexander-Arnold and captain Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three can discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer from January 1 but remain focused on winning a second Premier League title together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only thing on my mind is I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of that," Salah told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best for the team to win the trophy. There are a few other teams catching up with us and we need to stay focused and humble."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, defending champions City travelled to relegation-threatened Leicester drained of confidence after just one win in all competitions since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their frailties over the past two months, which resulted in nine defeats in their previous 13 games, were on display again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Savinho's first-half goal and an Erling Haaland header after the break made it 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's bid for a fifth straight title looks to be over as they are 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result lifts them to fifth in the table and within striking distance of fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our mood is in a better position. It was tight in the second half, they were much better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the new year can help us bounce back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest beat Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park, leapfrogging Chelsea and Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood chipped over Jordan Pickford for the opening goal in the 15th minute after being set up by Anthony Elanga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wood turned provider for Forest's second, which came just after the hour mark when Morgan Gibbs-White produced some neat footwork before firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Spurs were on track to end a torrid December on a high after first-half goals by Rodrigo Bentancur and Brennan Johnson cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan's brilliant opener for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham captain Son Heung-min also squandered a 43rd-minute penalty, but it did not appear to be too costly until substitute Jorgen Strand Larsen smashed home in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the person in charge, so of course it hurts," said Postecoglou, whose team have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I see how hard they are trying, it hurts even more because you want them to get a reward and I think today they deserved a reward for their efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace won just their second home league game of the season, seeing off bottom club Southampton 2-1, thanks to goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Eberechi Eze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara scored an 89th-minute leveller as Bournemouth drew 2-2 at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea and Manchester United are in action on Monday, with Arsenal travelling to Brentford on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Ahmed al-Sharaa is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that led the coalition that seized power in Damascus. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785401_1_20241230042017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told Al Arabiya on Sunday that elections could take four years, noting the importance of ties with Iran and Russia and calling for the United States to lift sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The election process could take four years," Sharaa told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television, three weeks after his Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebels ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to rewrite the constitution" which could take "two or three years", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wide-ranging interview, he expressed hope that the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on his now war-torn and impoverished country under Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sanctions on Syria were issued based on the crimes that the regime committed," Sharaa said, adding that since Assad was gone, "these sanctions should be removed automatically".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many governments including the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader also noted the importance of ties with Russia and Iran, which were both key allies of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran, but they must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and non-interference in the affairs of both countries," Sharaa said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia is an important country and is considered the second most powerful country in the world," he said, noting the "deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said local Kurdish-led forces which Turkey opposes would be integrated into the national army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Weapons must be in the hands of the state alone. Whoever is armed and qualified to join the defence ministry, we will welcome them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on these criteria, "we will open a negotiations dialogue with the SDF, to perhaps find an appropriate solution," referring to the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's north and northeast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two drug trafficking cases will be brought up at West Kowloon Magistrates Courts on Monday, after 30 kilos of suspected ketamine - with a street value of HK$14 million - was seized at Hong Kong International Airport on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first case involves a man, aged 25 who had flown in from Frankfurt, and a 24-year woman who was arrested later at Hong Kong International Airport. The second involves a 47-year-old woman who had flown from Frankfurt, via Taipei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said all three suspects were locals.

 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, in an emergency meeting on Sunday evening, declared a national mourning period until January 4 over the plane crash at Muan International Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jeju Air passenger plane skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames after its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people on board died in one of the country’s worst aviation disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that had arrived in the South Korean city from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 179 people - 85 women, 84 men and 10 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable - died in the fire, the South Korean fire agency said. Emergency workers pulled two people, both flight attendants, to safety. Health officials said they are conscious and not in life-threatening condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A transport official said both black boxes - the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - have been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he felt “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular checkups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.

  <br>
  Family members wailed as officials announced the names of some victims at a lounge in the Muan airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.
