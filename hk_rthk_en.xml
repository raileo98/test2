<img alt="Lo Chung-mau says the new fee of up to HK$400 for A&E treatments in public hospitals is reasonable. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797455_1_20250326115900.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health says the new fee for people seeking help at accident and emergency wards in public hospitals can result in quicker treatment for more serious cases.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting January 1 next year, non-critical and non-emergency patients will have to pay HK$400 per visit, up from the present flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, Lo Chung-mau pointed out that the new fee is reasonable, saying that charges for similar services in other places can exceed US$1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that category four and five patients, or those deemed as "semi-urgent" and "non-urgent" respectively, now account for 60 percent of the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said this has led to urgent patients – or category three cases – not getting treated in time sometimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have not met the target of treating 90 percent of [category three] patients within 30 minutes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only managed to treat about 70 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we think we should be able to improve on that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through the fee adjustments, we hope to help more category three patients and meet our service targets, allowing them to be treated sooner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the government has taken into account public affordability, how to better utilise services, as well as cost sharing when coming up with the adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo emphasised that while evening outpatient services have been stepped up, patients will not opt for private clinics if A&E fees remain at a low level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko pointed out that the decision not to exempt category three A&E patients from the fee rise helps to avoid unnecessary arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have talked to a lot of colleagues, especially those from A&E," he told a Commercial Radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of triage, it's very clear for category one and two patients because we will look at their vital signs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But sometimes, when it comes to category three and four, it's not that easy to differentiate between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of the time, it's clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But to avoid unnecessary argument and taking into consideration day-to-day operations, we think that the charge of HK$400 is suitable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the revamp, each drug prescription will be up to a maximum of four weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drugs will cost HK$20 per four-week supply at specialist outpatient clinics and HK$5 at general outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko pointed out that patients can still be dispersed a maximum of 24 weeks drug supply each time, depending on the doctor's prescription.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added public education will be stepped up to ensure that people are aware of the adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 18 people have been killed in one of South Korea's worst wildfire outbreaks, with multiple blazes burning and causing "unprecedented damage," acting president Han Duck-soo said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen different blazes broke out over the weekend, with the death toll jumping overnight as one major fire tore through villages and burned a historical temple to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has raised the crisis alert to its highest level and declared a "a full-scale national response" to bring the fires under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eighteen people died in the wildfires," a ministry of safety official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additionally, six people were seriously injured and 13 suffered minor injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dry, windy weather has hampered efforts to contain the fires, with the government taking the rare step of evacuating thousands of prisoners out of detention centres in affected counties.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, authorities issued an emergency alert for Hahoe Folk Village – a Unesco-listed world heritage site popular with tourists – as the blaze drew closer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wildfires burning for a fifth-consecutive day in Ulsan and the Gyeongsang region are causing unprecedented damage," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told an emergency safety and disaster meeting that the blazes were "developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched emergency evacuations on Tuesday afternoon "but sadly, casualties could not be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night, chaos continued as power and communication lines were cut in several areas and roads were blocked," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of firefighters have been deployed, but "strong winds reaching speeds of 25 metres per second persisted from yesterday afternoon through the night, forcing the suspension of helicopter and drone operations," Han said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constantly shifting wind directions and ongoing dry weather advisories have revealed the limitations of conventional firefighting methods," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han said the government has launched a "full-scale national response".
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuees sheltering in the gym of Sinsung elementary school said the fire had hit their villages so quickly they did not have time to take anything with them as they fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The wind was so strong," Kwon So-han, a 79-year-old resident in Andong said, adding that as soon as he got the evacuation order he fled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire came from the mountain and fell on my house," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who haven't experienced it won't know. I could only bring my body."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain is forecast for late Wednesday, with authorities hoping to capitalise on even a light sprinkling to help extinguish the fires. (AFP)

    Son homes in on pitches for S Korea's World Cup slips

<img alt="Son Heung-min reacts at the end of the match with Jordan that saw South Korea draw again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797449_1_20250326114106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Son Heung-min blamed South Korea's shoddy pitches for their 2026 World Cup qualifying struggles after a 1-1 draw with Jordan left them sweating on an automatic place at the tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Koreans were held at home for a second game in a row on Tuesday after also drawing with Oman last week and hold a precarious lead at the top of Asian qualifying Group B with an away trip to third-placed Iraq still to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's two qualifiers in March were moved away from Seoul because of the capital stadium's poor pitch but skipper Son said the turf was still below par and took aim at his country's football administrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we're at home we're supposed to enjoy the best playing conditions possible but things have not improved at all," the Tottenham striker told reporters after the game in Suwon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know we can play better than this but when conditions on our home soil get in the way, then I wonder where we should get our home advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Poor pitches have been a running theme in South Korean football, with former Manchester United and England forward Jesse Lingard also weighing in last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lingard, who now plays for FC Seoul in the K League, tripped over a chunk of turf while playing at home for his club and later took to social media to air his frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's World Cup qualifier against Iraq in October last year was also moved away from the capital because of the playing conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know this may sound like an excuse, but every small detail matters in football," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can make the difference of getting one point or getting three points. I hope people will pay closer attention to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-sung gave South Korea the lead in the fifth minute before Jordan equalised later in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves the Koreans on top of Group B with 16 points, three ahead of Jordan and four ahead of Iraq, who suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Palestine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two qualify automatically for the World Cup in 2026 in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea play Iraq away in their next game before rounding off their campaign at home to Kuwait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite this disappointment we're still leading the group and that's a fact," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to stay there until the end of the round."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Indonesia head coach Patrick Kluivert said it was "just the beginning" after his Indonesia side beat Bahrain 1-0 in front of nearly 70,000 in Jakarta to breathe new life into their World Cup qualifying hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five days after Barcelona and Dutch great Kluivert saw his team thrashed 5-1 by Australia in his first game as coach, Oxford United's Ole Romeny scored the only goal in the 24th minute for a vital three points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan top Asian qualifying Group C and have already punched their ticket to North America in 2026, with Australia in distant second in the other automatic qualifying place on 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  With two rounds of matches to go, Saudi Arabia are third on 10 points, one point ahead of Indonesia in fourth, with Bahrain and China on six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing third and fourth go into another round of qualifying – Indonesia's most likely route to their first World Cup since gaining independence as a country in 1945. (AFP)

    Sabalenka sets up Paolini semis with win over Zheng

<img alt="Aryna Sabalenka has a word with Zheng Qinwen after their Miami Open match at the Hard Rock Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797443_1_20250326112222.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka battled back in the second set to blast her way into the semi-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 7-5 win over China's Zheng Qinwen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory  on Tuesday gives Sabalenka her first place in the last four at Miami, with a clash against Italy's Jasmine Paolini standing between her and a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It looked like it was going to be routine business for the Belarussian against the ninth-seed Zheng when Sabalenka took the first set comfortably.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng had worked something out between sets and came out firing, breaking Sabalenka twice to open up a 4-2 lead in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was in real trouble at 0-40 down but, after some signs of anger, was able to fight back to hold for 4-4 and then turned her aggression into a powerful finale.
  <br>
  <br>
  With some blistering returns, the top-seed broke to go 6-5 and then with her serve at full force, confidently held to secure the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Paolini moved into the semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, beaten in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to make it to the last four in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took just 77 minutes for Paolini to take care of business against Linette who had progressed into the quarters with a surprise win over Coco Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy delay to the start of the game, caused by heavy rain in the afternoon, didn't cause any issues for the sixth-seeded Paolini who dominated from the off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, who is looking for her second title at the WTA 1000 level, after last year's triumph in Dubai, looked confident and said she had known her form would start to bring her results.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there – maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's two quarters see second-seed Iga Swiatek up against Alexandra Eala, the wild-card teenager from the Philippines, who has already beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

<img alt="The Hospital Authority said it would not resume the use of the light in question until thorough checks are completed. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797428_1_20250326094629.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has suspended the use of about 200 examination lights of the same model as that involved in a recent incident that saw a surgical lamp fall at Hong Kong Adventist Hospital in Tsuen Wan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The authority said late on Tuesday that it has been notified of the incident, which saw the lamp hit a doctor and a healthcare staff while a patient was under examination, by the Department of Health and the manufacturer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a precautionary measure, the Hospital Authority has immediately halted the use of all ceiling-mounted examination lights of the relevant model," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temporary replacements from other manufacturers or using different models have been carried out to ensure that clinical services remain unaffected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority urged the manufacturer to complete thorough inspections as soon as possible and to guarantee the safety of the examination lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until then, it said, hospitals and clinics will not use the model.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stressed that all ceiling-mounted medical equipment in hospitals and clinics undergo regular maintenance and servicing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will closely monitor the manufacturer to ensure proper inspection, maintenance and servicing of medical equipment, safeguarding the safety of both patients and staff.

 Novak Djokovic cruised into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Italian Lorenzo Musetti in one hour 22 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musetti, the 15th seed from Tuscany, got off to a flying start to take a 2-0 lead in the first set but then proceeded to lose the next nine games as the Serb, looking confident and sharp, ran away with the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic has won the Miami Open on six occasions but has not featured in the quarters since his last victory here in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old is now just three wins away from winning his 100th tour-level title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had a really good start of the match. First couple games I started a little bit slow and then I knew that if I give him time, he's going to make his shots," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He loves kind of running around his backhand, hitting forehands. But he is so talented, he can play any shot in the game on any surface," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, particularly in the first seven, eight games of the match. But I think breaking his serve to come back to two-all and break right away at 3-2, it was a momentum shift and I tried to use that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will face American Sebastian Korda on Wednesday for a place in the semi-finals after the 24th seed beat French veteran Gael Monfils 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in a rain-affected match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda visibly struggled with his wrist, however, and said after the match that he had been in discomfort with an injury that has caused him trouble in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty painful right now, we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Will do a lot of work with my physio now, we'll see how it is tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't played a lot of tournaments this year. Hopefully I can play some good tennis and see where it takes me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda later pulled out of his doubles match with partner Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo upset fifth-seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-2 to take his place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, who enjoys plenty of support from South Florida's large Argentine community, has now reached the last eight in three of his past four appearances at Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo failed to make the most of three break points in the opening game but eventually broke through at 3-3, converting his fourth break point of that game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23rd seed, who lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, was dominant in the second set, but his victory was postponed by a three-hour, 30-minute rain delay that arrived when he was 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy. It's always difficult when you're playing a really good match, controlling the game, and you have to stop for rain," said Cerundolo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy, but I was chill and came back to the match confident and played a really good service game. I'm super happy to get back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals in the US, on hard courts. It's a great achievement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Cerundolo is 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated American Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day after a thrilling three-set win over Brazilian Joao Fonseca, Australia's Alex de Minaur was eliminated by tenth-seed Italian Matteo Berrettini who triumphed 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini had the chance to close out the match when serving at 6-5 but let three match points slip and the match went into a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur then had a great chance to force a deciding set when he was 6-3 up but was unable to convert the three set points and Berrettini was able to claw back victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian will face third-seed Taylor Fritz who progressed with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Australia lucky loser Adam Walton. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A months-long investigation into the mysterious death of a French toddler took a surprise turn on Tuesday when police arrested four people including the boy's grandparents on suspicion of murder and concealment of a body.
 <br>
  <br>
  The death of Emile Soleil, a boy of two-and-a-half who went missing in a French Alpine village in July 2023, had remained unexplained even after some of his remains were discovered nine months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors at the time said the cause of his death could have been "a fall, manslaughter or murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile had been staying at the summer home of his maternal grandparents in the tiny hamlet of Le Haut-Vernet when he vanished. Emile's mother and father were absent on the day he disappeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a sharp turn of events on Tuesday, the boy's 59-year-old grandfather, Philippe Vedovini, and his wife were arrested on suspicion of voluntary homicide and concealment of a corpse, said Aix-en-Provence public prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two adult children of the couple were also arrested, Blachon added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's arrests were the result of fact-finding "over recent months", the prosecutor told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month investigators had returned to the village, sparking talk of a development in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large flowerpot with traces of blood had been seized by the investigators in front of a local church, a source close to the case told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several years ago the boy's grandfather had been questioned over alleged violence and sexual assault at a private school in the 1990s where he was a scout leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had initially considered his possible involvement in Emile's death as only one of many hypotheses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps what is happening is not what we had expected," said Philippe Vedovini's lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, when questioned by police in Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that "being placed in police custody means nothing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Julien Pinelli, who represents Emile's grandmother, Anne Vedovini, said that she wanted nothing more than to learn "the truth about this tragedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if this measure is necessary to find the truth, of course she will submit to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern village of La Bouilladisse, an AFP reporter saw police conduct a search of the couple's main home, an affluent farmhouse. They have seized an SUV and a horse trailer.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the neighbours, who did not wish to give his name, saw the police detain Vedovini, who is an osteopath, and his wife at 7 am in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, they're quiet neighbours," he said. "They've been under pressure for the past two years, that's for sure. They have lived in a reclusive manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile was last seen walking alone on a street in Le Vernet, 1,200 metres (4,000 feet) up in the French Alps, in the late afternoon of July 8, 2023. He was wearing a yellow T-shirt, white shorts and tiny hiking shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A massive search failed to find any sign of the boy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nine months later, a walker discovered his skull and teeth 1.7 kilometres from the village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later found more bones and items of the boy's clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, a traditional Catholic funeral mass for the toddler was held in the Basilica of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine, a Unesco-listed medieval Gothic cathedral said to house relics of Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus Christ.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hundred mourners were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile's grandparents and parents are devout Catholics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within hours of the ceremony, the grandparents published a statement saying "the period of silence must yield to the period of truth."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to understand. We need to know," they said. (AFP)

<img alt="Brazil's midfielder Joao Gomes walks off the pitch downcast as Argentina's players celebrate their win over Brazil at the Mas Monumental stadium in Buenos Aires. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797405_2_20250326110003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina celebrated their 2026 World Cup qualification with a dazzling 4-1 thrashing of arch-rivals Brazil in Buenos Aires.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julian Alvarez, Enzo Fernandez, Alexis Mac Allister and Giuliano Simeone sealed an emphatic win on Tuesday for the world champions, who had been assured of their World Cup berth after Bolivia's 0-0 draw with Uruguay earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That goalless stalemate ensured a festive atmosphere at the Estadio Monumental before a ball had been kicked and Argentina kept the party going with a blistering performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico Madrid forward Alvarez opened the scoring after just six minutes, latching onto Thiago Almada's through ball and dinking a close-range finish past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  It got better for Argentina six minutes later when Chelsea's Fernandez tucked away the hosts' second goal of the night after Brazil's back four failed to deal with a low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Brazil being run ragged by a rampant Argentina, they were thrown a lifeline on 26 minutes after a blunder by Cristian Romero gifted a goal to Mattheus Cunha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Romero was caught in possession 25 yards from goal, allowing Cunha to steal in and drive a low shot past Emiliano Martinez to make it 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any hopes of a Brazilian fightback were snuffed out in the 37th minute with a superb goal from Mac Allister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almada was once again the creator, lofting a pass into the area which Mac Allister met with a first-time volley to make it 3-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Argentina in complete control, Simeone then brought the house down with a 71st minute strike to make it 4-1 – his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone, the 22-year-old son of Argentine legend Diego Simeone, somehow blasted into the roof of the net from an acute angle to crown a dominant performance by the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means Argentina have qualified for next year's finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada with four games to spare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentines lead the 10-team qualifying group with 31 points from 14 games and are guaranteed one of the six automatic qualifying slots awarded to South America. Brazil are fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American games, Ecuador stayed on course for qualification with a 0-0 draw against Chile in Santiago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador are second in the standings, eight points adrift of Argentina on 23 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uruguay's draw with Bolivia – and Brazil's heavy loss – allowed them to move up to third place on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia meanwhile missed the chance to close the gap on the leaders after a 2-2 home draw with Paraguay in Barranquilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Luis Diaz and Jhon Duran fired Colombia into a 2-0 lead after just 13 minutes but Paraguay grabbed a share of the points with goals from Junior Alonso and Julio Enciso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela boosted their hopes of a first-ever World Cup qualification with a 1-0 win over Peru in Maturin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salomon Rondon's 41st-minute penalty secured three precious points for Venezuela, who are the only South American team never to have qualified for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela's win lifted them into seventh place in the table, leaving them on course for an inter-confederation playoff. (AFP)

    Deals reached on Ukraine maritime and energy truce

<img alt="Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov talks to reporters after US-Russia talks on a Ukraine ceasefire. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797401_1_20250326063126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States reached deals on Tuesday with Ukraine and Russia to pause attacks at sea and against energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some sanctions against Moscow in its latest step towards endorsing Russia's positions.
 <br>
  <br>
  The separate agreements are the first formal commitments by the warring sides since the inauguration of Donald Trump, who is pushing for an end to the war and a rapid rapprochement with Moscow that has alarmed Kyiv and European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US agreement with Russia goes further than the agreement with Ukraine, with Washington committing to help seek the lifting of international sanctions on Russian agriculture and fertiliser exports, long a persistent Russian demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the Black Sea agreements would not come into effect unless links between some Russian banks and the international financial system were restored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this was untrue, and there was no requirement of sanctions relief for the deals to come into force.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, even now, even today, on the very day of negotiations, we see how the Russians have already begun to manipulate," Zelensky said in his nightly video address. "They are already trying to distort agreements and, in fact, deceive both our intermediaries and the entire world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv and Moscow both said they would rely on Washington to enforce the deals, while expressing scepticism that the other side would abide by them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: "We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelensky and his team to do one thing and not the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said the truce agreements would take effect immediately, and that if Russia violated them he would ask Trump to impose additional sanctions on Moscow and provide more weapons for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no faith in the Russians, but we will be constructive," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deals were reached after parallel talks in Saudi Arabia that followed separate phone calls last week between Trump and the two presidents, Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin rejected Trump's proposal for a full ceasefire lasting 30 days, which Ukraine had previously endorsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has nevertheless softened its rhetoric towards Russia in recent days, with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff saying he did not "regard Putin as a bad guy", alarming European officials who consider the Russian leader a dangerous enemy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said Kyiv would regard any movement of Russian military vessels outside the eastern part of the Black Sea as a violation and a threat, in which case Ukraine would have the full right to self-defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has attacked Ukraine's power grid with missiles and drones throughout the war, arguing that civil energy infrastructure is a legitimate target because it helps Ukraine's warfighting capability.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, Ukraine has been launching long-range strikes on Russian oil and gas targets, which it says provide fuel for Russia's troops and income to fund its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said the pause in attacks on energy would last for 30 days from March 18, when Putin first discussed it with Trump. Ukraine had said last week that it would accept such a pause only after a formal agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement on a truce at sea addresses an issue that was critical early in the war, when Russia imposed a de facto naval blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, worsening a global food crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  More recently, maritime battles have been only a comparatively small part of the war since Russia withdrew its naval forces from the eastern Black Sea after a number of successful Ukrainian attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has been able to reopen its ports and resume exports at around pre-war levels, despite the collapse of a previous UN-brokered Black Sea shipping agreement, but its ports have come under regular air attack. Zelensky said the agreement would bar such strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said the agreement would require sanctions relief including restoring links between Russia's agricultural export bank and the Swift international payments system. That and other steps could require agreement from European countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been pressing Moscow and Kyiv to bring a rapid end to the war, a goal he promised to achieve when he ran for president last year. At the same time he is pursuing a rapid rapprochement with Russia that Washington and Moscow say could lead to lucrative business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine and its European allies fear Trump could strike a hasty deal with Putin that undermines their security and caves in to Russian demands, including for Kyiv to abandon its Nato ambitions and give up land claimed by Moscow. (Reuters)

    US stocks make minor gains on tariff hopes

<img alt="Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797399_1_20250326062321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly closed higher on Tuesday, building on earlier gains amid hopes that US President Donald Trump might take a narrower approach to upcoming tariffs than originally expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 42,587.50, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 5,776.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.5 percent to 18,271.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The absence of bad news is good news for stocks," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there has been "so much bad news" over the last few weeks that the respite on Tuesday allowed investors to breathe a sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, markets are waiting for further hints about Trump's upcoming tariff rollout, with the president having promised "reciprocal tariffs" tailored to each trading partner on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump earlier signaled that sector-specific levies hitting industries like automobiles and semiconductors could come around the same day, the White House said Monday that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March, the Conference Board said, with survey respondents flagging growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, new US home sales picked up slightly less than expected last month, with analysts warning that tariffs could raise costs for homebuilders -- weighing on the market subsequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting updates on US GDP data released Thursday, and the release of a key inflation gauge due Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics said on Tuesday it had approved the introduction of a cheek swab test to determine if an athlete is biologically female.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sebastian Coe, the president of the international track and field federation, said the test, whose introduction was given the green light by the World Athletics Council, was a "really important" way of protecting the female category.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it," Coe said in a press conference after the Council met over two days in Nanjing, China following the World Indoor Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics has not fixed a date for the introduction of the test, but it is expected to be in place for the outdoor World Championships in Tokyo this September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe said the decision to introduce the swab testing was taken after a wide consultation on the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overwhelmingly, the view has come back that this is absolutely the way to go," Coe said, adding that the swab test was not considered to be overly intrusive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was confident that the policy could stand up to legal challenge, but added: "You accept the fact that that is the world we live in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would never have set off down this path to protect the female category in sport if I'd been anything other than prepared to take the challenge head on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (difference of sex development) regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we'll do whatever is necessary to do it. And we're not just talking about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics is looking at cheek swab tests but is also considering using blood spot tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test for the SRY gene, which is "almost always on the male Y chromosome" and "is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex", would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career, the federation says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe warned during his campaign to be elected International Olympic Committee president "that we run the risk of losing women's sport" unless the female category was protected. (AFP)

<img alt="Gerard Depardieu, 76, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797392_1_20250326035129.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 French star actor Gerard Depardieu, on trial for sexual assault, told the Paris court on Tuesday that he was not in the habit of "groping" women, and called the #MeToo movement a "reign of terror".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I don't see why I would go around groping a woman, her buttocks, her breasts," Depardieu said in his first statement at the trial, in which he is charged with sexual assault on two women during the shooting of a film in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not somebody who rubs himself against others on the metro," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu said he was "not like that" in response to the accusations, adding that "there are vices that are alien to me".
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu, 76, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, has been accused of improper behaviour by around 20 women but this is the first case to come to trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I deny all of it," the actor, dressed in black, said in the packed courtroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement, which he told the court on Tuesday "will become a reign of terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial relates to charges of sexual assault during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" ("The Green Shutters") by director Jean Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anouk Grinberg, a prominent actor who appeared in the film, has backed the two plaintiffs – a set dresser, 54, identified only as Amelie, and a 34-year-old assistant director. Both women allege sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another prominent actor Fanny Ardant is expected to testify in favour of Depardieu later this week. (AFP)

    Trump, intel chiefs dismiss chat breach

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump and his top intelligence officials raced on Tuesday to stem a growing scandal after a journalist was accidentally added to a group chat about air strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels in a security breach.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump brushed off the leak as a "glitch," while the CIA director and the White House intelligence chief both claimed during a Senate hearing that no classified information was divulged in the conversation on the Signal messaging app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also defended his National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who added Atlantic's magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat by mistake ahead of the air strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told broadcaster NBC that the breach was "the only glitch in two months, and it turned out not to be a serious one". Waltz "has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe – who were both reported to be in the chat – both endured a stormy Senate Intelligence Committee hearing over the leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no classified material that was shared," Gabbard, who has previously caused controversy with comments sympathetic to Russia and Syria, told the committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She refused however to comment on whether Signal had been installed on her personal phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ratcliffe confirmed he was involved in the Signal group and had the app installed on his work computer, but said the communications were "entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information".
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats on the committee called on Waltz and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senator Mark Warner blasted what he called "sloppy, careless, incompetent behaviour". (AFP)

<img alt="The goalless draw ended the SAR's record seven-match winning run. Image courtesy of Hong Kong Football Association" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797379_2_20250326053556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China and hosts Singapore battled to a goalless draw on Tuesday night as they began the final round of their AFC Asian Cup football qualifying campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  This extended Hong Kong’s unbeaten run against Singapore to seven games, of which the SAR had secured victories on three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was the hosts who dominated the first half, forcing the SAR squad to sub out attacking midfielder Wong Wai for defender Yue Tze-nam in the 34th minute to withstand the pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad had a much better performance after the break, building a more structured offence, but could not catch a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts had two goals disallowed, including a lovely chip shot by Shawal Anuar in the 77th minute that was ruled offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be back to play at Kai Tak Sports Park on June 10 against India for their next qualifying match.
  <br>
  <br>
  To earn a spot in the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia, the SAR will need to come out on top of Group C, which also features Bangladesh.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of directly qualifying for the 2026 World Cup took a hit after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Australia on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jackson Irvine scored a brilliant curling shot to open the scoring for the Aussies in the 16th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  An error by China’s goalkeeper Wang Dalei shocked the home crowds at Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium 13 minutes later, as he let a weak shot by Nishan Velupillay slip through his fingers.
  <br>
  <br>
  China made four changes after the break and threw bodies forward in search of a goal but those efforts were in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the loss, the national team stayed at the bottom of the group of six, seven points behind second place Australia with two matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two teams of the group directly qualify for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  China now need to fight for a fourth-place finish in the group to advance to the fourth qualifying round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their two remaining group matches are against Indonesia and Bahrain.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coleman Wong’s history-making performance at the Miami Open will serve as a huge morale boost for the SAR’s next generation of tennis players, Hong Kong, China’s tennis chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old became the first-ever player from the SAR to get a win at a Masters 1000 match, and reached the event’s round of 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Cheng, president of Hong Kong China Tennis Association, said it was a remarkable achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The draw size of a 1000 event is actually 96, which means that we're putting him inside the top 100 players in the world and he is able to get through a couple of rounds,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He's done something which no one has done before in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The city’s tennis boss said Wong’s groundbreaking result would inspire a lot of young players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we're looking at in the tennis generation here overall is to make sure that one generation is better than the last one,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, tennis has retained its "Tier A" sport status for two more years, avoiding a significant funding cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the decision is vital to the development of the sport in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not just about the funding, but it's also about the coaching and the technical support and the strength and conditioning support and the sports science support coming from the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you put it all together, it's the complete package,” he said.

<img alt="Experts say family doctors should educate patients about whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797359_1_20250325203807.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A family physician said on Tuesday that the government's overhaul of healthcare charges could motivate people to prioritise their overall health instead of only focusing on treating a disease.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Ho-lim, vice president of general affairs at the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians, said it is important for family doctors to educate patients about urgent and non-urgent symptoms so they could decide whether a visit to the accident and emergency unit is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we promote health – and with a healthy lifestyle and with a very good management of chronic diseases – a lot of complications and a lot of acute conditions can be prevented," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In turn, it will reduce the attendance to specialist operations departments or the A&E department."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Lau pointed out that the cost of advanced pathology and non-urgent imaging tests in the public sector remain significantly lower than those in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Head of healthcare and social innovation at Our Hong Kong Foundation, Dicky Chow, welcomed the government's review of the public healthcare fee structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow believes it will enhance the healthcare system’s sustainability and ensure that public funds are used more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chow urged the government to enhance the capacity of outpatient and primary care services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also suggested that authorities should establish more evening clinics and better utilise community pharmacies to help meet demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) expressed the concern that the proposed fee adjustments could add significant financial burden to grassroots and lower-middle class patients with chronic illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They emphasised the need for a more comprehensive medical fee waiver system to prevent these groups from missing out on necessary treatments due to financial constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested that the government should clarify how increased fees would enhance public healthcare services.

<img alt="Vietnamese property tycoon Truong My Lan (centre) looks on at a court in Ho Chi Minh City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797356_1_20250325193707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The appeal of a Vietnamese property tycoon convicted of money laundering began on Tuesday, three months after she lost a challenge against the death penalty in a separate case.
 <br>
  <br>
  Property developer Truong My Lan was found guilty in April 2024 of stealing money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) and sentenced to death for fraud amounting to US$27 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan appealed against that verdict and the court said there was no basis to reduce her sentence, but ruled that she could still escape the death penalty if she returned three quarters of the stolen assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now she is appealing against the verdict from a second trial in October, in which she was sentenced to life in prison for three crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday Lan, now accustomed to high-profile hearings, chatted with police officers and looked relatively relaxed as she waited for the court to start in Ho Chi Minh City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her niece, who was handed a five-year prison term in October for fraudulent appropriation of property, sat behind her, flanked by officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 68-year-old was found guilty of laundering US$17.7 billion and illegal cross-border trafficking of US$4.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also found guilty of bond fraud to the tune of US$1.2 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court determined that Lan was "the mastermind, committed the crime with sophisticated methods, many times, causing especially serious consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-three other defendants were also sentenced at the court in Ho Chi Minh City and given terms ranging from two to 23 years in prison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-seven of them are appealing against their sentences, state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling US$12.5 billion but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam totalled US$27 billion - equivalent to around six percent of the country's 2023 GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan owned just five percent of shares in SCB on paper but at her trial the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 percent through family, friends and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of people who had invested their savings in the bank lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said that artificial intelligence is a game changer for Hong Kong in its goal to become a more sustainable society, as the city goes all out to achieve its carbon emission goals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remarks on the second day of the "2025 Hong Kong Climate Forum" in Kowloon, where he also noted that there is an urgency to speed up the green transition in the face of more frequent extreme weather events, record-breaking heat, rising sea levels, as well as increasing stress on the public health system.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Hong Kong is dedicated to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and is especially focusing on net-zero electricity generation, green transport, buildings, and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary said that not only can AI empower specific green tech but it can act as a catalyst for encouraging behaviourial changes, while transforming various sectors and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clearly, AI has vast potential in optimising energy production and consumption," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI can also accelerate the invention of new materials. It can improve climate modelling and forecasting, enhancing our preparedness in the face of natural disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From energy-saving tech for home appliances and vehicles to smarter traffic management, these innovations are spreading across our country and the world at large," he said, adding that AI could also help optimise capital arrangements to achieve sustainable returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that Hong Kong is now developing AI on five fronts, including in super-computing capabilities, algorithms, data, capital, and talent.

    Blatter and Platini cleared of graft charges again

<img alt="Michel Platini, left, and Sepp Blatter were cleared of fraud mismanagement by a Swiss court. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797334_1_20250325173315.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court on Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former Fifa president and former Uefa president were acquitted for a second time on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of two million Swiss francs of Fifa money in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers and held his left hand over his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorney general’s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter approved Fifa paying the sum to France football great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential adviser from 1998 to 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly nine and a half years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of soccer’s most powerful men.
  <br>
  <br>
  That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at Fifa after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter’s reputation likely always will be tied to leading Fifa during corruption crises that took down a swathe of senior football officials worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, one of football’s greatest players and later Blatter’s protege in the sport's politics, never did get the Fifa presidency he often called his destiny. (AP)

    Microplastics fear for those who chew gum
   </title>

<img alt="Researchers say a gram of gum releases an average of 100 microplastic fragments and that some shed more than 600. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797333_1_20250325172205.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chewing gum releases hundreds of tiny plastic pieces straight into people's mouths, researchers said on Tuesday, also warning of the pollution created by the rubber-based sweet.
 <br>
  <br>
  The small study comes as researchers have increasingly been discovering small shards of plastic called microplastics throughout the world, from the tops of mountains to the bottom of the ocean – and even in the air we breathe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also been discovered microplastics riddled throughout human bodies – including inside our lungs, blood and brains – sparking fears about the potential effect this could be having on health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to alarm people," said Sanjay Mohanty, the lead researcher behind the new study.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no evidence directly showing that microplastics are harmful to human health, said Mohanty of the University of California, Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new pilot study instead sought to illustrate yet another little-researched way that these mostly invisible plastic pieces enter our bodies  – chewing gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lisa Lowe, a PhD student at UCLA, chewed seven pieces each of 10 brands of gum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the researchers ran a chemical analysis on her saliva.
  <br>
  <br>
  They found that a gram of gum released an average of 100 microplastic fragments, though some shed more than 600.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average weight of a stick of gum is around 1.5 grams.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who chew around 180 pieces of gum a year could be ingesting roughly 30,000 microplastics, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This pales in comparison to the many other ways that humans ingest microplastics, Mohanty emphasised.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, other researchers estimated last year that a litre of water in a plastic bottle contained an average of 240,000 microplastics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most common chewing gum sold in supermarkets is called synthetic gum, which contains petroleum-based polymers to get that chewy effect, the researchers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, packaging does not list any plastics in the ingredients, simply using the words "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohanty said that "nobody will tell you the ingredients."
  <br>
  <br>
  The researchers tested five brands of synthetic gum and five of natural gum, which use plant-based polymers such as tree sap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was surprising that we found microplastics were abundant in both," Lowe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gum shed almost all of the microplastics during the first eight minutes of chewing, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Jones, a researcher at the UK's University of Portsmouth not involved in the study, said manufacturers should be forced to give more specific ingredients than just "gum-based."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones said he was surprised that the researchers found certain plastics not known to be in gum, suggesting they could have possibly come from another source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the overall findings were "not at all surprising", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  People tend to "freak out a little bit" when told that the building blocks of chewing gum were similar to what is found "in car tyres, plastic bags and bottles", Jones said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowe also warned about the plastic pollution from chewing gum – particularly when people "spit it out onto the sidewalk".
  <br>
  <br>
  The study, which has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal but not yet published, was presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the forum was Chief Executive John Lee, who said Hong Kong is a global city connecting the world, and that the SAR will continue to promote free trade and market liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are devoted to deepening international exchange and collaboration. Hong Kong has signed investment agreements covering 33 economies, and free trade agreements covering 21 economies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aspire to add the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade pact – to our free trade agreements soon, and better contribute to regional cooperation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Equities diverged on Tuesday, as investors struggled to extend Wall Street's rally despite easing fears over US president Donald Trump's planned tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asian stocks fluctuated through the day, with Hong Kong sinking 2.3 percent to 23,344, weighed by a drop of around six percent in tech giant Xiaomi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi had raised US$5.5 billion in a mega share sale as it looked to expand its electric vehicle business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, which comes after a similar move this month by EV firm BYD, stoked worries about market liquidity. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Art Central fair is returning to Central Harbourfront from Wednesday with works from more than 100 galleries around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Corey Andrew Barr, the fair director, said he expects a good turnout for the event, which features workshops, installations and art performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Last year we had over 40,000 people here and we expect to see something similar this year, if not greater,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mark its 10th anniversary, the fair debuts the "Legend" gallery to highlight lesser-known artists from earlier generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the works on show is a collection by Japanese “rainbow artist” Ay-O as presented by Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So the Legend section is a new thing for us,” said Inessa Li, art adviser at Whitestone Gallery.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the art fair, we are just very honoured to participate in it and get more people to know this excellent talented artist.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In partnership with the Tourism Board, the fair presents three artists who explored and created works inspired by Central and Sheung Wan, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po neighbourhoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can experience the creative process in a transformed art booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because they all have their own stories that are related to the neighbourhood through their artistic approach, we want to show what's the art related to the neighbourhood and what's the significance of Hong Kong's different areas,” said curator Shirky Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cornerstone art fair runs until Sunday.

<img alt="Daniela Klette is led away to a helicopter after a detention review hearing in Karlsruhe last March. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797316_1_20250325155616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former member of Germany's far-left Baader-Meinhof gang who was arrested last year after more than 30 years on the run will face trial on Tuesday for a series of armed robberies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Daniela Klette, 66, was part of the radical anti-capitalist group also known as the Red Army Faction, which carried out a series of bombings, kidnappings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was arrested in February 2024 at her Berlin flat, where police found a Kalashnikov assault rifle, explosives and large sums of cash, after apparently hiding there in plain sight for two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks earlier, the creators of a German "most wanted" podcast had stumbled across photos of Klette on Facebook attending capoeira classes in Berlin, though it is unclear whether this led to her arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial starting on Tuesday in the northern city of Celle relates to robberies Klette allegedly committed with two other gang members to finance their life on the run after the RAF disbanded in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  After she was detained, prosecutors also had Klette formally arrested on suspicion of involvement in three attacks in the 1990s, while the gang was still active.
  <br>
  <br>
  Named after two of its early leaders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, the Baader-Meinhof gang emerged out of the radical fringe of the 1960s student protest movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's members took up arms against what they saw as US imperialism and a "fascist" German state that was still riddled with former Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the height of its notoriety in 1977, the group shot dead a German bank chief and kidnapped and killed industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, a former SS officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the so-called German Autumn of 1977 marked the beginning of a long period of decline for the RAF, the group continued to operate for another two decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette was part of a notorious trio – along with fellow gang members Ernst-Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg – who were active as part of the RAF's "third generation" in the 1980s and 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the RAF disbanded, Klette and the two men are believed to have financed their lives in hiding through armed robberies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for Staub and Garweg, who would now be 71 and 56 if they are still alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial in Celle relates to four attacks on money transporters and nine cash heists from shops in which the suspects got away with a total of 2.7 million euros, according to prosecutors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette is said to have acted mainly as the getaway driver but also faces one charge of attempted murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said she carried a "realistic-looking" dummy bazooka during some of the heists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial is set to last around two years and will hear from 12 witnesses, according to the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klette reportedly put up no resistance when she was arrested at her apartment in Berlin's bohemian Kreuzberg neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to German media reports, she had been using a fake Italian passport and going by the name of Claudia Ivone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neighbours told the Bild daily she had a partner about the same age as her and always said "hello" when she went out walking with her dog.

  <br>
  Klette had no bank account and likely paid her rent in cash, possibly for several months or years at a time, according to Der Spiegel magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attacks Klette is accused of committing in the 1990s, which are being dealt with in separate proceedings, include an attempted assault on a Deutsche Bank building in Eschborn, near Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is also accused of playing a role in a 1991 RAF attack on the US embassy in Bonn, which was the German capital at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third accusation relates to a 1993 explosives attack against a prison then still under construction in Germany's Hesse state. (AFP)

 Beijing is willing to work with Portugal to build a more stable, fruitful and dynamic relationship, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Portuguese counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is also willing to work with Portugal to promote China and Europe to become strategic partners with mutual trust, Wang said, adding that China supports Europe in maintaining its "strategic autonomy", according to a ministry statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China regards Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, and supports Europe in maintaining its strategic autonomy," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Portugal's Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel is visiting China this week, the first to the nation by a high-level Portuguese government official in over five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top officials in Beijing and European capitals are looking at each other with renewed interest as US President Donald Trump's administration threatens to upend transatlantic ties and global trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from Rangel, the French foreign minister and Italy's Senate president are all scheduled to visit China this week. (Reuters)

    Abe assassination probe leads to church's dissolution

<img alt="The Unification Church's Tokyo headquarters in Shibuya. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797307_1_20250325151020.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ordered the dissolution of the Unification Church in Japan, upholding a government request for a revocation spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tokyo District Court’s revocation of the church’s legal status means it will lose its tax-exempt privilege and must liquidate its assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the church can still appeal the decision to higher courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order follows a request by Japan’s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential South Korea-based sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation into the 2022 assassination of Abe revealed decades of cozy ties between the South Korea-based church and Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in 1968 amid an anti-communist movement supported by Abe’s grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family's financial troubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group to face a revocation order under Japan’s civil code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two earlier case involved criminal charges – the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan has in place hurdles for restraining religious activities due to lessons from the prewar and wartime oppression of freedom of religion and thought.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy at Beijing's top office on Hong Kong affairs has called on the SAR to roll out a blueprint to further drive its capital market development, seizing on opportunities brought about by the revitalisation of the city's stock market this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Giant sinkhole swallows motorcyclist in Seoul

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One person has been killed after a massive sinkhole opened up in Seoul, the fire department said on Tuesday, with harrowing video footage showing the moment his vehicle was swallowed by the hole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vast hole opened up at an intersection in the southeast of the South Korean capital during the evening rush hour around 6.30 pm on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dashcam footage by a local lawmaker shows the hole appearing abruptly in the middle of a busy street, with a motorbike being swallowed up instantly as a car narrowly escapes the same fate, sliding into the hole before somehow bouncing out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department conducted a major search, with rescue workers wearing wetsuits and "digging with their hands" alongside a rescue dog, in a frantic 17-hour hunt for the motorcyclist.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, on Tuesday "the missing person who is in his thirties, was discovered in cardiac arrest, approximately 50 metres from the centerline of the sinkhole," said Kim Chang-seop, an official from the Gangdong Fire Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was buried at a depth of approximately 90 centimeters and was found intact, still wearing his helmet and motorcycle boots," said Kim, adding they "regret that we are unable to deliver better news."
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver of the car suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hole is now around 20 metres wide and 20 metres deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of schools nearby closed on Tuesday, citing safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the sinkhole will be investigated, but the accident occurred at a site where extension work for a metro line was underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Seoul city official said it was clear the construction could have been one of "several possible contributing factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were several factors at play. Once the surrounding soil and debris are cleared, we will conduct a full investigation into the cause of the accident with a team of experts," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinkhole accidents are rare in South Korea, with fewer than 200 reported cases every year on average – significantly less than the number recorded in Japan. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land", Hamdan Ballal, was attacked by settlers and arrested by the Israeli army on Monday in the occupied West Bank, according to his co-director Yuval Abraham.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a post on X, Abraham said a "group of settlers" had set upon Ballal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat him and he has injuries in his head and stomach, bleeding. Soldiers invaded the ambulance he called, and took him. No sign of him since," Abraham wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident took place in the southern West Bank village of Susiya, according to the anti-occupation NGO Center for Jewish Nonviolence, whose members said they filmed the events first-hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said it was verifying the information when questioned by AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No Other Land", which was directed by Israeli-Palestinian activists, won best documentary at this year's Academy Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shot in nearby Masafer Yatta, the documentary follows a young Palestinian struggling with forced displacement as the Israeli army tears down his community's homes to make space for a firing zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Bank, excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, is home to around three million Palestinians as well as nearly half a million Israelis who live in settlements that are illegal under international law. (AFP)

    Tesla sales fall off a cliff in Europe

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European sales of Tesla electric cars dropped 49 percent in January and February compared with the same period a year earlier, the ACEA manufacturers' association said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ageing models are one factor behind the plunge, but electric vehicle clients may also be refusing to buy in protest of Tesla's billionaire owner Elon Musk since he became a key supporter of US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has been leading a vocal and divisive cost-cutting drive at the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Tesla dealerships around the United States have been vandalised in recent weeks and the company's stock price has plummeted over the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year, giving the company a market share of just 1.1 percent, the ACEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February alone, Tesla registrations were down 47 percent at 11,743.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sales drop came even as overall electric vehicle sales jumped 28.4 percent over the first two months of this year to 255,489 – for an EU market share of 15.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries, "The latest new car registration figures confirm that market demand for battery electric vehicles remains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  She cited a need for tax and purchasing incentives for clients and investments in recharging stations, at a time when the EU is preparing to ease emission reduction targets for struggling European automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hybrid-electric vehicles continued to be the biggest market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations – for a 35.2 percent market share.
  <br>
  <br>
  That outpaced both petrol and diesel models, with market shares of 29.1 percent and 9.7 percent in February. (AFP)

    Non-urgent A&amp;E visits to cost more in fee revamp

<img alt="Health minister Lo Chung-mau (middle) says the fee reform is aimed at directing public resources to patients most in need. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797291_1_20250325131640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Non-urgent patients seeking help at the city's public accident and emergency wards are set to pay more than double the current rate as part of the government's revamp on healthcare charges, with the new fees taking effect over three phases starting on January 1, 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive reform will also see fee adjustments for other services, such as hospital stays and consultations at specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the administration is planning to cap charges at HK$10,000 for each patient every year. It also pledged to make it easier for eligible people to apply for a fee waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health minister Lo Chung-mau said the fee reform was meant to offer more help for the underprivileged and those with severe illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the extra revenue - estimated at some HK$3 billion each year for the initial phase - will go back into public hospital services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, public A&E departments will charge patients depending on their condition, instead of the current flat rate of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critical and emergency cases will be treated for free, while the rest will have to pay HK$400 per visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities are also introducing a "co-payment model" to charge patients between HK$50 and HK$500 for advanced and highly complicated pathology and non-urgent imaging tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But basic check-ups with high demand will remain free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fees for medicine from specialist and family medicine outpatient clinics will also be adjusted, while patients will be prescribed no more than four weeks' worth of drugs each time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes are expected to lower the government's subsidy ratio for public hospital services from 97.6 percent to about 90 percent, which officials said remains a high level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Past experience showed that after this kind of structure review, a certain percentage of patients…they are more inclined to see alternative methods of care," said Hospital Authority chief executive Tony Ko.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This enables us to have more capability to reserve our manpower resources to take care of the patients who really need emergency and accidents, and urgent care."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, the government will relax the income and asset requirements to qualify for a fee waiver. About 1.4 million people are expected to benefit after the tweak, up from 300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HK$10,000 annual fee cap, meanwhile, is estimated to help about 70,000 chronic or severely-ill patients who visit hospitals frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Chan, permanent secretary for health, is confident that the government is able to shoulder the financial burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is to provide another protection for all Hong Kong citizens who may or may not be eligible to apply for medical waivers, but we will assure them that under this public subsidisation reform, they would not be required to pay an amount that is unaffordable," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The $10,000 from our estimate is less than half of the median monthly household income. So we try to maintain it to an affordable level."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Health Bureau spokesperson said while the HK$10,000 ceiling applies to all patients, it will not kick in automatically and an application must be made.
  <br>
  <br>
  All surplus fees will be refunded once the application is approved, while subsequent charges for the remainder of that calendar year will be waived, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials aimed to complete the fee reform within five years, and conduct reviews every two years.

    Relief as billiards keep Tier A status

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797283_1_20250325120446.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China welcomes the government's decision to retain the sport's Tier A status, saying the impact would have been devastating had the sport been downgraded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Tuesday, Vincent Law said the retention announcement, made a day ago, comes as a relief to both athletes and coaches, as it allows them to focus on training.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he stressed that athletes would still face the pressure of having to perform well for the sport to retain the status in the next review, which will be held in two years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law pointed out that billiard has been an elite sport since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we had dropped to Tier B this year, our funding would have been cut by about 80 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if we just look at it from a funding standpoint, it would already have been a great loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But a more severe blow would be the billiards' sector having to quit the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There would no longer be a billiard sports department, meaning that our training facilities, coaches – as well as the support that players get, such as accommodation – would all go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the move to retain the sport's status will allow the public to get to know more about billiards, and he believes more children will also try out the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there are more venues in the SAR that allow us to stage competitions, that will also help promote the sport, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will increase from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute and a Sports Commission member, said he hopes the increment can offer more stable lifestyles for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said the commission took reference from the salaries given to management trainees at various organisations before coming up with the figure.

    Cats and dogs allowed on light rail from May

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cat and dog owners will soon be able to bring pets on board the light rail on weekends and public holidays once the MTR Corporation rolls out a HK$99 monthly pet pass from May as part of a trial scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under current regulations, only guide dogs are allowed on trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-month pilot scheme will require owners to board the light rail with pets as long as they are kept in a bag that complies with luggage restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bags with a single side that exceeds 130 centimetres or having a total dimension of more than 170cm would not be allowed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Passengers also need to board or get off from a specific location of the train,” said Cheris Lee, who heads the corporation's operating and metro segment, on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the last train door of the light rail car.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Please stay within that area... so that we can also maintain a proper, comfortable environment for other passengers as well,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) advised owners to take extra care of their pets to minimise stimulation and stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to introduce the bag to the pet in advance,” said Lily Leung, senior behavioural support technician at SPCA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the pet owner to do more introductory exercises at home so that your pet likes, or even loves, staying in the bag."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that a container with good ventilation and a size large enough for pets to turn around without restrictions is needed for a comfortable journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said owners should be alert for any signs of heatstroke in pets such as vomiting, panting and excessive drooling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR Corporation said the scheme is aimed at promoting an inclusive community.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for pet owners and other passengers to be considerate of each other so the scheme can run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial period, it added, might be extended to collect more data, namely the number of pet passes sold, passenger behaviour and impact on the railway system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese authorities have released all employees of a US corporate due diligence firm detained in Beijing two years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The detained Beijing employees at Mintz Group, all Chinese nationals, have been freed, a company official said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of their release came on the heels of the just-concluded China Development Forum in Beijing attended by dozens of foreign chief executives, a platform that Chinese officials had used to bring home the message that China is open to foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful to the Chinese authorities that our former colleagues can now be home with their families," the Mintz official said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mintz has 12 offices around the world and more than 280 investigators, according to its website. (Reuters)

 In a first, M+ Museum is using artificial intelligence to transform its facade into a canvas celebrating Hong Kong's golden age of film during Art Basel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Night Charades" animation works like a fun guessing game, with the AI performing scenes for audiences to guess which films they reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created by Singaporean artist Ho Tzu-nyen, the installation features AI-generated characters performing scenes inspired by local cinema icons including Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho told RTHK that he sees the project as a homage to the city's cinema heritage and a way to transform this legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's also a work in many ways dedicated to people across Asia who also grew up with these films and these images," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure we have many Hongkongers who know these films and who have their own memories connected to these films that Night Charades is a homage to," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the fourth year of collaboration between M+ and Art Basel, joining other public art installations across the city such as at Pacific Place and Starstreet Precinct.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take a lot of pride in having the only screen in Hong Kong of that size that is an exhibition space," said Silke Schmickl, lead curator of moving image with the museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here it's really an expansion of what all other commissions can offer. It is of course a high peak season in Hong Kong during Art Basel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The nighttime display runs from March 22 to June 29 at M+ Facade.

    De Minaur finds way through Fonseca fervor in Miami

<img alt="Alex de Minaur goes for an overhead drive in his Miami Open match against Joao Fonseca at Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797270_1_20250325105235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but de Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last," de Minaur said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in two hours and 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while," said Osaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3. (AFP)

    Boeing 'wants to bail out of 737 MAX guilty plea deal'

<img alt="Two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people have fuelled deep concern over Boeing's quality and manufacturing processes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797265_1_20250325103519.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Boeing is seeking to withdraw an agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that blamed the company for deceiving regulators before two deadly crashes of 737 MAX jets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A US judge in December rejected the deal, faulting a diversity and inclusion provision, and Boeing and the Justice Department have been negotiating a new agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump took over on January 20, giving his administration a chance to weigh in on the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing declined comment. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes. The planemaker also agreed to pay a fine of up to US$487.2 million and spend US$455 million to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation as part of the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatives of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019 and killed 346 people, have called the plea agreement a "sweetheart" deal that failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  An accepted plea deal would brand Boeing a convicted felon for conspiring to defraud the US Federal Aviation Administration about problematic software affecting the flight control systems in the planes that crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May, the Justice Department found Boeing had violated the terms of a 2021 agreement that had shielded it from prosecution over the crashes. Prosecutors then decided to criminally charge Boeing and negotiate the current plea deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision followed a January 5, 2024, in-flight blowout of a door panel on an Alaska Airlines' jet that exposed ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas in 2023 said "Boeing's crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in US history."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump administration officials have said regulators must be firm with Boeing after a series of missteps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to be tougher on Boeing. We need to be tougher on the industry," said Steve Bradbury, who was confirmed as deputy transportation secretary this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing on Friday won a contract to build the US Air Force's most sophisticated fighter jet yet. (Reuters)

 The Hang Seng Index lost 262.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to open at 23,643.32 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that the US President Donald Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  April 2 is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of "reciprocal" measures -- imposing tariffs on other countries equal to those in place against the United States. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations said Monday it would “reduce its footprint” in Gaza after an Israeli tank strike hit one of its compounds last week, killing one staff member from Bulgaria and wounding five other employees.
 <br>
  <br>
  UN Secretary-General spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said the world body would temporarily remove about a third of its approximately 100 international staffers working in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to the increased danger after Israel relaunched its military campaign last week with bombardment that has since killed hundreds of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has also cut off all food, medicine, aid and other supplies to Gaza's population for the past three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric's statement was the UN's first to point the finger at Israel in the March 19 explosion at the UN guesthouse in central Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that “based on the information currently available,” the strikes on the site “were caused by an Israeli tank.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military repeated its denial that it was responsible for the strike, which took place a day after Israel shattered Gaza's two-month-old ceasefire with a surprise bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujarric said the UN had "taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the UN was “not leaving Gaza,” pointing out that it still had about 13,000 national staff in Gaza, mainly working for UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean auto giant Hyundai on Monday announced a multi-billion-dollar investment in the United States, including a new US$5.8 billion steel plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plant, which will be based in the US state of Louisiana, "will create 1,300 American jobs," Hyundai executive chairman Euisun Chung told reporters at a White House event alongside President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual capacity of 2.7 million tonnes, it is part of Hyundai's US$21 billion investment in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai's announcement makes it the latest firm to announce plans to invest billions of dollars into the United States since Trump's return to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has repeatedly threatened to impose painful tariffs on companies that do not relocate manufacturing jobs to the United States from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, domestic and foreign firms, including Apple and Oracle, have announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into US projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars are coming to this country at levels never seen before," Trump told reporters on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment was "a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hyundai will be producing steel in America and making its cars in America, and as a result, they'll not have to pay any tariffs," he added. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

<img alt="A container ship sails beneath the Golden Gate Bridge as it makes its way into port in San Francisco. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797249_1_20250325083906.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

    Procedural matters cloud first day of Depardieu trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tense first day of the trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu over sexual assault allegations ended on Monday, with both sides trading jabs on their approach to the legal procedure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu is on trial over alleged sexual assaults on a film set, in a case that placed one of France's best-known movie stars at the heart of the country's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this is the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer Jeremie Assous said the plaintiffs' refusal to conduct legal examination procedures, including a medical expertise, show that they "fear the truth, because once again, the truth is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer of one of the plaintiffs, said Depardieu's camp had been avoiding debate on the substance and is trying to prolong the legal process as much as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The procedural incidents that are stalling, those can cause stress among the victims," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial, expected to last at least two days, and possibly more, was initially due to be held in October but was postponed due to Depardieu's ill health. It will resume on Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  If found guilty, Depardieu could face a sentence of up to five years in jail and a 75,000-euro (US$81,000) fine. (Reuters)

    Venezuelan oil tariffs condemned as 'illegal'
   </title>

<img alt="An oil tanker near the Venezuelan port of La Salina. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797246_1_20250325082707.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Tuesday called on the United States to stop interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs and abolish the "illegal" unilateral sanctions on the South American country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came soon after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas, a punitive measure that could hit China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest across-the-board 25 percent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed on Monday by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorised to determine if the levy will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries, and to the United States and Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters on Monday that the 25 percent tariff would be on top of existing rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, Venezuela exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, experts told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has dubbed April 2 "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deem unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  He earlier signaled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said on Monday it might take a narrower approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Monday announcement on Truth Social involving Venezuela, the president cited "numerous reasons" for what he called a "secondary tariff."
  <br>
  <br>
  He accused Venezuela of "purposefully and deceitfully" sending "undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals" to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in his post that "Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Trump's order, the 25 percent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Caracas said on Saturday it had reached agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately on Monday, the Trump administration extended US oil giant Chevron's deadline to halt its operations in Venezuela through May 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had been operating in Venezuela under a sanctions waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest move adds to tariffs he has vowed would start on or around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides reciprocal tariffs, he has promised sweeping sector-specific duties hitting imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  As things stand, however, his plans for the day might become more targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sector-specific tariffs "may or may not happen April 2," a White House official told AFP, adding that the situation is "still fluid."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official reaffirmed that reciprocal tariffs would take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump told reporters on Monday he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  He separately added that he would announce car tariffs "very shortly" and those on pharmaceuticals sometime down the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  US partners are furthering talks with Washington as deadlines loom, with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic heading to the country on Tuesday to meet his American counterparts -- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout gave financial markets a boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo last week that Washington would go to trading partners with an indication of where tariff levels and non-tariff barriers are.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stopped their practices, Bessent added, they could potentially avoid levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same interview, Bessent noted that levies would be focused on about 15 percent of countries who have trade imbalances with the United States, dubbing these a "dirty 15." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Monday as traders welcomed news that the administration of President Donald Trump may dial down upcoming tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told AFP the sector-specific levies "may or may not happen" as planned on April 2, adding that the situation was fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 percent to end trading at 42,583.32, and the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent to 5,767.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.3 percent to 18,188.59.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade news was "definitely the main cause" of the rise in Wall Street stocks, Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors clearly hate the idea of tariffs," he said. "So any news that implies that the burden of tariffs will be will be lighter than expected will be taken as a positive by the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Elon Musk's Tesla shot up 11.9 percent as traders piled back into the embattled stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  And United Airlines saw its share price jump 7.2 percent after announcing it was hiking fees on some credit cards and airline lounges. (AFP)

 Top Trump administration officials, including US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, mistakenly included a journalist in a messaging group discussing strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis, according to a firsthand account by The Atlantic magazine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said in a report on Monday that he was inadvertently invited on March 13 to an encrypted chat group on the Signal messaging app called the "Houthi PC small group." In the group, national security adviser Mike Waltz tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a "tiger team" to coordinate US action against the Houthis.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump launched an ongoing campaign of large-scale military strikes against Yemen's Houthis on March 15 over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, and he has warned Iran, the Houthis' main backer, that it needed to immediately halt support for the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before those attacks started, Hegseth posted operational details about the plan, "including information about targets, weapons the US would be deploying, and attack sequencing," Goldberg said, declining to disclose the details of what he termed the "shockingly reckless" use of the Signal chat to coordinate the strike.

  , RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said the extent of the leak was astonishing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is absolutely breathtaking. It is jaw dropping. It breaches every single national security protocol that not only this government in the United States would traditionally follow, but that governments all over the world would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Marks said it was more likely a mistake rather than a deliberate leak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It certainly appears to have been a monumental accident, but also it raises massive questions about how many more sensitive government national security conversations have been taking place across commercially available apps."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Defence Department referred a Reuters request for comment to the National Security Council, and NSC spokesman Brian Hughes said the chat group appeared to be authentic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security," Hughes said. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong's rising tennis star Coleman Wong on Monday fell short of a third round victory at this year's Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old fell to Australian Adam Walton, who won 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 in a match-up that lasted for two hours and 18 minutes at the Hard Rock Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong previously pulled off a stunning win of his own in Miami, beating American 13th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory provided him with a place in the third round of a Masters 1000 for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong – currently ranked 182th in the world – was the second-lowest ranked player to reach the Miami Open third round in 10 years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Civil Aviation Department on Monday announced that local airlines will no longer let passengers use or recharge their portable chargers during flights, while storing power banks in the overhead compartments is also banned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new rules will come into effect on April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department said it is highly concerned about recent safety incidents linked to passengers using lithium battery power banks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the decision was made after meeting representatives from local airlines last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last Thursday, a Hong Kong Airlines flight en route to the SAR was forced to make an emergency landing in Fuzhou after a fire, believed to be triggered by a portable charging device, broke out in the cabin. In January, an Air Busan plane that was about to take off for Hong Kong went up in flames at Busan Airport after a charger caught fire.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say new fees for public hospital services will be rolled out in three phases starting as early as January next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fee at the accident and emergency unit will be raised from the current HK$180 to no more than HK$400, with exemptions for patients who need urgent care or are critically ill.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's expected that higher A&E charges will allocate more resources to treat the critically ill and reduce the number of non-urgent cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials hope the new fee system will be in place in five years, with reviews every two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources added that there will be a cap on inpatient and outpatient fees, likely set at HK$10,000 per person per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall funding rate for public healthcare will be maintained at 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reform aims to enhance patient protection, optimise the medical fee waiver mechanism to provide assistance to needy patients, and strengthen support for critical illness medications and equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources also said the Samaritan Fund could be relaxing its application requirements so middle-class patients facing severe illness who cannot afford expensive treatment costs could receive assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau is set to announce the details on Tuesday.

    Billiards, tennis retain Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324223333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

    Cityline 'must explain Coldplay ticket errors'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary for culture, sports and tourism has called on the ticketing platform Cityline to explain misprints on Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the platform's website, the inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law pointed out that the platform has to apologise over the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cityline must explain why it went wrong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's the platform that is in charge of receiving the instructions on how to print the tickets, what tickets were to be printed, as well as the matching afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, they have to explain it."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that once the government learnt of the incident, it requested the platform make clear remedial and ticket-exchange arrangements swiftly to those who are affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said Cityline and organisers need to have a contingency plan in place in the event that ticket holders do not manage to exchange the misprinted tickets in time for the concerts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will closely monitor the situation and make requests and provide guidance when necessary, she added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Monday faced a no-confidence motion in parliament as the opposition alleged she was being unduly influenced by her father, a former prime minister, and is mismanaging the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country’s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong is the leader of the People’s Party , a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home .
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn was also accused by Prawit Wongsuwan, head of the Palang Pracharath Party, Pheu Thai’s former coalition partner, of falsely declaring her assets, which she denied. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pharmaceutical firms wishing to register new drugs in Hong Kong will soon be able to consult health officials before filing an actual application, saving both sides time and effort.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since November 2023, the Department of Health has made it easier for new drugs to be registered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Called the "1+" mechanism, pharmaceutical products would only need a single registration issued by an existing reference drug regulatory authority, down from two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Initially open to drugs used to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, the rule was further extended last year to all new drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven new drugs have so far been registered under the regime, five of which have already been added to the Hospital Authority's formulary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department added that as of mid-March, it has received 400 enquiries from more than 110 pharmaceutical companies on drug registration matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  To better help the industry understand the regulatory requirements, it will launch a consultation service starting with an online briefing seminar next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Director of Health Frank Chan noted that some overseas or mainland firms are not familiar with the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not quite sure or quite understand our registration requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once they got the information, they may discuss with their company to see whether they want to go ahead with the applications...  so that we [don't have] to go back and forth to ask them to provide the supplementary information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will enhance our efficiency for the approval of the application," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the department is planning to hold workshops in June and meet potential applicants face to face later in the year to further expedite the process.

    Heathrow 'had enough power to stay open on Friday'

<img alt="The National Grid's boss, John Pettigrew, says either of the two other substations could have supplied the power to keep Heathrow open on Friday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797178_1_20250324172618.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the UK's national grid has said there was "enough power" to keep Heathrow Airport running on Friday, after an electrical substation fire shuttered Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown, which lasted most of the day, affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised questions about the reliability of one of the UK's key pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Grid chief executive John Pettigrew told the Financial Times on Sunday that power had remained available to the airport in west London through two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was no lack of capacity from the substations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Losing a substation is a unique event – but there were two others available."
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport officials said the closure was due to the time it took to switch to the other substations and make safety checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted," a Heathrow Airport official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed, meaning systems had to be closed so power supplies could be restructured from the two other substations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire officials have said the blaze, which broke out on Thursday night, was "believed to be non-suspicious" and that enquiries would "focus on the electrical distribution equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Monday about the way airport bosses handled the events, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: "I'm not going to justify decisions that Heathrow leadership did or didn't take."  (AFP)

    HK ends up on mixed day for equities

<img alt="The benchmark Hang Seng Index was up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797176_1_20250324171443.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56 on a mixed day for equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.24 percent to end at 8,850.69, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.72 percent to end at 5,736.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equity markets were mixed as worries about fresh US tariffs pencilled in for next week were tempered by a report that Donald Trump was considering a more targeted approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has caused ructions on trading floors since resuming power in January by hitting out at long-standing allies and imposing or threatening swingeing tariffs on imports of an array of goods, including steel and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next Wednesday is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of reciprocal measures to counter those in other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anticipation and pre-positioning ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' on April 2 and the impending deluge of tariff-related announcements that will follow in the days/weeks after will be a growing factor that drives price action, sentiment and liquidity in markets this week," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the sky begins to bruise and darken, and the atmospheric pressure builds within the capital markets, market players question if it's time to batten down the hatches in preparation for a storm of uncertainty set to be unleashed on markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve last week warned that "uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased" while the central banks of Japan and Britain also warned about the impact of the White House's policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang said at the weekend that Beijing was readying for "shocks that exceed expectations" ahead of the latest measures, adding that "instability and uncertainty are on the upswing."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as he met heads of some of the world's biggest companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, FedEx and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was some hope among investors amid reports the US administration was considering a more targeted approach to the tariffs, with some countries being hit harder than others, and the measures not being as severe as initially feared.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after the president said on Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asian markets fluctuated through the day, with Tokyo falling along with Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai and Wellington joined Hong Kong in edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt opened on the front foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold held around US$3,025, having hit a series of records last week to a peak of more than $3,057 owing to a surge in demand for safe havens. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Monday said it will implement a more proactive fiscal policy this year, with finance minister Lan Fo'an saying the nation's economic and fiscal strengths have grown significantly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the last day of the China Development Forum 2025, Lan said China has gained more experience in macroeconomic management and fiscal governance, and that confidence in the nation's economic development stems from solid fundamentals, numerous advantages, resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Lan said the primary task of this year's fiscal policy is to significantly boost consumption and enhance investment efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has the world's most promising super-sized market, with immense potential for consumption growth," Lan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to global business leaders attending the forum, Lan also emphasised that China will ensure equal treatment for all types of businesses and continue to improve the business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, senior executives of multinational giants attending the forum have highlighted the importance of strengthening global cooperation to ensure that industrial and supply chains can withstand unexpected external shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives told broadcaster CCTV that this meant that they have to come together across borders and industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide Corporation noted there is a tremendous supply chain for the elevator industry on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is our largest manufacturing location anywhere in the world. And so we take advantage of the supply chain here not just for China in China, but also in China for the world," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entrepreneurs, government officials, experts and business representatives from China and around the world attended the two-day forum – themed "Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global Economy".

    US-Russia talks on Ukraine begin in Saudi Arabia

<img alt="Different plans for temporary ceasefires in the Ukraine war have been proposed, but attacks have continued unabated. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797165_1_20250324162833.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials opened talks in Saudi Arabia on Monday on a partial ceasefire in the Ukraine war, a day after delegates from Washington and Kyiv had their own discussions.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and hopes talks in Riyadh could pave the way for a breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides have proposed different plans for temporary ceasefires, but cross-border attacks have meanwhile continued unabated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally planned to take place simultaneously to enable shuttle diplomacy – with the United States going back and forth between the delegations – the talks are now taking place one after the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting between the Ukrainian team, led by defence minister Rustem Umerov, and the Americans finished up late on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The discussion was productive and focused – we addressed key points including energy," Umerov said on social media, adding Ukraine was working to make its goal of a "just and lasting peace" a reality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way for a "full-on" ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you'll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire," he told Fox News.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are only at the beginning of this path," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there were many outstanding questions over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities said on Monday they would deploy dozens of helicopters and thousands of firefighters and soldiers as they struggle to control multiple wildfires in the southeast, which have been burning for days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been killed so far, with officials warning that high winds and rising temperatures were hindering efforts to put out the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Uiseong, nearly 7,000 hectares of land has been affected and around 600 people evacuated, said Lim Sang-seop, head of the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 57 wildfire fighting helicopters are to be deployed to extinguish the fire," he said, adding that more than 2,600 fire fighting personnel – including soldiers – would be mobilised "to respond with all their might."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire had been partly contained but was still burning as of Monday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in multiple locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A major wildfire claimed four lives over the weekend in Sancheong county, in South Gyeongsang province, about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire was also partly contained by Monday – but still burning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government declared a state of emergency in the affected regions, citing "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated as acting president on Monday, visited the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, urging authorities to work together "until the wildfires are completely extinguished."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a truly heartbreaking incident," he said, adding that he would meet people affected by the fires later on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, urged authorities to "mobilise all means at their disposal to quickly and safely suppress the fires" and take further measures to prevent any additional wildfires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other phenomena such as forest fires, droughts, snowstorms and tropical storms can result from a combination of complex factors. (AFP)
