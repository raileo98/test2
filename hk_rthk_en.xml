<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

    'New private sector law must rollout gradually'

<img alt="Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the 'private economy promotion law', aimed at creating a fairer business environment. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795827_2_20250315105255.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the "private economy promotion law", which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures - analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC, aimed to crackdown on the so-called, "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with each other excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

    Crew launch to ISS to replace stuck astronauts

<img alt="SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifts off, carrying NASA's Crew-10 astronauts to the International Space Station at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795820_1_20250315083347.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than nine months on the International Space Station, two astronauts are a step closer to returning home following the launch of a crew swap mission on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Falcon 9 rocket with a Crew Dragon fixed to its top blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying a four-member team bound for the orbital outpost.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We celebrate the countless individuals all over the world that have made this journey possible," said astronaut Nichole Ayers, the designated pilot of the Crew-10 mission, just before launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the real focus is what their arrival enables - the long-overdue departure from the ISS of NASA duo Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two former US Navy pilots have been stuck aboard the orbital lab since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Starliner returned empty, without experiencing further major issues and what was meant to have been a days-long round-trip for Wilmore and Williams has now stretched past nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.
  <br>
  <br>
  What began as a technical failure has also spiraled into a political flashpoint, as President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX, have repeatedly suggested that former president Joe Biden "abandoned" the pair intentionally and rejected a plan to bring them back sooner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, has drawn attention for his bizarre remarks about the situation, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as "the woman with the wild hair" and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've been left up there. I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don't know," he said during a recent White House press conference. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, while the Dow index was mostly up. (AFP)

    Putin tells Ukraine troops in Kursk to 'surrender'

<img alt="Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting with members of the Security Council via video link. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795805_1_20250315050817.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on beleaguered Ukrainian troops in the Russian region of Kursk to "surrender" as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Russian leader of seeking to sabotage a ceasefire initiative.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump urged Putin to spare the lives of the Ukrainian troops as he said his envoy had held "productive" talks with Russia's leader on a proposed 30-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive in the western border region of Kursk over the past week, recapturing much of the territory Ukraine seized in a shock incursion last August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat in Kursk would be a major blow to Ukraine's plans to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in peace talks for the three-year-old war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in remarks broadcast on Russian television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said "thousands" of Ukrainian troops were "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's military leadership denied the claims. "There is no threat of our units being encircled," Ukraine's General Staff posted on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky gave a more sober assessment in comments to reporters in Kyiv. "The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," he said, while insisting the campaign still had value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest comments came as he gave an update on a meeting on Thursday between his envoy Steve Witkoff and Putin on a US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day pause in hostilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said on Thursday that he had "serious questions" about the proposal and that events in Kursk would influence the next moves towards a ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Friday that it was "cautiously optimistic" a deal could be reached, but that Trump and Putin had to speak directly before talks could progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin, addressing his Security Council, said he had read Trump's appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While accusing Ukrainian troops of carrying out crimes against civilians that he said amounted to "terrorism", something Kyiv denies, Putin said he understood the call by Trump to take humanitarian considerations into account. (Agencies)

    Mark Carney sworn in as Canada's PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Carney was formally sworn in as prime minister of Canada on Friday, putting him in a position to fight tariffs from US President Donald Trump that could devastate the trade-dependent Canadian economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Governor General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles, who is Canada's head of state, Carney took the oath of office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moment capped a momentous rise for the 59-year-old, who became the first Canadian prime minister without any serious political experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney plans to travel to London and Paris next week, said a diplomat aware of the plans. Canada has sought to shore up alliances in Europe as its relations with the United States sink to unprecedented lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney has reshaped his cabinet with a view to dealing with Washington. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc is moving to the international trade portfolio and will be replaced by current Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney crushed his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He replaces Justin Trudeau, who spent more than nine years in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former head of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, successfully argued his position as an outsider with a history of tackling crises meant he was the best person to take on Trump, who has repeatedly talked about annexing Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Carney told reporters that he was ready to meet Trump when "there is respect for Canadian sovereignty."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he would keep in place retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the United States showed Canada some respect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts are underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney in the next couple of days, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on Friday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte failed to show in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of his crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, was following by video link during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. The presiding judge allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance to get justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fallout with the ruling Marcos family. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday called on members of the public to exercise caution when travelling to the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reminder came as the World Health Organisation reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia, involving chronically-ill men aged between 27 and 78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the patients have passed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the CHP said one of the infected patients has had indirect contact with dromedary camels and their raw milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The CHP also recommends travel agents organising tours to the Middle East to refrain from arranging for visitors to ride dromedary camels or to participate in any activities involving direct contact with dromedary camels, which are known risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also reminded people to maintain good personal hygiene.

    Rashford recalled in Tuchel's first England squad

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A male visitor at Kwong Wah Hospital has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a nurse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The hospital revealed that the nurse's arm was injured in the incident that happened in a ward on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said other medical staff and security officers were alerted, and reported the case to the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nurse was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department for treatment, and has since been discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is highly concerned about the incident, expressed sympathy and rendered necessary support to the nurse," a Hospital Authority statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital resolutely adopts a zero-tolerance attitude to any workplace violence and strongly condemns the violent act."

<img alt="The MV Stena Immaculate tanker was hit by the MV Solong container vessel on March 10. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795780_1_20250314214139.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Friday again extended the detention of the captain of a cargo ship that struck a tanker in the North Sea, citing the "complexities" of the case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Russian captain was arrested on Monday on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter after his ship, the Solong, slammed into the tanker anchored off the coast of Hull in northeastern England, setting both ships ablaze and leaving one sailor presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were granted two extensions on Wednesday and Thursday to allow more time to question the 59-year-old captain due to "the complexities of the incident," the local Humberside police force said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police cited the location of both vessels at sea as one of the complications facing the probe, with the ships on fire for several days after the incident, requiring a massive firefighting response.
  <br>
  <br>
  While all crew onboard the jet fuel-laden tanker, the US-flagged Stena Immaculate, were safely rescued, one sailor from the Portuguese-flagged Solong remains missing and presumed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the government has ruled out foul play, investigators are still determining the causes of the crash, in which the Solong never deviated from its course and slammed into the Stena at 16 knots an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pockets of fire were still being reported on the deck of the Solong on Thursday evening, according to the UK Coastguard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Extensive lines of enquiry are continuing," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salvage teams boarded the vessels on Thursday to carry out initial damage assessments. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Safe-haven gold surpassed US$3,000 for the first time on Friday, boosted by uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while stock markets gained on hopes US lawmakers will avert a government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Markets hate uncertainty, and Trump's second tenure in the White House has served to provide huge instability over expectations for trade, jobs, inflation, and government spending," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Asian equities managed to end the week on a positive note while European markets were also up in midday deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks gained support from "hopes that the US government would avoid a shutdown of non-essential services," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just hours until a deadline to push a Republican spending bill through, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package would keep the lights on through September, but Democrats have come under pressure from their grassroots to defy the plan, which they say is full of harmful spending cuts. (AFP)

    Drop in pupil numbers 'structural and would worsen'

<img alt="Christine Choi says measures are needed to ensure the stable and sustainable development of the education sector. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795759_1_20250314180708.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi said on Friday the government was left with little choice but to change rules on how local schools can continue to operate, as Hong Kong faces a dwindling pupil population.
 <br>
  <br>
  She described the drop in student numbers as a "structural" rather than a "transitional" issue, and that it would only exacerbate in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week, the Education Bureau announced tighter restrictions on how schools can continue to receive government funding, which effectively increased the risk of them closing down if they don't enrol enough students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under current policy, schools can operate a class on private money for a year, and resume receiving government funding once they can meet the minimum intake of 16 pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  From September, such classes cannot revert to private funding again for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  And schools that are allowed to go private must ensure their pupils complete their primary education using private funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past few years, we have lowered the class formation requirement. But today, we think basically all possible methods, all adjustments have been exhausted," Choi told reporters after attending an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must face this problem squarely. We need to implement measures for the education sector's stable and sustainable development in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that there had been fears more than 10 schools could face closure this year, but it turned out that only two were affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for education also said early next month, officials will reach out to parents whose children are due to attend Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Southern District's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School, two schools that won't receive government grants to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the two schools, which are left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure, have to decide the way forward themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only pupils who applied for the spots under the discretionary scheme would be affected, Choi said, because no pupils had been sent there through central allocation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Choi said students going on mainland study tours are reminded not to consume cold dishes, after dozens of students and teachers on such tours from three schools were said to have contracted gastroenteritis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health officials said they all went to eat at the same location in Shaoguan in Guangdong province, but the education chief stressed there's no evidence their illnesses had to do with food served during the tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that to be on the safe side, operators of mainland study tours have stopped providing cold dishes.

    New AI tool helps SMEs with green transition

<img alt="HKGCC chair Agnes Chan says that the AI-empowered tool will support small businesses to develop ESG audit without significant costs. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795746_2_20250314170438.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong businesses, specially small and medium-sized ones, are set to receive a boost to enhance their environmental, social and governance practices with the launch of a new AI tool to help them comply with rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Green360 was launched by The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Friday, and it is an online learning platform aimed at helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to start and develop their environmental, social and governance (ESG) audit and reporting processes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a launch ceremony, Algernon Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, said the platform represents a pivotal step in Hong Kong's push forward as part of its sustainability agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The introduction of Green360 comes at a crucial time as we navigate the complexities of environmental challenges for sustainable practices that are urgently needed. This innovative platform not only aligns with the global movement towards a greener economy but also emphasizes Hong Kong's role as a leader in integrating advanced technology commercial development," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since January 25, all companies are required by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move also came as the government rolled out a road map in December to align its sustainability disclosure requirements with International Financial Reporting Standards – Sustainability Disclosure (ISSB) Standards by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yau, HKGCC chairwoman Agnes Chan noted that the tool, which is empowered by artificial intelligence technology, will help speed up the city's green transition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "AI is emerging as a crucial driver for integrating green and just transitions, digital platforms and data analytics pivotal in accelerating the de-carbonisation of both the economy and the capital markets," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many companies are uncertain about where to begin or lack the resources to pursue such initiatives. So Green360 alleviates these concerns by helping them to identify areas for improvement and achieve accreditation without incurring significant costs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fillippo Addarri, senior advisor for the United Nations Development Programme and project lead for the European Union Social Impact Score, said at the same event that Hong Kong and the European members could cooperate over green finance following increased economic ties between Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that Chinese green investments in Europe, such as in the battery and electric vehicle fields, have seen a 50 percent increase year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And as a global financial hub, Hong Kong is poised to become a key partner of the European Union. Your advanced regulatory framework and culture of innovation sets your leadership in the driving seat," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on the question of support from Beijing, Xin Bingxian, executive secretary of the World Development Foundation, said at the event that the move is in line with the direction signalled from the Two Sessions meetings this year that carbon reduction requirements are shifting from voluntary to mandatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she suggested the SAR government cooperate with mainland authorities to also align on ESG disclosure rules as there are notable differences in regulations.

  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    Lunar eclipse brings 'bloody' marvellous spectacle

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stargazers across a swathe of the world marvelled at a dramatic red "Blood Moon" during a rare total lunar eclipse in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The celestial spectacle was visible in the Americas and Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as well as in the westernmost parts of Europe and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon happens when the sun, earth and moon line up, causing our planet to cast a giant shadow across its satellite.
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the earth's shadow crept across the moon, it did not entirely blot out its white glow. Instead the moon glowed a reddish colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because the only sunlight that reaches the moon is "bent and scattered" as it goes through earth's atmosphere, said Daniel Brown, an astronomer at Britain's Nottingham Trent University.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is similar to how the light can become pink or red during sunrises or sunsets on earth, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The more clouds and dust there are in earth's atmosphere, the redder the moon appears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown called the lunar eclipse, which will last around six hours, "an amazing way to see the solar system in action."
  <br>
  <br>
  The period when the moon is completely in earth's shadow, called the totality, lasts just over an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  This event has been dubbed the "Blood Worm Moon," after one of the names given to March full moons by some Native Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first total lunar eclipse since 2022, but there will be another one in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's event is a "Micromoon," meaning the moon is the farthest away it gets from earth, making it appear about seven percent smaller than normal, according to the website Earthsky.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the opposite of a "Supermoon," as was seen during 2022's lunar eclipse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some stargazers will be in for another treat later this month. That will be a partial solar eclipse. (AFP)

    Hospitals may start charging for CT and MRI scans

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on Friday the government is reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, including charging for such services as CT scans and MRIs to prevent abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, he said that emergency and hospitalised patients would be exempted.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The demand for some complicated imaging services such as CT scans and MRIs keeps increasing, and prolongs the waiting time. We will consider having a co-payment on such services,” Lo said after a health services panel meeting in the Legislative Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have to stress that these items are completely free now, as they are fully funded by the government, and that has led to an excessive use of services,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment of fees and charges is needed to reduce waste in such areas as medication so that resources can be utilised accurately and directed towards helping patients whose conditions are more serious or who need more urgent treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will take affordability into account when changing the fees and charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said the adjustment in public hospital fees is an important step in primary healthcare development, and people are encouraged to consult their family doctors instead when their symptoms are mild.

 Tourist arrivals hit 8.4 million in the first two months of the year, a seven percent increase year on year, the Hong Kong Tourism Board said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of them – or 6.5 million – were from the mainland, an uptick of four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from other short-haul markets also rose, with those from the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea each surging more than 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers from long-haul markets grew as well, up 20 percent to 500,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrivals from Australia, for example, saw a 34 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong celebrated the start of the Year of the Snake on January 29, hosting a series of events such as the Lunar New Year parade and a fireworks display.

    US Senate in race to avert government shutdown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate finds itself on Friday in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare as Democrats confront two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late on Thursday made clear he will not allow a shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A procedural vote on Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  “While the CR still is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they've resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about US$13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about US$6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly US$1.7 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter. (AP)

    Alcaraz stays on track for third Indian Wells title

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz reacts after winning his quarter-final match against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795712_1_20250314142648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals of the Indian Wells ATP Masters.
 <br>
  <br>
  On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he stayed on track in his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really difficult for me to start the match," said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He got a lot of chances in the first set," Alcaraz said. "I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults, including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Daniil Medvedev, runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat young gun Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune, a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in two hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023, when he won five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round. (AFP)

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

 Some parents at a primary school that won't get public funding to operate first-year classes in the next academic year said on Friday they're shocked by the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin is one of two schools left with the options of running the primary one class with private funds, merging with other schools or facing an eventual closure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other one is Southern's Aplichau Kaifong Primary School.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Wong Tai Sin school, a mother said that all three of her children attend the school or had done so, and she's among parents who're concerned it may ultimately be forced to close.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My children and pupils like the school a lot, they like the teachers here," she said. "When our children learned of the news, they were like, 'oh why? I don't want this,'"
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we hope the school can continue and persist."
  <br>
  <br>
  School principal Maureen Ho said it notified parents of the news on Thursday night once the government announced the funding decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it's early days still as to what will happen, but the school will discuss a way forward in an attempt to come up with the best arrangement for the pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we got the news we found it regrettable and weren't too happy. But it's a decision made by the Education Bureau so we have to respect that," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We care a lot about our pupils, so our management will discuss different plans with our council and sponsoring body, as well as education officials, to help them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho noted that the lack of pupils is a territory-wide issue, adding that the school particularly had trouble attracting new pupils because it is hard to get to.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, schools that faced the same problem could go private for a year and, once they were able to meet the minimum class intake of more than 16 pupils, resume receiving government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the government changed the rule this week, requiring schools to operate a class with private funds for six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education officials also said if schools take in less than 16 pupils again within that period, they won't be allowed to go private again.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the change was made because the number of pupils projected to enter primary schools in the coming years is expected to drop by just over 11,000 to around 37,500 in 2031.

 An American Airlines plane caught fire after landing at Denver International Airport, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight 1006, which was headed from Colorado Springs to Dallas, diverted to Denver and landed safely around 5.15pm on Thursday after the crew reported engine vibrations, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While taxiing to the gate, an engine on the Boeing 737-800 caught fire, the FAA added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stood on one of the plane’s wings as smoke surrounded the aircraft. The FAA said passengers exited using the slides.
  <br>
  <br>
  American said the flight experienced an engine-related issue after taxiing to the gate. There was no immediate clarification on exactly when the plane caught fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 172 passengers and six crew members were taken to the terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We thank our crew members, DEN team and first responders for their quick and decisive action with the safety of everyone on board and on the ground as the priority,” American said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters put out the blaze by  evening, an airport spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FAA said it will investigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel, though flying remains a very safe mode of transport. (AP)

 People around the globe marked World Sleep Day on Friday, an annual event that serves as a reminder of the importance of sleep to one's well-being and health.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on

   </u>
  </a>
  , Julia Sun, a clinical psychologist at the Chinese University's Department of Psychiatry, said people should not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sleep is really important and it is related to the physical and mental well-being. Physically, chronic sleep depravation will lead to reduced immune function and hormonal imbalance. And also we can see that when people sleep less, they tend to gain more weight. Sleep depravation is also linked to increased cardiovascular risk," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of mental well-being, insomnia, or sleeping less, leads to increased irritability... it also leads to more mood swings and also difficulty in managing stress."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun recommended that people get into a routine before bed, to ensure a good night's sleep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that regularity is important - try to have a regular sleep-wake schedule no matter in weekdays or weekends... try to limit the screen use before sleep, for example like 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. And also you can dim your light before you go to sleep."

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

<img alt="DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam welcomed government proposals to extend the storage time for eggs, sperm and embryos in Hong Kong. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795688_1_20250314110717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam on Friday welcomed the government's initiative on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Thursday announced it would launch a public consultation on issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>

    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said many people were starting families later in life which is why an adjustment to current regulations was needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More and more couples are getting married late and planning their families late... and if you look at some of the restrictions to current [regulations] we're having such as this 10-year period, it's pretty much outdated. We do need a full-on upgrade of a lot of the rules and regulations around this to ensure that it fits with current trends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said easing restrictions on non-married couples or single people, allowing them to use their frozen embryos to start a family, would also help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment it might be a little bit tricky, but we do need to do more persuasive discussions in Hong Kong," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical sector lawmaker David Lam, speaking on an RTHK programme, said the proposed measure was helpful, but people also needed to understand that, if possible, it is better to start a family sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to let people know that this option is not for everyone, it is a choice for those with a unique problem. It should not become an option for people to delay childbearing. We should have children as early as possible.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that pregnancy difficulties and health risks would increase as women get older which was another reason not to delay starting a family.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes netted a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday, while Tottenham bounced back to edge AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rangers knocked out Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-2 on penalties as Chelsea saw out a 1-0 home win against Copenhagen to ensure their place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two spot-kicks and a late arrowed finish from Fernandes sent Man Utd into the quarter-finals by a 5-2 aggregate margin against 10-man Sociedad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it," Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim said of his captain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  A 10th-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead at Old Trafford before Fernandes converted from 12 yards in the 16th and 50th minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Aramburu saw red shortly after the hour and Man Utd took full advantage with Fernandes rifling in a third three minutes from time and Diogo Dalot rubber-stamping an emphatic victory in injury-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side will meet Lyon in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals in either half from Wilson Odobert and James Maddison in London earned Spurs a 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert powered home following sloppy AZ defending to get Spurs level on aggregate in the 26th minute, after the first leg finished 1-0 to the Dutch side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maddison put the hosts 2-0 up three minutes into the second period with an arrowed finish before Peer Koopmeiners responded after the hour to level the tie again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert grabbed his second and Spurs' third on the night in the 74th minute to set up a quarter-final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times," Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing the first leg in Istanbul 3-1, Fenerbahce fought back at Rangers to win 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski produced two cute finishes in the 45th and 73rd minutes to force extra-time with the aggregate score locked at three-apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  But three missed spot-kicks by the Turkish side handed Rangers a 3-2 win in the shoot-out and a last-eight clash with Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall got the winner 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea through the Conference League quarter-finals at the expense of Copenhagen, 3-1 over both legs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen of China 6-3, 6-3, avenging her Olympics semi-final loss to the Paris Games gold medallist, to reach the last four at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number two from Poland will get a chance to avenge another upset loss in the semi-finals, where she'll take on Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who stunned her in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek delivered another dominant performance as she continued her bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who won her first Indian Wells title in 2022, could also join Martina Navratilova as the only women to lift the trophy in back-to-back years.
  <br>
  <br>
  After dropping just two games in each of her first three matches, Swiatek was broken twice as she faced her toughest test so far, but secured the victory with a flourish as she broke Zheng at love in the final game after a brief shower paused play late in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek converted all five of her break chances. Zheng twice surrendering her serve in games she led 40-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng did manage late breaks in each set, but neither those hiccups nor the brief shower that paused play in the second set proved much impediment to Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end it got really windy, which made it super tricky," Swiatek said. ""When the conditions change during the match you need to adjust quickly and it's not that easy. I'm happy that I was pushing until the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek admitted she was pleased to avenge her Olympic defeat, a heartbreaking loss on the Philippe Chatrier court where the Polish star has won four French Open titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not nice to lose to anybody, so for sure you want to have a little, like revenge, but it's nothing personal," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She can settle another score against Andreeva, who kept her bid for another prestigious title on track with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Ukrainian veteran Elina Svitolina. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia is reviewing an American influencer’s visa after she posted video of her snatching a baby wombat from its mother.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam Jones, who describes herself as an “outdoor enthusiast & hunter,” made her Instagram account private on Thursday after she was widely condemned for the video.
  <br>
  <br>
  It shows her lifting the wombat joey by its front legs in darkness from a roadside and running away from its mother.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I caught a baby wombat,” she says, as a man filming her laughs. She returns the wombat to the roadside after several seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said her visa was under review.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The department is now working through the conditions on her current visa and determining whether immigration law has been breached,” Burke said in a statement on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I can’t wait for Australia to see the back of this individual, I don’t expect she will return,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added his voice to the criticism. “To take a baby wombat from its mother, and clearly causing distress from the mother, is just an outrage,” Albanese told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I suggest to this so-called influencer, maybe she might try some other Australian animals. Take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there. Take another animal that can actually fight back rather than stealing a baby wombat from its mother,” Albanese added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones, who also uses the name Samantha Strable, closed her social media channels to messages and couldn’t be reached for comment on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The wombat appears to be a common wombat, also known as a bare-nosed wombat. It is a protected marsupial found only in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yolandi Vermaak, founder of the animal care charity Wombat Rescue, said separating the young wombat from its mother created a risk that the mother would reject her offspring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “My biggest concern is that we didn’t actually see mom and baby getting reunited. When she put it down, it looked disoriented. It was turned away from where the mother was last seen. So we don’t know if mom and baby actually found each other again,” Vermaak told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. (AP)

    Johns Hopkins University to cut thousands of jobs

<img alt="President Trump signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795666_1_20250314084123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The prestigious Johns Hopkins University said on Thursday it was being forced to lay off more than 2,000 employees in the aftermath of the Trump administration's massive reduction in foreign aid funding.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult day for our entire community. The termination of more than US$800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally," the school, a leading institution of scientific research, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopkins, in Maryland's largest city an hour's drive north of the US capital, is eliminating more than 2,000 positions - 1,975 in projects across 44 countries and 247 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts impact several key programs, including the university's medical school and school of public health, and Jhpiego, a global health non-profit organisation founded at the university more than 50 years ago and which works to improve health in countries worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Johns Hopkins is immensely proud of the work done by our colleagues in Jhpiego, the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the School of Medicine to care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water, and advance countless other critical, life-saving efforts around the world," the university said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cuts make Johns Hopkins one of the universities most deeply impacted by the slash of federal funding for research.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university receives roughly US$1 billion annually in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is currently running 600 clinical trials, according to The New York Times, adding that Hopkins is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging such cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Agency for International Development (USAID), the largest funding agency for Jhpiego, distributes humanitarian aid around the world, with health and emergency programs in around 120 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, who is dismantling the humanitarian agency, signed an executive order in January demanding a freeze on all US foreign aid to allow time to assess overseas expenses. Critics warn that slashing USAID work will affect millions of people. (AFP)

    Duterte's first court appearance set for Friday

<img alt="People protest against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte in front of the ICC in the Hague. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795667_1_20250314085246.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rodrigo Duterte's first appearance at the International Criminal Court has been set for Friday, the court said, as the former Philippines president faces crimes against humanity charges over his deadly war on drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement from the court late on Thursday said Duterte's first appearance would take place at 2 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old will appear before judges for a hearing where he will be informed of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed tens of thousands of people.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's stunning arrest in Manila came amid a spectacular meltdown in relations between his family and the Marcos family, who had previously joined forces to run the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice-President Sara Duterte - Rodrigo's daughter - are at loggerheads, with the latter facing an impeachment trial over charges including an alleged assassination plot against Marcos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara Duterte is in The Netherlands to support her father, after labelling his arrest "oppression and persecution", with the Duterte family having sought an emergency injunction from the Supreme Court to stop his transfer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The high-profile Duterte case also comes at a critical moment for the ICC, as it faces unprecedented pressure from all sides, including US sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over what he said were "illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war. (AFP)

    Trump threatens tariffs on EU alcohol

<img alt="President Trump's tariff threat could hit a market worth US$10 billion to EU producers in 2023, according to World Trade Organization figures. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795656_1_20250314055609.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, cognac, and other alcohol imports from Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's threat came in response to a European Union plan to impose tariffs on American whisky and other products next month - which itself is a response to Trump's 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports that took effect on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission had no immediate comment on Trump's post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada, a neighbour and close ally that is the US's biggest aluminium provider, has also announced countermeasures of its own to Trump's metals tariffs and has taken the dispute to the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte later on Thursday, he said he would not back off from reciprocal tariffs he has vowed to impose on all trading partners on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been ripped off for years, and we're not going to be ripped off," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol is shaping up to be a key friction point in the brewing trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the EU's proposed countermeasures, worth US$28.31 billion in all, would apply to products that have little more than symbolic value, such as dental floss and bathrobes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the proposed 50 percent duty on US bourbon would be a significant hit for the industry, which has seen exports grow steadily since the United States lifted tariffs Trump imposed during his first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU accounted for roughly 40 percent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Likewise, the United States accounts for 31 percent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry officials on both sides of the Atlantic urged their leaders to de-escalate. "This cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation must end now!" said spiritsEurope, an industry trade group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump says tariffs are a crucial tool to revitalise US industries that have withered due to decades of globalisation. But US importers and distributors said it would lead to lost sales, layoffs, and shuttered businesses. (Reuters)

<img alt="Before trading began, Washington unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday on a fresh wave of tariff threats by US President Donald Trump, and despite producer inflation remaining flat.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 percent to 40,813, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.4 percent to 5,521.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost nearly two percent to 17,303.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P drop means the index has tumbled into a correction, or down 10 percent from its highest point of the year, recorded just last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before trading began, Trump unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  His threat came after the EU announced a series of countermeasures against new US steel and aluminum tariffs, including a sharp hike targeting US whiskey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would make good on his threat if the bloc's planned whiskey levy "is not removed immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, government data also showed that the producer price index was flat in February, after a 0.6 percent rise in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's pretty good news in terms of inflation but the problem is, you have a trade war that's expanding," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  While recent inflation reports have been encouraging, Cardillo added that markets are wary as the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, alongside Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on the economy. (AFP)

    Pro-Palestinian protesters fill NY's Trump Tower

<img alt="Police officers detain a protester inside Trump Tower during a rally against the ICE detention of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795650_1_20250314053853.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scores of people poured into the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to protest the arrest and detention of Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, whom the Trump administration aims to deport over his pro-Palestinian activism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The arrest of Khalil, who is in immigration custody in Louisiana after his arrest in New York on Saturday, has sparked an outcry by Democratic lawmakers, the United Nations special rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian territories, and civil liberty advocates, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jewish Voice for Peace, which describes itself as a progressive Jewish anti-Zionist organisation, carried out Thursday's demonstration. The group said it was "taking over the Trump Tower to register our mass refusal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not stand by as this fascist regime attempts to criminalise Palestinians and all those calling for an end to the Israeli government’s US-funded genocide of the Palestinian people," the group said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Tower, located on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, is home to the Trump Organisation and where President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump own a penthouse apartment. Their son, Barron, has been living there since beginning his freshman year at New York University in the fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 150 protesters gathered at Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the New York Police Department estimated. Images on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs saying: "FIGHT NAZIS NOT STUDENTS" and "FREE MAHMOUD FREE PALESTINE."
  <br>
  <br>
  Video showed police arresting some of the protesters. The NYPD said 98 arrests were made.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaz Daughtry, the deputy mayor for public safety, said on Fox News that there were no injuries and all the protesters had been removed from the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump Organisation did not immediately provide comment. By arresting Khalil on Saturday, the Trump administration began fulfilling its campaign promise to deport foreign-born activists who participated in the wave of protests on U.S. college campuses last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, has been a prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian student movement at Columbia, perhaps the most prominent of the dozens of U.S. universities where demonstrations erupted last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump branded Khalil a "Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student" on social media and has said his arrest is the first "of many to come." (Reuters)

    Putin agrees to ceasefire but raises 'questions'

<img alt="Putin makes his first comments on the plan, saying he's " for src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795644_1_20250314025202.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had "serious questions" about Washington's plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but Moscow was ready to discuss it with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putin made his first comments on the plan, which Ukraine agreed to on Tuesday at talks with the United States, saying he was "for" the proposed ceasefire, but "there are nuances," and he had "serious questions" about how it would work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin told reporters, "I think we need to talk to our American colleagues... Maybe have a phone call with President Trump and discuss this with him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has called for Russia to agree to a ceasefire without any conditions, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying on Tuesday, "That's what we want to know, if they're prepared to do it unconditionally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Putin's statement was "promising" but "not complete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've actually discussed many of the details of a final agreement." Now we're going to see if Russia is there, and, if not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After visiting a military headquarters in the Kursk region Wednesday, the Russian president hailed troops' progress against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Trump pushes for a speedy end to the more than three-year conflict, his envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Moscow Thursday to discuss the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has expressed optimism that his team can secure a ceasefire, despite Moscow's battlefield gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can get Russia to stop, then we have a full ceasefire. And I think it'll never go back to war," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier Thursday had criticised the lack of an official response from Moscow, saying on social media that this shows "Russia seeks to prolong the war and postpone peace for as long as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of talks, Putin said, "We agree with proposals to cease hostilities, but on the basis that cessation would lead to long-term peace and address the root causes of the crisis." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two primary schools will not receive grants from the Education Bureau to operate primary one classes in the coming academic year, because they failed to enrol the minimum 16 pupils required to form a class.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are Price Memorial Catholic Primary School in Wong Tai Sin and Aplichau Kaifong Primary School in Southern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau sent a letter to all government and subsidised primary schools on Thursday regarding the approval of classes and manpower planning for the 2025-26 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said if schools have any comments over the proposed class structure, they can submit feedback by March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau noted schools that don't receive grants can still request to run primary one classes with private funds, merge with other schools or close altogether.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said such schools can join the Primary One allocation a year later with special approval from the bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau added that no schools that faced bans on enrolling primary one students over the past six years are facing the same issue again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Angus Ng was sent packing at the All England Open in Birmingham, losing to Singapore's Loh Kean Yew in straight games in the round of 16 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng came off an impressive victory over Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, coming from a game down in the last 32 to advance 19-21, 21-16, 21-12.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the SAR shuttler once again struggled against Loh, having lost all four of their previous encounters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng conceded the opening game 15-21, before falling 4-10 behind in game two. The Hong Kong representative stormed back to level things up at 14-all, but eventually succumbed to a 17-21 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loh will next face China's world number one, Shi Yuqi, who beat Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-19. Shi is the favourite in Birmingham following Victor Axelsen's surprise exit earlier on Thursday.

    Civil service job cuts won't save much: Legco

<img alt="The Legislative Council Secretariat says civil service job cuts may not save much money. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795601_1_20250313190933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to cut 10,000 civil service positions over two years may not translate into substantial manpower savings, according to a research brief released by the Legislative Council Secretariat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the report, the size of the civil service establishment exceeded the actual number of workers employed by 18,900 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coupled with a vacancy rate in civil service of around 10 percent right now, most of the 10,000 posts would not have been filled anyway, with or without the post deletion policy," the report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also examined the civil service pay freeze for the upcoming fiscal year. They projected potential savings of HK$8.7 billion, assuming a 3 percent market wage increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparing Hong Kong with other advanced economies in the Asia-Pacific region, the brief noted that civil servants made up 4.7 percent of the local workforce in 2023, higher than Singapore's 3.7 percent, and 4.2 percent for South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also concluded the HK$2 fare concessionary scheme for the elderly remains competitive, even after putting a cap on the number of trips and changing the formula for long-haul journeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  It compared the measure to similar schemes in 12 other cities worldwide, and noted only London, Paris, Guangzhou and Singapore offer concessionary fares for commuters between 60 and 64.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the secretariat conceded the proposed tweaks will bring insignificant relief to public coffers, estimating savings of only HK$680 million each year.

    'No cryopreservation time limit helps the infertile'

<img alt="An expert has expressed doubts on whether the proposed amendments on cryopreservation can help lift Hong Kong's declining birth rate. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795595_1_20250313182427.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A population expert on Thursday welcomed the government's proposed amendments to lift the storage period limits for frozen gametes and embryos, saying it would be helpful for those who are infertile.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Paul Yip from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Social Work and Social Administration said the plan would ease concerns of people who have difficulty conceiving, but he expressed doubts over whether the plan will help lift the city's declining birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those people who [have] gone through these exercises, we are not expecting to have a lot of people, and it is also quite expensive. So if we bet on…this measure [to] increase the total number of births substantially, I think it's a bit over-optimistic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that the proposal is not a "panacea" to tackle the birth rate issue, and called on people who wish to have children to do so earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Nixie Lam pointed out that the proposal marks a pivotal moment in the city's approach to reproductive healthcare.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believes the move can help boost the success rate for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the pressure to use stored eggs within a decade often leads to a rush and costly treatment," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With an indefinite storage period, patients can take their time and potentially lead to a higher success rate and fewer IVF cycles needed."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the proposed amendments will allow people to conduct family planning on their own terms.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An upcoming exhibition dedicated to Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is set to bring a vibrant intercultural and intergenerational experience to Hong Kong as part of this year's French May Arts Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Picasso for Asia - A Conversation," the exhibition showcases over 60 of the maestro's masterpieces, alongside around 130 works from 30 Asian artists, including four from Hong Kong, who wish to pay tribute to or be linked with his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are connections that are clear expressions of admiration or homage when certain painters, very preeminent painters from our part of the world, paint images of Picasso based on photographs. I think that's a clear and active homage," said Doryun Chong, artistic director and chief curator at M+ museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But then we can also have more indirect conversations that can be sometimes commentary, tongue-in-cheek commentary, but then it can also be a subtle critique because Picasso was from a different time, and then society and our understanding of art's role and gender dynamics have changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By putting the more recent artworks by contemporary Asian artists next to Picasso's, we can also see continued relevance as well as passage of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong also said the exhibition marks the first major showcase of Picasso's masterpieces here in over a decade, so he hopes visitors will get to see the late artist in a new way, despite how much they know about his legacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's as much about revealing Picasso as putting a lot of questions around the myth surrounding Picasso. I really hope that our audiences will also see in new light art that is made more recently from our part of the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kinds of art that they would feel more familiar with because they're from here, but by being next to Picasso, I hope that they will also see something new about modern and contemporary art from our part of the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The exhibition will be open to the public at the M+ West Gallery from March 15 to July 13.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government launched on Thursday a consultation on lifting the storage period limitation for frozen eggs, sperm or embryos.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, people can store their gametes or embryos for up to 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cancer patients or people who are infertile because of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or other medical treatments can have their gametes stored for 10 years or until they are 55 years old, whichever is longer, while the storage period for embryos is 10 years at the most.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Council on Human Reproductive Technology is proposing to amend the existing code of practice on reproductive technology and embryo research to allow them to arrange storage for as long as they want.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council said it "will amend the operational measures in the code accordingly to ensure that the public is fully aware of the associated medical risks before engaging in unnecessary and prolonged storage of gametes or embryos without medical reasons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It also suggested that licensed centres must inform patients on the risks of egg-retrieval procedures, rapid decline in fertility or pregnancy rate associated with ageing of women, the risks of geriatric pregnancy, as well as the social impacts of delayed childbearing. Patients must sign a consent form of acknowledgement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centres also have to provide counselling based on individual circumstances and seek written consent before extending the storage period.
  <br>
  <br>
  And they will need to provide statistical data to authorities for regulatory purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council is seeking opinions from stakeholders, including licensed centres and organisations, on the proposed changes until April 13.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver, who was behind the wheel of a light goods vehicle travelling along the West Kowloon Highway on Thursday, died after crashing into a fire engine in Tai Kok Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fatal accident occurred at about 2pm, near Olympian City.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver had initially been stuck in the van, which was severely damaged, before being brought to Kwong Wah Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating online showed that there was also a white dump truck near the site of the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media reports said the dump truck had earlier crashed into safety barriers along the road after a bird hit the vehicle's windshield.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added the light van crashed into the fire engine which was responding to the dump truck driver's call for assistance.

    China urges diplomatic Iran nuclear solution

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China called on Thursday for a "diplomatic" resolution to the Iran nuclear issue as it prepared to host diplomats from Tehran and Moscow for talks in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the current situation, we believe that all parties should maintain calm and restraint to avoid escalating the Iran nuclear situation, or even walking towards confrontation and conflict," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will be attended by Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from a landmark deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief during President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the 2015 deal for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said the upcoming talks would aim to "strengthen communication and coordination, to resume dialogue and negotiation at an early time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China sincerely hopes that all parties can work together, continuously increase mutual trust and dispel misgivings, and turn the momentum of restarting dialogue and negotiation into reality at an early date," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing has called for "dialogue" with Washington to resolve spiralling trade tensions that have seen the world's two largest economies impose a number of tariffs on each other's imports in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States and China will work together... to return to the correct track of resolving issues through dialogue and consultation," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian at a news conference. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Ombudsman on Thursday urged the Housing Department to step up efforts to tackle illegal parking in public housing estates.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog’s call to action comes after it inspected four estates that do not have vehicle gates installed at all entrances because of geographical constraints.
  <br>
  <br>
  These are Yau Oi Estate, Cheung Hong Estate, Lai Yiu Estate and Queen's Hill Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog said inspectors had found cases of long-term illegal parking in three of the estates apart from Yau Oi Estate, adding that some vehicles are even blocking emergency vehicle access in Lai Yiu Estate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the situation of illegal parking in Yau Oi Estate has improved after the department implemented enhancement measures, including the installation of an additional CCTV system, as well as the deployment of more patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As the case of Yau Oi Estate has shown, strengthening enforcement is indeed conducive to alleviating illegal parking. Overall, we urge the Housing Department to improve its handling of parking violations, especially to step up combating illegal parking along emergency vehicular access to minimise potential safety hazards,” Ombudsman Jack Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog asked the department to step up enforcement against illegal parking blackspots, and to take immediate enforcement action against cars blocking emergency vehicle access.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged the department to set up key performance indicators for security service contractors, as well as to work more closely with the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the Housing Department said it accepts the Ombudsman's suggestions, and promised to improve existing measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it will work with other government departments to conduct joint operations to resolve the issue.

 The bodies of at least 25 people, including 21 hostages, killed in a train siege by separatist gunmen in Pakistan were retrieved from the site yesterday ahead of the first funerals, officials said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security forces said they freed more than 340 passengers in a two-day rescue operation that ended late on Wednesday after a separatist group bombed a remote track in mountainous southwest Balochistan and stormed a train with around 450 passengers on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assault was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army, one of a number of separatist groups that accuse outsiders of plundering natural resources in Balochistan near the borders with Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Death tolls have varied, with the military saying that "21 innocent hostages" were killed as well as four soldiers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A railway official said the bodies of the 25 people were transported by train away from the site of the siege to the nearby town of Mach on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deceased were identified as 19 military passengers, one police and one railway official, while four bodies are yet to be identified," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers who escaped said after walking for hours through rugged mountains to reach safety that they saw people being shot dead by militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first funerals are expected to take place on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was also expected to visit Balochistan, his office said. (AFP)

<img alt="HKU’s dentistry course sits at the number-two spot when compared with its global peers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795543_1_20250313124205.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 70 percent of local university courses have seen their global rankings rise, compared to last year’s results.
 <br>
  <br>
  UK-based higher education analytics firm QS announced on Thursday that among them, six courses offered by two universities in the SAR have been listed in the global top 10 in their respective fields, two more compared with the results in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them is the University of Hong Kong’s dentistry course, which sits at the number-two spot when compared with its global peers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The university's education course, meanwhile, rose to number three globally, and its linguistics and geography courses ranked ninth and tenth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese University’s nursing course rose to number five on the global table, with its linguistics course coming in at number 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than HKU and CUHK, seven courses from the Polytechnic University (PolyU) were ranked among the global top 30, while four courses from the City University (CityU) entered the global top 50 list.
  <br>
  <br>
  CityU's veterinary science, meanwhile, entered the global top 100 ranking for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, QS highlighted that the city is one of the top higher education centres in the world for data science and artificial intelligence, as five universities that offer such subjects were ranked among the top 50.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it expressed concerns over the SAR’s decision to cut education funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This remarkable progress marks a strong resurgence, reaffirming Hong Kong’s position as a leading hub for academic excellence – though planned cuts to higher education funding raise concerns about the sector’s ability to maintain its current momentum and global competitiveness,” the firm said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the survey this year is the largest in terms of scale, involving over 175,000 academics and over 100,000 employers, and covering over 18,300 subjects at over 1,700 universities in the world.

    Cancer devices donated by Li require clinical trials

<img alt="HKU says 40 patients have been treated with the donated device over the past six months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795541_1_20250313123550.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials said medical devices donated by a tycoon for treating liver cancer are still under clinical trials and require careful evaluation before wider use in public healthcare.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the Li Ka Shing Foundation announced it would donate histotripsy machines for liver cancer treatment to the Chinese University and University of Hong Kong (HKU), as well as the Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of these devices will be relocated from HKU's medical school to Gleneagles Hospital to treat the private facility's patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint response, the Health Bureau, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority said they expect data from the clinical trials to provide scientific evidence for broader applications in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clinical trials should be distinguished from clinical services. No clinical service may be provided when a clinical trial is still unfinished," officials wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  When introducing new medical devices, the authority looks at safety and therapeutic effectiveness and the decisions are not influenced by whether treatments are provided or sponsored by manufacturers, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The application in the public healthcare system of new drugs and medical devices, and methods for treatment that are still in the clinical trial phase without sufficient clinical data, should be handled in a very careful and prudent manner," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donated devices have to be listed under the voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System to ensure medical devices meet safety and quality requirements, officials added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to RTHK inquiries, HKU said 40 patients have been treated over the past six months with the device it has been given and that it is still in the research phase.

    'Students may have contracted gastroenteritis in HK'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Society for Infectious Diseases on Thursday said it would "not be surprising" if some students might have already caught norovirus – which can cause gastroenteritis – before departing for an exchange trip on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 50 secondary students and teachers from three local schools who had eaten meals at the same restaurants on an exchange trip to Shaoguan, Guangdong, were reported to have contracted gastroenteritis on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio show, Dr Wilson Lam revealed that norovirus activity has significantly increased globally compared to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the virus can be spread if there is vomit present.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, if there's a confined space in school buses or coaches, if a student vomited, it can absolutely cause students nearby to be infected," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or by having contact with areas where the virus has landed can also result in indirect contact transmission."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that hand sanitisers are ineffective against norovirus, and advised the public to wash their hands with soap instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Subsidised Secondary Schools Council chairman Lee Yi-ying revealed to the same programme that travel agencies will not allow schools to postpone tours if they suspect there may be infectious diseases at the destination.
  <br>
  <br>
  But schools can talk to agencies about visiting different attractions or restaurants, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that if a student feels unwell, teachers will take them to the doctor after they obtain their parents' consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Tang Fei told the same show that there are sufficient guidelines for schools to follow during study tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, at least one participating staff should have a first aid licence, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schools should activate the crisis management mechanism if they encounter similar cases, he added.

<img alt="Tan Lip Bu rejoins Intel as chief executive on Tuesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795538_1_20250313134923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Tan Lip Bu as the latest in a succession of chief executives to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job on Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous head, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.
  <br>
  <br>
  This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down in August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lip Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” interim executive chairman Frank Yeary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60 percent, wiping out US$160 billion in shareholder wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees — about 15 percent of its workforce — and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of US$19 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvida now boasts a market value of US$2.8 trillion compared to Intel's US$90 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel's stock price rose more than 10 percent in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military investigators charged two air force pilots on Thursday with criminal negligence over an accidental bombing of a village last week during a training exercise, which injured at least 29 people and caused extensive property damage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry investigators have confirmed that errors by the pilots when they entered coordinates into the aircraft systems were "direct factors" behind the accidental bombing, the ministry's Criminal Investigation Command said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots were charged with criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the command said, adding the investigation of the incident is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight unguided air-to-surface bombs were launched from two fighter jets and landed on a village in Pocheon near the border with North Korea during live-fire exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several areas in Pocheon and neighbouring regions have training grounds used by the South Korean and US militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents have for years complained about potential safety risks and disturbances from military units being mobilised in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two pilots have been taken off flight duties and a review of their flight mission certification has been scheduled, a ministry official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The air force chief of staff has apologised for the accident and pledged to review mission procedures to prevent similar incidents. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau health authorities on Thursday said that a two-year-old girl from the SAR who was seriously injured in a shopping mall blast in Taichung has died.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspected gas explosion on February 13 hit the food court of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, killing four on the spot and injuring about 30 others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau government announcement, made in the early hours of Thursday, noted that the girl had died on March 7, with authorities expressing deep sorrow over her passing and extending condolences to her family.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-year-old girl had been flown back to Macau on February 26. She was then brought directly to the Conde S Januario Hospital, where she was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said officials will provide psychological support and counselling to the girl’s family.

 A US judge on Wednesday extended his order blocking federal authorities from deporting a detained Columbia University student, in a case that has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's pledge to deport some pro-Palestinian college activists.
 <br>
  <br>
  US District Judge Jesse Furman had temporarily blocked Mahmoud Khalil's deportation earlier this week, and extended the prohibition on Wednesday in a written order following a hearing in Manhattan federal court to allow himself more time to consider whether the arrest was unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Homeland Security says Khalil is subject to deportation under a legal provision holding that migrants whose presence in the country are deemed by the US Secretary of State to be incompatible with foreign policy may be removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Secretary of State has determined that your presence or activities in the United States would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States," read the DHS document, dated March 9, ordering Khalil to appear before an immigration judge on March 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document did not provide additional detail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHS did not immediately responded to requests for comment from reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khalil's lawyers say his arrest on Saturday by DHS agents outside his university residence in Manhattan was in retaliation for his outspoken advocacy against Israel's assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack, and thus violated Khalil's right to free speech under the US Constitution's First Amendment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr. Khalil was identified, targeted, detained and is being processed for deportation on account of his advocacy for Palestinian rights," Khalil's lawyer Ramzi Kassem said in court. (Reuters)

<img alt="Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was the star for Oklahoma City yet again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795528_1_20250313112112.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder punched their ticket to the playoffs with an impressive 118-112 victory over the reigning champion Boston Celtics in a potential NBA Finals sneak preview.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander enhanced his credentials as favourite for the Most Valuable Player award with a superb performance to silence Boston's TD Garden home crowd in an absorbing duel settled by a burst of fourth-quarter Thunder scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian point guard shot 11-of-20 from the field to finish with five rebounds, seven assists and 34 points, including 10-of-11 from the free throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City to 54-12, and guaranteed their place in next month's playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's win over a vastly more experienced Boston line-up marked another mature display from a Thunder side that is the youngest in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City effectively sealed victory late in the fourth, pulling away to open up a double-digit lead with just under two minutes remaining after Cason Wallace nailed a superb 24-foot three-pointer followed by a driving reverse layup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander said the Thunder's defensive solidity amid a barrage of 63 attempted threes from Boston had provided the foundation for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops, and that's been the trend for us recently," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're coming down the stretch against a good basketball team with good players, you've got to find a way, and we did so tonight and gave ourselves a chance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Gilgeous-Alexander grabbed the scoring headlines, the towering Chet Holmgren caught the eye with a double-double of 23 points with 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all the know the player Chet Holmgren is," Gilgeous-Alexander said of his 22-year-old team-mate. "He's a stud, and he's going to be stud for a very long time. He'll continue to grow and continue to be special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City's balanced offense meanwhile suggests that they are well-equipped to make a deep run in the postseason as they pursue the franchise's first NBA title since 1979, when the club were the Seattle SuperSonics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite missing Jaylin Williams from the line-up, the Thunder finished with seven players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston's scoring was led by Jayson Tatum with 33 points, while Derrick White had 22. Jaylen Brown though had an off-night, shooting 5-of-15 from the field before fouling out in the fourth quarter with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his team had failed to deal with Oklahoma City's physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of moments where we matched that and there were a few where we didn't, and I think stuff like that's the difference in the game," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795510_1_20250313085050.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was turned over on Wednesday to the custody of the International Criminal Court, following his arrest on a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 79-year-old former president arrived at Rotterdam The Hague Airport in the Netherlands earlier on Wednesday on a flight from Manila, following his arrest there on an ICC request on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and families of victims hailed Duterte’s arrest, and the court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, called it “a crucial step in our continuous work to ensure accountability for the victims of the most serious crimes under ICC jurisdiction.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Duterte criticised the administration of current Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Duterte's political rival, for arresting and surrendering the former leader to a court whose jurisdiction his supporters dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch-based court said in a statement that medical assistance was made available "as a precautionary measure'' at the airport for Duterte, in line with standard procedures when a suspect arrives. The court did not comment on his state of health.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance drove to the hangar where his plane was taken, and medics wheeled a gurney inside.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police helicopter hovered close to the airport, and later a black SUV was seen leaving the airport accompanied by police. Its destination was not immediately clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within days, Duterte will face an initial appearance where the court will confirm his identity, check that he understands the charges against him and set a date for a hearing to assess if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to send him to a full trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Duterte could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (AP)

    Nasa launches SPHEREx to study universe's origin

<img alt="The megaphone-shaped telescope will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way during its planned two-year mission. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795461_1_20250312212209.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Nasa telescope was launched into space from California on Tuesday for a mission to explore the origins of the universe and to search the Milky Way galaxy for hidden reservoirs of water, a key ingredient for life.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US space agency's megaphone-shaped SPHEREx – short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer – was carried aloft by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its planned two-year mission, the observatory will collect data on more than 450 million galaxies, as well as more than 100 million stars in the Milky Way. It will create a three-dimensional map of the cosmos in 102 colors – individual wavelengths of light – and will study the history and evolution of galaxies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission aims to deepen the understanding of a phenomenon known as cosmic inflation, referring to the universe's rapid and exponential expansion from a single point in a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that occurred roughly 13.8 billion years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SPHEREx is really trying to get at the origins of the universe – what happened in those very few first instants after the Big Bang," SPHEREx instrument scientist Phil Korngut of Caltech said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reigning theory that describes this is called inflation. As its name posits, it proposes that the universe underwent an enormous expansion, going from smaller than the size of an atom, expanding a trillion-trillion fold in just a tiny fraction of a second," Korngut said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at Nasa headquarters, said SPHEREx is going to search for "reverberations from the Big Bang – the fractions of a second after the Big Bang that echoed into the areas SPHEREx is going to directly observe."
  <br>
  <br>
  SPHEREx will take pictures in every direction around Earth, splitting the light from billions of cosmic sources such as stars and galaxies into their component wavelengths to determine their composition and distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Within our galaxy, SPHEREx will search for reservoirs of water frozen on the surface of interstellar dust grains in large clouds of gas and dust that give rise to stars and planets.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will look for water and molecules including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide frozen on the surface of dust grains in molecular clouds, which are dense regions of gas and dust in interstellar space. Scientists believe that reservoirs of ice bound to dust grains in these clouds are where most of the universe's water forms and dwells. (Reuters)

 Former badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen suffered a shock first-round defeat to Chinese Taipei's Lin Chun-yi at the All England Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lin came out of top after a back-and-forth first game before Axelsen dominated the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane was not able to keep that form in the decider, however, as Lin reeled off six points in a row on the way to a 21-19, 13-21, 21-11 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I don't play my best, everyone can win against me," said Axelsen, the current world number four. "Today's opponent played a fantastic game, it was disappointing but that is how it is."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just tried to survive in the match," he added. "There is always a lot of pressure when I am here at the All England and every single day, and I got tense when my body was feeling bad and it affected my entire game."

<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming of US astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.
 <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad, officials said on a livestream of the launch countdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when the next launch opportunity would be. The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and Nasa could try to launch again in the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams - stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner. The US space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than Nasa had planned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and US Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX's rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral at 7.48 pm ET (2348 GMT) with a crew of two US astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station's other astronauts and have remained safe, according to Nasa. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us," Williams said of her family. "We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun." The flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought - without offering evidence - to blame former President Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.

  The demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in Nasa's human spaceflight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but Nasa swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.

  When the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others - Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.

  Wilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives in order to keep the ISS staffed with enough US astronauts for maintenance, according to Nasa.

  Wilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. Nasa deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.

  Boeing built Starliner under a US$4.5 billion contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. Last year's mission had marked Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.

  Starliner's development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar Nasa contract worth at least US$4 billion. (Reuters)
