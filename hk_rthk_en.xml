<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Beijing on Tuesday to attend the annual opening meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The NPC meeting will open in the capital on Wednesday, while the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong on Thursday, and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will be the acting CE during his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Executive Council will not hold meetings these two weeks as local NPC and CPPCC members will need to attend the meetings in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport on Monday, a number of local NPC deputies expressed hope for policies supporting private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that in the government work report, there will also be supporting measures to encourage more private enterprises from Hong Kong and around the world to invest in our country," said Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Iris Wong said she was upbeat about the country's potential in tech and cultural industries despite Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone can see that whether it's DeepSeek or the development of robotics, and even the recently popular Nezha movie, these are all achievements of our innovation, culture and technology," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member and Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said he would continue to push for more Greater Bay Area residents to visit Hong Kong, including expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to eight more cities in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate and lawmaker Johnny Ng, meanwhile, said he would propose mechanisms for fraud prevention education during the meetings in the capital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's largest bubble tea and drinks chain Mixue Group jumped nearly 30 per cent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday after the firm raised HK$444 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
 <br>
  <br>
  Mixue sold 17 million shares in the deal at a fixed price of HK$202.50 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shares started trading at HK$262 each and the gains outpaced a 0.8 per cent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail investors subscribed for 5,258 times more shares than were on offer in that tranche, according to Mixue's filings, making it one of Hong Kong's most popular ever IPOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail subscription rate was just below Bloks Group whose retail book was 6,000 times oversubscribed, a record, in its January IPO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institutional tranche of the deal was 35 times covered, the filings showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixue is often seen as China's largest chain of iced drinks, milk tea, and ice cream. However, it operates more like a raw-material supplier than a traditional beverage brand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1997 as a small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Mixue has grown into a franchise giant with over 45,000 stores globally by September 2024, surpassing Starbucks' 40,576 stores worldwide. (Reuters)

    Israel blocks humanitarian aid into Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel on Sunday blocked aid flowing into Gaza, where a six-week truce enabled the entry of vital food, shelter and medical assistance, prompting the UN to call for an immediate restoration of humanitarian assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli decision came as talks on a truce extension appeared to hit an impasse, after the ceasefire's 42-day first phase drew to a close.
  <br>
  <br>
  Truce mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, Israel had announced a truce extension until mid-April that it said United States Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favouring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  With uncertainty looming over the truce, both Israel and Palestinian sources reported Israeli military strikes in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, whose health ministry reported at least four people killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the fighting, said the "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the [ceasefire] agreement".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as "a weapon against the Palestinian people", comments echoed by Qatar which said it "strongly condemns" Israel's decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which has rejected any talk of normalising ties with Israel without a Palestinian state, condemned the aid block as "a tool of blackmail and collective punishment".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan said Israel's action "threatens to reignite" fighting in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN chief Antonio Guterres called for "humanitarian aid to flow back into Gaza immediately".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union condemned what it called Hamas's refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block "risked humanitarian consequences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels called for "a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers erased an 18-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 133-129 in an NBA overtime thriller, boosting their league-best record with a 10th straight victory as Boston beat Denver in a clash of the past two champions.
 <br>
  <br>
  De'Andre Hunter, getting a starting nod as Cavs star Donovan Mitchell rested, scored 18 of his game-high 32 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as Cleveland poured it on late to grab their 50th win of the season against 10 defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made open shots, tried to get to the rim and get fouled," Hunter said of his late-game heroics, which saw him give Cleveland the lead for good with a three-pointer that put them up 131-129 with 30.8 seconds remaining in overtime
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter, acquired from Atlanta at the trade deadline, then came up with a steal and grabbed a rebound when Portland's Deni Avdija missed a three-pointer. Finally Hunter drilled a pair of free-throws to seal the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ty Jerome scored 25 points off the bench for Cleveland as six Cavs players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avdija led Portland with 30 points and added 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his first career triple-double. Anfernee Simons scored 27 points for the Blazers, who led most of the first half in pursuit of a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cleveland edged ahead 42-39 on Darius Garland's jump shot, Portland closed the first half on a 15-0 scoring run that sent them into the locker room leading 54-42.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs pulled level at 101-101 with just under five minutes left in the fourth quarter, and they traded the lead three more times before Simons made a pair of free-throws that tied it at 119-119 to send it to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're a resilient group," said Jerome, admitting the Cavs' come-from-behind win over the Celtics in Boston on Friday had taken it out of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's a good team," he added of the Blazers. "We just had to stay with it and make some shots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Boston, the Celtics let a big lead get away before holding off the Nuggets 110-103.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown scored 22 points and handed out eight assists to leading the reigning champion Celtics, who led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter only for Denver to pull within three points in the waning minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray scored 13 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to key the comeback, his driving layup off a rebound of a Brown miss pulling the Nuggets within 102-99 with 1:15 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBA Most valuable Player Nikola Jokic scored 20 points with 14 rebounds and nine assists for the 2023 champion Nuggets, but the Celtics came up with the shots when they needed them to snap a two-game skid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Al Horford finished with 19 points, Derrick White added 17 and Jayson Tatum had a relatively modest 16 with 11 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively, I thought we were good tonight," Brown said. "Offensively we missed some good looks.I missed some layups, I missed some open shots, but we were able to hang on." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian share markets dithered on Monday as the threat of imminent tariffs lurked in the background, while bitcoin surged on news it would be included in a new US strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump on social media announced five digital assets he expected to include in a new reserve, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, shot up more than 11 per cent to US$94,110, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed 14 per cent to US$2,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 per cent, helped by a softer yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.1 per cent, having staged a late rally on Friday after a week of heavy losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25 per cent level.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 10 per cent levy on Chinese imports is also due to come into effect this week, just as the National People's Congress opens its third annual session on Wednesday. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders closed ranks on Sunday in support of Kyiv at a London summit, where they pledged to spend more on security and assemble a coalition to defend any truce in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  And French President Emmanuel Macron, flying back from the summit, said in a newspaper interview that France and Britain wanted to propose a partial one-month truce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks, which brought together 18 allies, came just two days after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in front of reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Britain, France "and others" would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, which they would then put to Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London meeting came at a delicate moment for war-battered Ukraine, facing uncertain US backing and on the back foot against Russia's three-year war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's row with Zelensky also raised fresh questions over the US commitment to Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Europe found itself "at a crossroads in history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a moment for more talk - it's time to act. It's time to step up and lead and unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  With no guarantee of US involvement, "Europe must do the heavy lifting", Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several countries were ready to help defend any truce, he added - without naming them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron, in an interview with France's Le Figaro newspaper, said he and Starmer were working on a one-month truce in Ukraine, "in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was warmly embraced by many of the world leaders at the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the UK leader's Downing Street home, people gathered to show their support for Ukraine, some dressed in the country's blue and yellow national colours. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates attending the "Two Sessions" meetings this year said they're looking to make a range of proposals – on the development of artificial intelligence and a low-altitude economy, among other things – as the SAR seeks to further integrate into the nation's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be joining the country's largest annual political gatherings in Beijing this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker and local CPPCC member, Johnny Ng, told RTHK that he expects Beijing to put forward initiatives on technology – especially AI – in light of the emergence of DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays we have DeepSeek, this is open source. Open source means different industries can leverage AI to improve their efficiency, like the healthcare industry, the legal industry, the education industry," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I expect and I suggest the government to make a clearer blueprint to every different industry to leverage the benefits of AI... The government should have a clear blueprint and make some funding support."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects cybersecurity to be a key concern for policymakers amid the country's technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker and CPPCC delegate, William Wong, called for the development of a cross-border low-altitude economy, which he sees as key to boosting cooperation in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the development of a low-altitude economy is generally considered more mature on the mainland than in the SAR, Wong believes Hong Kong can play a significant role moving forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The research part can actually be done in Hong Kong, and then the sort of prototyping, the testing part can be done in Shenzhen, for example, because one project is split between two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So during the research and development process, there will be a lot of, for example, document transfer. There may be experimental samples transfer or even equipment transfer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stronger cross-border cooperation could also be on the cards when it comes to biotech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, said the Hetao zone is a major technology hub for the SAR, and the city should make good use of it and step up cooperation with the mainland, to help boost the country's overall biotech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member said the mainland could send its blood products to Hong Kong, so the SAR can capitalise on its advantage in medical research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financing for businesses is another key topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local NPC deputy, Ronick Chan, said many mainland enterprises, especially those in Qianhai, want to tap the Hong Kong loan market, but it's difficult for them to do so right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wants to expand the loan quotas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put in place a total quota in respect of how the Qianhai enterprises could borrow from Hong Kong's financial institutions, and also Hong Kong's companies and enterprises could also borrow from Qianhai's financial institutions. This kind of liberation, I expect, could accelerate the cross-border fund flow and also be beneficial to Hong Kong's loan growth," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other delegates at the "Two Sessions" said they'd like to see more support for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Stanley Ng wants more mainland tourists to be able to visit Hong Kong via the multi-entry visa scheme, which only covers Shenzhen residents at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the scheme will cover residents in Guangzhou before expanding further to other cities in the Greater Bay Area in future.

    'Kai Tak Stadium makes Hong Kong a hot destination'

<img alt="Lawmaker Adrian Ho says Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park went smoothly. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793928_1_20250303081026.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker on Monday said the Kai Tak Stadium places Hong Kong on the map as a "hot destination" for major concerts and events, after the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opened over the weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Adrian Ho was among the tens of thousands of people who attended the ceremony, where spectators, were treated to a dazzling performance featuring athletes and celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said organisers of major events will now take notice of Hong Kong's brand new facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really never had a sort of internationally up-to-standard arena until right now. So I believe that we would be a very hot destination to host events not only just locally, but internationally too," the New People's Party member told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the size of the stadium is a draw, adding that international stars prefer to perform at newer facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Almost all organisers prefer sort of newer arenas. So I mean, this is the newest and hottest arena...If you look at events around the world everybody wants to go to a newer arena because of more state-of-the-art technology, technological advancements in terms of equipment, infrastructure, it's newer, it's better, so to speak, so I think for that matter...we're at an advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker also said Saturday's opening ceremony for the Kai Tak Sports Park -- which featured a fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau -- went smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a huge event, and I think all of the expectations that I had prior to the event in terms of security, arrangements, the audience, as well as the programme, pretty much met my expectations," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was great."

    Man Utd crash out of FA Cup as Fulham win shoot-out

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United's dismal season hit a new low as the FA Cup holders crashed out after a 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat against Fulham in the fifth round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's side trailed to Calvin Bassey's first-half opener at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised to force a 1-1 draw after extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham keeper Bernd Leno was the hero in the shoot-out as he saved from Victor Lindelof and Joshua Zirkzee, with the visitors converting all four of their kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booed off at half-time, it was another wretched result for United in a season that sees them languishing in 14th place in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13-time FA Cup winners had reached the final for the last two seasons and beat Manchester City to lift the trophy last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be no trip to Wembley this season for United, who have only the Europa League left as a silverware chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard. We had the best chances in the game but in the end the penalties can go both ways and today it was not our day," Amorim said. "I know that we are losing games and losing trophies during this season but the goal is to win the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how long it's going to take," he added. "But if you think like that, we can suffer a little bit in these defeats."
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been another testing week at Old Trafford, with 200 job cuts announced and United struggling to draw with Everton and barely beat lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim admitted that life is "hard" just now for United and this was the latest hammer blow to the under-fire Portuguese coach, who only arrived in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head to Real Sociedad for the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday before hosting Arsenal in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Amorim to realise United were in for another dispiriting afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund fired over from an acute angle after Christian Eriksen's cross found the much-maligned United striker, whose goalless drought has now reached 18 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eriksen's curler was fisted away by Leno, but that did little to satisfy fans frustrated by years of underachievement. (AFP)

<img alt="Relatives mourn two Palestinians killed in a reported Israeli strike in the northern Gaza Strip, as a truce hangs in the balance. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793904_1_20250302212847.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ministry of health in Hamas-run Gaza said four people were killed and six others wounded in Israeli attacks on Sunday after the first phase of a fragile truce in the territory drew to a close.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Since this morning, four dead and six wounded" have been brought to "hospitals in the Gaza Strip following Israeli attacks in various parts of the territory", the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said that it struck suspects planting an "explosive device" in northern Gaza as the first phase of a fragile ceasefire with Hamas ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel and Hamas to maintain their ceasefire in Gaza to prevent the conflict-weary region from sinking back into despair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire agreement has saved countless lives and offered a beacon of hope amid unimaginable suffering. Any unravelling of the forward momentum created over the last six weeks risks plunging people back into despair," it said in a statement, adding the truce was "essential."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came as Israel said it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza and as deadly attacks were reported in the territory after Israel and Hamas hit an impasse of how to proceed further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged on Sunday the "full implementation" of the Gaza ceasefire deal, calling on the European Union to pressure Israel to enforce it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no alternative to the faithful and full implementation by all parties of what was signed last January," Abdelatty said at a press conference in Cairo, urging the EU to exert "maximum pressure on the parties, especially the Israeli party, regarding commitment to the ceasefire agreement". (AFP)

    Ailing Pope hails faithful's 'support' and 'affection'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for more than two weeks with double pneumonia, on Sunday thanked believers around the world for their "support" and "affection" as he missed delivering a third straight Angelus prayer in person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been treated at the Gemelli hospital in Rome since February 14, missed the traditional weekly prayer, which instead was published in the form of a letter the Vatican released at noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the prayers, which rise up to the Lord from the hearts of so many faithful from many parts of the world. I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am 'carried' and supported by all God's people. Thank you all," wrote the Argentine pontiff.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by calling for peace in addressing conflicts around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I pray above all for peace. From here, war appears even more absurd. Let us pray for tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and Kivu," the pope wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Vatican, the pope spent "a calm night".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pope is still resting," the Holy See said earlier in its latest health update on the head of the Catholic Church.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, it had said the pope's condition was "stable", adding that he was still receiving oxygen, had no fever, had been eating, was alert and praying. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local delegate to the country’s top advisory body plans to ask for measures on facilitating people flow within the Greater Bay Area, during the upcoming “Two Sessions” meetings in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tang, who is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member, came up with a number of proposals on better integrating Hong Kong into the country’s development and the Greater Bay Area, as well as leveraging the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former chief secretary hoped the central government would expand the multiple-entry visa scheme currently in place for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one “new concept”, as he put it, would be on enriching the financial system on a closed-loop basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like I’m proposing to open up a giant back door to undermine the currency controls of the country, but to allow the people in the Greater Bay Area to take much better advantage of the financial instruments available in Hong Kong that are otherwise unavailable to the Shenzhen residents,” he said in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang said the latest budget blueprint unveiled by the SAR government had focused on stability, calling it “commendable and reasonable”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you look at it from three basic principles — first is stability, second is development, and third is investing for future — they have all three parts in it,” said Tang, who formerly served as financial secretary himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Generally, it is an acceptable budget, in that aspect, and that three years is a reasonably period for a forecast to return to a budget surplus.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s latest budget, he stressed containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and France will work with Ukraine on a plan to end the fighting with Russia, which will later be presented to the United States, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The United Kingdom, along with France and possibly one or two others, will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting, and then we'll discuss that plan with the United States," Starmer told British media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer hosted Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders on Sunday for a summit on the conflict, which has taken on huge significance in the wake of the clash between the Ukrainian president and US counterpart Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said "nobody wants to see" the scenes of the two leaders' White House clash, and that "I am clear in my mind that he (Trump) does want a lasting peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister has presented himself as a bridge between the United States and Europe, and met with Trump in Washington on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we've had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a risk that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will come again if he's given the opportunity to do so..., which is why I've been so centrally focused on what a guarantee is. How do we defend the line if a line is agreed," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Where that physical line would be is "a subject for discussion", said Starmer. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefly Aerospace became the second US company to land on the moon on Sunday with its debut Blue Ghost lander, kicking off a two-week research mission as one of a handful of private firms to reach the frontlines of a global moon race.
 <br>
  <br>
  The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moon's Earth-facing side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight controllers at Firefly's Austin, Texas headquarters watched as Blue Ghost descended toward the moon's surface at a gentle two miles per hour, confirming on a live stream that the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're on the moon," declared Will Coogan, Blue Ghost Chief Engineer at Firefly Aerospace, from mission control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefly became the second private firm to score a soft moon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston-based Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lander made a lopsided soft touchdown last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the US, China, India and, last year, Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every single thing was clockwork, even when we landed, and then after, we saw everything was stable and upright," Firefly CEO Jason Kim said on stage at a company watch event in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the audience were hundreds of Firefly employees, space industry officials and senior Nasa leaders, including the agency's acting administrator Janet Petro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Firefly's in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two navigation cameras onboard Blue Ghost were used to spot hazards on the lunar surface during its final descent, helping the spacecraft steer toward an ideal landing spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impact sensors on the craft's four carbon-composite legs triggered Blue Ghost's engine to shutdown upon landing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two solar panels on the side and one of the top will power the lander and its research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus minus 173 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed by Nasa and its flagship Artemis moon programme, private companies are playing an outsized role in the modern moon race with the hopes of stimulating a lunar market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are building landers to put US astronauts on the moon as soon as 2027 for the first time since 1972. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Sunday slammed Israel's suspension of supplies and aid entering Gaza, describing it as a "war crime" and a violation of the ceasefire agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement", the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced earlier on Sunday that it was suspending the entry of supplies into Gaza, and threatened "consequences" for Hamas if it did not accept a proposal for a temporary extension of the truce in the Palestinian territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended," his office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Israel will not accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas persists with its refusal, there will be other consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance, expired on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said earlier on Sunday that it supported a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover, or April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the proposal came from the Trump administration's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopia dominated the competition at the Tokyo Marathon on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's categories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tadese Takele won the men's race in a time of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 23 seconds on Sunday as Uganda's double Olympic track champion Joshua Cheptegei finished ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele broke clear of the pack with around four kilometres to go in warm conditions to claim his first major marathon title, shaving a second off his previous personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele's compatriot Deresa Geleta was second in 2:03:51, with Kenya's Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich third in 2:04:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The weather wasn't a problem, it wasn't too hot and for me it was comfortable," said Takele.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The course was good and this was a great day for me. In the future, I hope to run even better than I did today."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's race, Ethiopia's Sutume Asefa Kebede defended her title, finishing in 2 hours, 16 minutes, 31 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya's Winfridah Moraa Moseti was second in 2:16:56, with Ethiopia's Hawi Feysa third in 2:17:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheptegei, who won gold in both the Tokyo Olympics 5,000m in 2021 and the 10,000m in Paris last year, was running his second marathon after making his debut at the distance in Valencia two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old finished in a time of 2:05:59.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, who was running her first marathon in 10 years at the age of 51, finished in a time of 2:57:26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Radcliffe also plans to run the Boston Marathon next month. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Sunday said most civil servants understood the need for a pay freeze given the government’s deficit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yeung said she had been told the move would not affect morale.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During the discussions, I approached many civil service colleagues and most of them told me they understood the situation. Some even said it had been expected. Before the budget announcement, some union representatives had said that it would not affect morale,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also announced in his budget speech on Wednesday that two percent of the civil service would be cut between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, with about 10,000 civil service posts expected to be slashed by April 1, 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the two percent cut was a minimum requirement, and departments could reduce more posts if they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Yeung said some vacancies had to be filled such as firefighters and teachers.

    'Taxing boundary-crossing drivers won't affect many'

<img alt="Paul Chan said on TVB that around 15 percent of people head to the mainland in private vehicles, and taxing them would not affect a great amount of people." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793870_1_20250302124329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said officials plan to go ahead with a proposed land departure tax for private cars, saying this represented a wealthier demographic in society.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposal announced in the budget last week met some opposition, with some lawmakers saying it wouldn't help Hong Kong's integration into the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan said these drivers amount to about 15 percent of the some 100 million departures annually, so there wouldn't be too many people affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because we spent much on these border facilities in terms of construction, and there are also maintenance costs," he said on a TVB programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a user's pay perspective, we ought to get some money back. We don't want to bother the general public."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed the government was still open to ideas and welcomed discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said there were many ways for people to cross the border, adding the government would not consider charging passengers who take the express rail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the administration plans to raise more than HK$150 billion worth of bonds every year for the coming five fiscal years, in part to finance infrastructure projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government would mainly issue short-term bonds, but added it has also received local market feedback expressing interest in longer term, Hong Kong dollar bonds that could be considered stable investment tools.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Technology and innovation chief Sun Dong on Sunday said policies related to artificial intelligence (AI) mentioned in last month's budget show the government’s commitment to high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan described AI as a “core industry” as he delivered the budget for the 2025-26 financial year, and said the government would support research and development efforts in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also announced that HK$1 billion would be earmarked for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the founding of the institute could benefit society in many ways, including applications in areas like government services, law, finance, healthcare and education.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that with AI advancing to its current level, every country and region needs to achieve breakthroughs in important areas, particularly in applications. Of course this involves some free exploration. Therefore while we want to encourage different research teams to explore AI freely, we also need to combine our limited resources to focus on development. That’s part of why we’re establishing the institute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology chief also noted there were 4,700 start-ups in the city at the end of last year, describing them as important pillars for Hong Kong’s future development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is four times what it was before the pandemic and over a 10 percent increase from the year before. The number is expected to go up again this year,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “Start-ups are looking at Hong Kong's innovation scene, government policies, the overall resources availability, and whether the business environment is good. When start-ups come here, talent will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has to have its own “star start-up” as it works its way to become an international I&T centre, the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun will lead a delegation, including representatives from the I&T sector, to Spain and Portugal on Sunday evening, to strengthen ties and cooperation between Hong Kong and the two countries in the field.

    Trump orders trade investigation into lumber

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered a new trade investigation that could heap more tariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25 percent tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods due next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his third new tariff probe in a week, Trump signed a memo ordering Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to initiate a national security investigation into US lumber imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The trade law is the one Trump also used to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe covers derivative products made from lumber which could include furniture such as kitchen cabinets, which in some cases are made of US lumber that had been exported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order said the Commerce Department investigation must be completed within 270 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered new steps within 90 days to increase the domestic supply of lumber by streamlining the permitting process for harvesting lumber from public lands and improving the salvage of fallen trees from forests and waterways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order calls for new or updated agency guidance to facilitate increased timber production, including quicker approvals for forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the lumber import probe would counteract the actions of big lumber exporters including Canada, Germany and Brazil, which he said were "dumping lumber into our markets at the expense of both our economic prosperity and national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That stops today with a pair of Trumpian actions designed to both bolster supply of and demand for American timber and lumber," he told reporters on a conference call ahead of the signing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said that increasing reliance on imported lumber represents a possible national security risk partly because the US military consumes significant quantities of lumber for its construction activities and because increasing dependence on imports for a commodity with ample domestic supplies is a danger to the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official did not provide details on a proposed tariff rate under the Section 232 lumber probe, but Trump earlier this month told reporters that he was thinking about imposing a 25 percent tariff rate on lumber and forest products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said any tariffs resulting from the probe would be added to the existing 14.5 percent combined anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Canadian softwood lumber.
  <br>
  <br>
  These were the result of a long-running US-Canada trade dispute over Canada's low stumpage fees on public lands, which Washington argues is an unfair subsidy. Most US lumber is harvested from private land at market-determined rates. Home builders have long criticised the tariffs as raising lumber prices and contributing to home price inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said the new lumber duties also would stack on top of Trump's threatened 25 percent general US tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods that are scheduled to take effect on Tuesday unless Trump is persuaded by the two countries' efforts to secure their borders and halt fentanyl trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff probe follows Trump's order on Tuesday for a new Section 232 into copper imports, aimed at rebuilding US production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware and the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 21, Trump ordered US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to revive investigations aimed at imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy digital services taxes on U.S. technology companies. Canada would again be in the firing line for such penalties, along with France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, India and Turkey. (Reuters)

 CK Infrastructure Holdings is considering a bid for KKR-backed British waste management firm Viridor, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based company is in talks with potential advisers as it evaluates a possible offer, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Bloomberg reported that KKR is exploring options for Viridor including a sale that could value the business at as much as 7 billion pounds (US$8.8 billion) including debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Infrastructure and KKR did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. A representative for CKI did not immediately respond to Bloomberg queries and KKR declined to comment to Bloomberg, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor operates energy recovery through its facilities in the UK to generate energy from residual waste, according to their website. (Reuters)

 American singer Angie Stone, who was nominated for three Grammy Awards, died at 63 early on Saturday, a representative confirmed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deborah R. Champagne, Stone's representative who last spoke with her shortly after 9 pm ET, said Stone died in a car accident in Montgomery, Alabama, following a performance.
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  Stone released her debut solo album, Black Diamond, in 1999. It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America the following year. Her highest charting album -"The Art of Love & War" released in 2007- peaked at 11 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.
  <br>

<img alt="Manchester City's English midfielder Nico O'Reilly celebrates scoring the team's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793851_1_20250302075410.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City survived a scare to beat giant killers Plymouth 3-1 and progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, after Crystal Palace striker Jean Philippe-Mateta was hospitalised in the Eagles' 3-1 win over Millwall.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had shocked Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round and were on course for another stunning upset at the Etihad when Maksym Talovierov headed them in front on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argyle boss Miron Muslic said it would be the "biggest honour" of his life to go head-to-head with Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  With FA Cup glory City's only realistic hope of silverware this season, Guardiola surprisingly rotated his side with Erling Haaland among those left on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was one of City's youngsters who took his chance to shine as Nico O'Reilly turned the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslic will be furious at the manner of both the 19-year-old's goals as he twice headed in from set-pieces under little pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Reilly's equaliser just before half-time calmed City's nerves before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that point Guardiola had summoned Haaland off the bench and he teed up the third for Kevin De Bruyne in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Big compliments to Plymouth for making our job so difficult. They were incredibly organised, but we played a good game," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace's progress into the last eight came at a cost as Mateta was stretchered off the field straight into an ambulance and taken to hospital in the early stages of their south London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was sent off just eight minutes in after catching Mateta's head with his boot as he raced out of the penalty area to clear the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Michael Oliver only issued a red card after a VAR review of the challenge, with Roberts winning the ball before accidently crashing his boot into Mateta's head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today," Mateta posted on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace later said he had been discharged from hospital after receiving 25 stitches "to a severe laceration to his left ear".
  <br>
  <br>
  Manager Oliver Glasner said the incident could have ended the Frenchman's career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career," said Glasner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace chairman Steve Parish described as the "most reckless challenge" he had ever seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made use of the man advantage to book their place in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japhet Tanganga's own goal put Palace ahead in the 33rd minute before Daniel Munoz prodded in the second seven minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth advanced to the last eight for only the third time in their history with a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Wolves after their 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson's 30th-minute opener for Bournemouth was followed by VAR controversy as Milos Kerkez had a second ruled out for offside after an eight-minute check when the new semi-automated version of the system broke down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha levelled for Wolves with a second-half rocket to force extra-time, but the Brazilian was sent off for violent conduct after repeatedly clashing with Kerkez just before the penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Matt Doherty missed when he had the chance to send Wolves through, Boubacar Traore hit the crossbar and Luis Sinisterra sealed the win for Andoni Iraola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milutin Osmajic taunted Burnley fans after helping Preston into the quarter-finals for the first time since 1966 with a 3-0 win at Deepdale.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the Championship sides played in the league two weeks ago, Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri accused Osmajic of racist abuse, allegations which the Preston striker denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnley players declined to shake hands with Montenegro international Osmajic before their latest meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osmajic got Preston's second goal late in the first half and celebrated by taunting Burnley fans with his hands cupped around his ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robbie Brady and Will Keane were also on target as Preston ended Burnley's 23-game unbeaten run. (AFP)

    Zelensky gets warm welcome in UK after Trump clash

<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday gave Volodymyr Zelensky a warm welcome in London, a day after the Ukrainian leader's clash with US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  And ahead of Sunday's summit in London to discuss how to support Ukraine as it battles Russia's forces, Starmer reiterated his support for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In partnership with our allies, we must intensify our preparations for the European element of security guarantees alongside continued discussions with the United States," he said in a statement issued late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for us to unite in order to guarantee the best outcome for Ukraine, protect European security, and secure our collective future," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours earlier, Ukraine and the UK unveiled a £2.26 billion (US$2.84 billion) loan agreement to support Ukraine's defence capabilities, to be paid back with the profits of immobilised sovereign Russian assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The funds will be directed toward weapons production in Ukraine," Zelensky said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is true justice -- the one who started the war must be the one to pay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters cheered as Zelensky's convoy swept into Downing Street, where he was embraced by Starmer and posed for photographs before heading inside the British leader's home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're very, very welcome here in Downing Street," Starmer told Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to thank you, the people of the United Kingdom, for such big support from the very beginning of this war," Zelensky responded.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to meet King Charles III on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders met behind closed doors for around 75 minutes, and embraced again as Starmer escorted Zelensky to his car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier Saturday Zelensky had stressed that Trump's support was still "crucial" for Ukraine despite their row the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash was a further shock to Kyiv's European allies, still adjusting to Washington's new stance on the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday as cameras in the Oval Office rolled, Trump berated Zelensky for not being "ready" for peace with Russia, triggering alarm across Europe. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) says people should make sure they are fully vaccinated against measles before travelling, after a man was hospitalised with the disease following a trip to Vietnam. The 38-year-old, who travelled to the country in early February, is now stable at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Although the CHP has classified the case as imported, the man stayed at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and visited its cafeteria while he was infectious.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP has set up a hotline on 2125 2372 for those who may have been exposed. It will operate until Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measles cases are rising in some countries due to low vaccination rates. While Hong Kong's vaccination coverage exceeds 95 percent, international travel poses a risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP controller Dr Edwin Tsui said anyone unsure of their vaccination status, especially travellers, should consult a doctor.

 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

    Delhi bans old cars from refuelling to help curb smog

<img alt="At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants have surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793825_1_20250301215153.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cars more than 15 years old will soon be barred from refuelling in New Delhi, the city's government said on Saturday, as part of measures to reduce the Indian capital's hazardous pollution levels.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Delhi is regularly ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world and is blanketed in acrid smog each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pollution is primarily blamed on agricultural burning by nearby farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds worsen the situation by trapping deadly pollutants each winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diesel and petrol cars older than 10 and 15 years, respectively, are not allowed to ply on Delhi roads, but many have been found flouting the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delhi's environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told reporters on Saturday that the decision to stop fuel for the old cars was made at a "marathon meeting" on air pollution to "find out the diseases and its remedies."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have decided to stop giving fuel to vehicles more than 15 years old after March 31, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "gadgets" would be installed at petrol pumps to identify such vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sirsa said other decisions taken include turning barren land into "new forests" and getting university students involved in planting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government would make it mandatory for high rises, hotels and Delhi airport to install anti-smog guns and gadgets to control pollution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public health crisis has grown steadily worse over the years, and weeks-long school closures across the capital, aimed at shielding vulnerable children from the harmful air, are now an annual occurrence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the peak of the smog, levels of PM2.5 pollutants – dangerous cancer-causing microparticles small enough to enter the bloodstream through the lungs – surged to more than 60 times the World Health Organisation's recommended daily maximum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Piecemeal government initiatives, such as partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air, have failed to make a noticeable impact. (AFP)

 A fencing duel between movie star Donnie Yen and Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong, a medley performance by celebrity couple George Lam and Sally Yeh, and a surprise appearance by singer and actor Andy Lau were some of the highlights for the opening ceremony of Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show, which went on until 8:35pm, half an hour longer than scheduled, was capped by a brief fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators said they were dazzled by the overall experience. Jimmy and Dhillon said they were super excited to see Donnie Yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had a fencing demonstration just now, mixing kung fu and fencing. Donnie Yen fencing against Vivian Kong, the Hong Kong champion. It looks like we are in the Olympics," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Gary, was pleased with his clear view to the stage, even he sat in the upper section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My seat is the top (row) one. So my sight is all the stadium and very huge. It makes me feel great. I’m very proud that Hong Kong has this (stadium)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alan, who went with his girlfriend, praised the facilities inside the stadium, although he felt the sound quality can be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of toilets is beyond my expectations… Just [every] few steps there's a toilet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hoped spectators can bring their own food or drinks in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did not buy any drinks or food inside - just the price consideration. We wanted to buy the popcorn but that is not the fresh popcorn, just pre-prepared food," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman from Zhuhai was overjoyed to see Andy Lau in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone was hoping to see the four heavenly kings," Zhang said, referring to 1990s Hong Kong pop idols Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, Jacky Cheung and Leon Lai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was awesome enough to see one of them show up."
  <br>
  <br>
  The event also drew in Jeffery and Arnold, both engineers involved in the sports park project.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like what you said, our baby. So it feels like we accomplished something because of our hardships and all the struggles that we faced here during the construction. Yeah, all the tears, the sweat," Jeffrey said.

    Hamas says 'no progress' on second phase of ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest round of talks on the second phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has made no progress so far, and it was unclear whether the talks would resume on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the ceasefire, which paused 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phase one expires on Saturday, but under the terms of the deal, fighting is not to resume while negotiations are underway on the second phase, which could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining living hostages returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on the second phase in Cairo, with the goal of bringing an end to the war with the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas did not attend the talks, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said there had been “no progress” on finding a solution before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was unclear whether those mediators were going to return to Cairo to resume talks on Saturday as has been expected, and Naim said he had “no idea” when negotiations might start again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas started the war with its October 7 2023, attack that left 1,200 dead in Israel. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say that more than half the dead have been women and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January, with the aim of bringing an end to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Hamas said that it “reaffirms its full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details” and called on the international community to pressure Israel to “immediately proceed to the second phase without any delay or evasion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to phase two of the ceasefire, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that mediators in the talks were “also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire’s first phase by 42 days, saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started on Saturday, in return for an additional hostage exchange, the Hamas member said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN food agency, the World Food Programme, said in a post on social media on Saturday that it reached 1 million Palestinians across Gaza during the deal’s first phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pause in fighting helped “restoring distribution points, reopening bakeries, and expanding cash assistance,” the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The ceasefire must hold,” it said. “There can be no going back.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The brand new Kai Tak Sports Park will help Hong Kong soar to new heights, the chief executive told the crowd during the opening ceremony on Saturday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Cantonese, Putonghua and English, John Lee also underlined his vision for the city’s newest landmark, built on the site vacated by the old airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the first successful trial flight 100 years ago to the establishment of an airport, today we have created Kai Tak Sports Park … a brand new stage for sports, culture and arts facing the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the park will be the perfect venue to kick off “Hong Kong Super March,” outlining a list of mega-events scheduled for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like this very stadium's retractable roof, the sky is the limit. From snooker, the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens to football, the upcoming sports events are sure to delight all - on and off the pitch,” he declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was then joined onstage by political and business leaders for the launching ceremony. They included the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, as well as Henry Cheng, chairman of New World Development, which built the park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 33,000 or so were treated to a Chinese drum performance and lion dance before the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media were allowed to stream roughly the first half an hour of the show, until 7 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the ceremony – including performances by singers Joey Yung, and demonstrations by national athletes – was kept under wraps until 9.30 pm, when four free-to-air TV channels will broadcast the event in full.

    PKK declares ceasefire with Turkey after 40 years

<img alt="Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's appeal as an " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793814_1_20250301193855.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Outlawed Kurdish militants on Saturday declared a ceasefire with Turkey following a landmark call by jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan asking the group to disband.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the first reaction from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) after Ocalan this week called for the dissolution of the group and asked it to lay down arms after fighting the Turkish state for over four decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to pave the way for the implementation of leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society, we are declaring a ceasefire effective from today," the PKK executive committee said, referring to Ocalan and quoted by the pro-PKK ANF news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We agree with the content of the call as it is, and we say that we will follow and implement it," the committee based in northern Iraq said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984 with the aim of carving out a homeland for Kurds, who account for around 20 percent of Turkey's 85 million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Ocalan was jailed in 1999, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several meetings with Ocalan at his island prison, the pro-Kurdish DEM party on Thursday relayed his appeal for PKK to lay down its weapons and convene a congress to announce the organisation's dissolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK said on Saturday it was ready to convene a congress as Ocalan wanted, but "for this to happen, a suitable secure environment must be created" and Ocalan "must personally direct and lead it for the success of the congress."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group also said Ocalan's prison conditions must be eased, adding he "must be able to live and work in physical freedom and be able to establish unhindered relationships with anyone he wants, including his friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the last round of peace talks collapsed in 2015, no further contact was made until October, when a hardline nationalist ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered a surprise peace gesture if Ocalan rejected violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Erdogan backed the rapprochement, his government cranked up pressure on the opposition, arresting hundreds of politicians, activists and journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erdogan on Friday said Ocalan's appeal was a "historic opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Turkey would "keep a close watch" to make sure the talks to end the insurgency were "brought to a successful conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the pressure of terrorism and arms is eliminated, the space for politics in democracy will naturally expand," Erdogan promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iraq has welcomed Ocalan's call, saying it was "a positive and important step towards achieving stability in the region."
  <br>
  <br>
  The PKK's presence in Iraq has been a recurrent source of tension between Baghdad and Ankara.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group holds positions in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, where Turkey also maintains military bases and often carries out ground and air operations against the Kurdish militants. (AFP)

    Pope spends 'peaceful night' after breathing crisis

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, hospitalised for two weeks with pneumonia in both lungs, spent a peaceful night after suffering a breathing crisis, the Vatican said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The pope spent a peaceful night and is resting," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff was put on a ventilator because of an "isolated" breathing crisis on Friday, the Vatican said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His doctors said it would take the next 24 to 48 hours to see if this breathing trouble has worsened his condition or not, a Vatican source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff is "not out of danger" but was "in good spirits," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis was hospitalised on February 14 with bronchitis, but his condition deteriorated into double pneumonia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medical experts have warned that Francis's age and the chronic respiratory disease from which he suffers mean a sustained recovery will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope, head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics, had part of one of his lungs removed as a young man and has suffered increasing health problems in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is prone to bronchitis and suffers from hip and knee pain, which has made him reliant on a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, Francis has continued to work from the special hospital suite on the Gemelli's 10th floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also has been doing breathing exercises in between resting and praying, according to the Vatican. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jubilant and excited crowds arrived at Kai Tak Sports Park ahead of the opening ceremony on Saturday night, but some were left confused by the rules of admission.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 90-minute ceremony will begin at 6:30pm, featuring celebrities including Donnie Yen, Gin Lee, MC Cheung, Joey Yung, as well as SAR athletes Vivian Kong and Jordan Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Edward, arrived two hours in advance. He said he couldn’t wait to see the stars and check out their performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course Joey, MC - those are the perfect performances that I want to look at. Also I know some of the sports stars will be joining. I'm looking forward to it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man, surnamed Wong, said his daughter helped him buy a ticket. The 67-year-old said he has never been to a big stadium before and called this an "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will welcome 33,600 spectators, including 8,500 lucky ones who managed to purchase tickets online.
  <br>
  <br>
  But to get in, they had to show up with electronic vouchers and identity documents to redeem a physical ticket by 3pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bosco and his girlfriend arrived half an hour before the deadline. He said the arrangement was a bit of a hassle but described the redemption process as smooth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it'll be better if the seats are arranged when I buy the tickets ... It's a bit troublesome to come here a few times," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us it's quite smooth because ... not many people are here. The process takes about five minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of others showed up after 3pm, including Alsen, who travelled from Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was thankful to get the ticket, but felt that signage directing spectators could be improved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many instructions that I can't identify. There's information but it still feels a bit hard for me to find the right place. I asked some police and others," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators were allowed to enter the main stadium from 4:30pm, after passing security checks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them were unaware of the list of items prohibited inside the venue. These include long umbrellas, plastic, glass or metal food containers, water bottles and so on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of odd. Maybe it's for safety reasons, but kids need their own water bottles. It means we need to spend money inside," said Mavis, who attended the gala with her two daughters and husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceremony will not be broadcast live, but four local TV channels, including RTHK, will carry the show at 9.30pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least four people died from their injuries in India after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials said on Saturday, as rescuers deployed helicopters to search for the remaining five missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 55 workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp on Friday near Mana village on the border with Tibet in the northern Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued on Saturday, the Indian army said 50 people were initially rescued, but among them, four succumbed to their injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, four injured persons have been confirmed as fatal casualty," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five workers were still missing, the army said, adding that six choppers had been deployed into rescue efforts as the "roads are blocked."
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the rescue teams were "continuously engaged in relief efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to those affected in this hour of crisis," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have said climate change was making weather events more severe, while the increased pace of development in the fragile Himalayan regions has also heightened fears about the fallout from deforestation and construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a huge glacier chunk fell into a river, triggering flash floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devastating monsoon floods and landslides in 2013 killed 6,000 people and led to calls for a review of development projects in the state. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five taxi companies which were awarded licences to operate taxi fleets will roll out the long-awaited service next week, according to the secretary for transport and logistics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on her blog, Mable Chan added the fleets will serve customers with a range of new electric vehicles. She and the fleet operators will meet the press in an official launch ceremony on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi fleet regime was introduced last year as part of the government’s efforts to improve the sector's service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme drew keen interest with 15 applicants. Three of them did not meet the prescribed requirements, such as having a driver monitoring system and the provision of online hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining applicants were then vetted by an assessment panel, and five who emerged as winners were each granted a five-year licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also gave updates on the government’s push to adopt new energy vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Transport Department has approved 152 domestic and 409 international electric vehicle models as of the end of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier amendments to the Road Traffic Regulation meant to enable certain features of these vehicles also took effect today.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include remote parking, which Chan expects to be well-received by many drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's land resources are precious, with many parking spaces being quite compact. You may have seen videos showing skillful parking manoeuvres ... sometimes drivers even need to exit through the sunroof," she wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-based singer songwriter Khalil Fong has died at the age of 41, his music label revealed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Fu Music said Fong passed away gently and gracefully on February 21 after battling a "relentless illness" for five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The music and graphic novels he gifted to the world remain an eternal testament to his luminous spirit, a timeless treasure for generations to come," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Hawaii and having debuted in 2005, Fong was known for his soul and R&B music.
  <br>
  <br>
  After releasing his ninth studio album "Journey to the West" in 2016, Fong took a break from his engagements due to health reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made a comeback last October with his final album "The Dreamer", and said back then he was on the road to recovery.

<img alt="Aryna Sabalenka at the Qatar Open 2025 WTA 1000 tennis tournament in February. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793781_1_20250301123815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka praised on Friday the WTA's mission to highlight the personalities of its athletes and called Saudi Arabia's investment in the women's tennis tour an important part of growing the game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WTA rebranding, complete with a new logo and "Rally the world" tagline, comes amid a rise in global viewership and a record US$4.8 million prize awarded last year to Coco Gauff for winning the WTA Finals in Riyadh, a tournament sponsored by Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot. We needed this refreshing moment for so long," Sabalenka told Reuters at a WTA-hosted cocktail party in Hollywood celebrating the tour's new look and mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big move and I hope it's going to help our sport to get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, a big-serving Belarusian who grew up admiring the power games of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, said giving fans a more intimate look at the stars of the tour would pay off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The WTA should show our personalities and what it takes to become a top athlete," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have to be an inspiration for the younger generation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Announced in May, the multi-year partnership with PIF marked the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership amid criticisms of the Gulf nation's human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been there a lot and they have passion for sport. Their help means a lot for us," Sabalenka said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support is very important for the WTA. I think all of us will be very grateful for their support."
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's ATP Tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" last year with PIF, which has pumped huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Search teams in northern India on Saturday attempted to rescue 22 workers believed to be trapped after an avalanche hit a remote border area, officials and local media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The workers were buried under snow and debris after the avalanche hit a construction camp near a village on the border with Tibet in Chamoli district on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said "relief and rescue operations have been accelerated" with the weather in the area clearing up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every effort is being made to safely evacuate all the workers trapped in the snow as soon as possible," Dhami said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the snow buried 55 workers initially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Army doctors at the site performed life-saving surgery on those critically injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mana village, which shares a border with Tibet, was deserted after residents moved to lower altitudes to escape the extreme weather, The Indian Express newspaper reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avalanches and landslides are common in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, especially during the winter season. (AFP)

    Hackman likely dead for nine days before being found

<img alt="Gene Hackman was a two-time Academy Award winner and credited for intense performances inspired by his troubled upbringing. (AFP)" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793774_1_20250301120931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hollywood legend Gene Hackman had likely been dead for over a week when he and his wife were found lifeless in their New Mexico home, the local sheriff said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities launched a probe into what they said were the "suspicious" deaths of Hackman, 95, and his classical pianist wife Betsy Arakawa, 63, as questions swirl over how the actor could have died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza told reporters that the partially mummified bodies had no external injuries but initial tests revealed "both individuals had tested negative for carbon monoxide."
  <br>
  <br>
  But, said Mendoza, tests had begun to narrow down a possible date of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An initial interrogation was conducted of Mr Hackman's pacemaker. This revealed that his last event was recorded on February 17, 2025," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that is a very good assumption, that was his last day of life."
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies of the Oscar-winning star of "The French Connection" and his wife were found on Wednesday, after emergency services were called to the scene when maintenance workers had been unable to access the sprawling property.
  <br>
  <br>
  First responders found the door unlocked and open, and pills scattered next to Arakawa's body, which was in the bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman's body was found in another room, fully clothed, with sunglasses next to his body, indicating a sudden fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  A German Shepherd was found dead in the bathroom, and two other healthy dogs were at the house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendoza said as they waited for the results of toxicology tests, which might shed some light on the tablets by Arakawa's body, investigators were now trying to piece together a timeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included looking through planners and cell phones and searching for any video that might give hints to the couple's movements over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, he said, it was a complicated task, compounded by their low profile.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everybody here understands that they were very private individuals and a very private family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hackman, a two-time Academy Award winner, was credited for intense performances of everyman characters inspired by his troubled upbringing, notching up dozens of movie credits extending into his 70s. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday said his proposal to freeze civil servant pay aims to show the government's determination in achieving a fiscal balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his budget speech on Wednesday, he proposed cutting recurrent government expenditure by two per cent for the coming financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some lawmakers and political parties suggested deeper cuts of five to 10 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK programme that salaries were the government's biggest expense, and it was best to take a cautious approach to any cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make some adjustments in this area, while maintaining the level of public services. Even when training staff to use technology, it takes time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that reducing recurrent expenditure by two per cent annually is more appropriate. If we move too quickly, haste makes waste and the results may not be as good."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief reiterated that he didn't want to rely too heavily on land income, citing the tremendous financial pressure on residents when land and property prices soared in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want housing to be as expensive as it was during times of short supply. So we'll continue our work on land supply. As for releasing prepared land, we can be flexible and take market conditions into consideration."
  <br>
  <br>
  On plans to roll out eight residential plots in the coming year, Chan said land sale plans shouldn't be linked to land premium income and this year's housing supply shouldn't be excessive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said the government would expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that many mainland enterprises had expressed an interest in its development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infrastructure investment for the Northern Metropolis has increased from HK$90 billion to HK$120 billion annually.

    Jos Buttler quits as England's white-ball captain

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jos Buttler resigned as England white-ball captain on Friday after his team made an early exit from the Champions Trophy with back-to-back defeats against Australia and Afghanistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team," Buttler said. "Hopefully somebody else who can come in alongside Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) will take the team to where it needs to be.”
  <br>
  <br>
  England lost two high-scoring games in Lahore and conceded the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 against Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler said he would lead England for the final time against South Africa in the last group match at Karachi.
  <br>
  <br>
  England had a disastrous preparation for the Champions Trophy when it won only one of its eight white-ball matches against India before arriving in Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overriding emotions are still sadness and disappointment,” Buttler said while expressing his willingness to continue representing England as a player.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure, in time, that (disappointment) will pass and I can get back to really enjoying my cricket, and (will) also be able to reflect on what an immense honour it is to captain your country and all the special things that come with it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler replaced Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball captain in 2022 and only months later won the T20 World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a sharp decline in England’s white-ball cricket with three unimpressive runs at the 2023 World Cup in India, 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies and now the Champions Trophy. (AP)

    Japan battles biggest wildfire in decades

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan was battling its largest wildfire in more than three decades on Saturday, one of several blazes that have killed one person and forced the evacuation of more than a thousand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flames are estimated to have spread over about 1,200 hectares in the forest of Ofunato in the northern region of Iwate since fire broke out on Wednesday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're still examining the size of the affected area, but it is the biggest since the 1992 wildfire in Kushiro, Hokkaido, an agency spokesman told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  That fire burned 1,030 hectares, the previous record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 1,700 firefighters were being mobilised from across the country, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aerial footage from public broadcaster NHK showed white smoke billowing up and covering an entire mountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police found the body of one person who had been burned on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 1,000 nearby residents have been evacuated and more than 80 buildings had been damaged as of Friday, according to the Ofunato municipality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the blaze remained unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other fires were also burning Saturday, one in Yamanashi and another elsewhere in Iwate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ofunato has seen only 2.5 millimetres of rainfall this month - on course to fall far below the previous record low for February of 4.4 millimetres in 1967.

 China's manufacturing activity grew in February after a dip the previous month, official figures showed on Saturday, as the United States targets the country's exports with increased tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a key measure of industrial output - came in at 50.2 in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), above the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  February's reading was up from 49.1 in January, when factory activity shrank for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production was boosted in February by the "gradual resumption of work by enterprises after the Chinese New Year," said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the services sector, came in at 50.4 in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has admitted the country's economy still faces "numerous difficulties".
  <br>
  <br>
  China's leadership convenes next week for the "Two Sessions" meetings, where analysts expect them to hammer out plans to shield the economy from tariffs and trade threats from the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump this week announced an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said it remained to be seen "how much will the US raise tariff next week, (and) how damaging will it be for China's export orders". (AFP)

    Card readers will be updated to allow for HK$2 tweaks

<div class="itemFullText">
 Users will be able to check the remaining number of discounted trips using an Octopus card reader when changes to the HK$2 elderly transport subsidy take effect, the labour and welfare chief Chris Sun said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government announced in the latest Financial Budget that there would be a cap of 240 trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that, while the flat rate of HK$2 remains for rides costing HK$10 or less, the government will only shoulder 80 percent of the cost if the standard fare exceeds HK$10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun noted that all 17,000 Octopus card readers in the SAR only allowed users to check the last 40 transactions and the remaining value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important for them to check whenever they want to check it - how many trips are remaining for that month. Right now, for the Octopus card they are holding, this is not a function with it. So we have to create that function for them to check it out," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, they have to go to... most likely one of the machines installed in most of the MTR stations where they can check their balance and also the recent transactions. So through that, what we call 'an Octopus card checker', when they just tap the card, they can check how many trips are still remaining for that month."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the government aims to put the changes in place no later than September next year, Sun emphasised that he hopes the amendment can take effect as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  He says he believes the new measures will help tackle the issue of commuters taking long-haul rides for only short trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister emphasised that the government would reach out to elderly in, what he called, a "very, very extensive way", to ensure they were aware of the tweaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated that the impact brought by the changes would be minimal, as 75 percent of the beneficiaries take rides costing less than HK$10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that Mexico has proposed matching US tariffs on China in a move that he described as "very interesting" and one that Canada should match.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top Mexican officials have met with members of Trump's cabinet this week for trade talks ahead of a March 4 deadline, when US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports are set to get into effect alongside an additional 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington said unilateral tariff hikes by the US severely violate World Trade Organization rules and harm interests for China, the US and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressuring, coercion and threat is not the right way to deal with China. Instead, mutual respect is the basic prerequisite," embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement to Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to correct its wrongdoing and return to the right track of addressing each other’s concerns through equal-footed consultations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration has said for months that it is carefully considering Washington and Ottawa's policies towards China, saying even before Trump's re-election that it sought to be "more aligned" in addressing Chinese trade practices. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's space station will welcome its first foreign astronaut in the next few years, after China and Pakistan on Friday signed a cooperation agreement on the selection and training of astronauts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said China and Pakistan would spend roughly a year selecting the Pakistani astronauts, who would be trained in China before joining Chinese counterparts on the Tiangong space station for short-term missions "within the next few years".
  <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the agreement was signed by Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office, and Muhammad Yousuf Khan, chairman of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission at the Prime Minister's House.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a country with historically close ties to China, Pakistan has in recent years sought to improve its own space capabilities by participating in Chinese initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last May, Pakistan was one of several countries that placed payloads aboard the Chang'e-6 lunar probe, which ended up making China the first country to successfully retrieve samples from the moon's far side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Completed in late 2022, Tiangong can house a maximum of three astronauts for months at an orbital altitude of up to 450 km.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has a designed operational lifespan of at least 15 years. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Security on Friday voiced firm opposition to the US threat of imposing an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese exports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson made the remarks in response to a media inquiry on the United States' threatened tariff hike, which is scheduled to take effect from March 4 and cited fentanyl issues as the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said that once again, the United States was using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, despite China's stringent anti-drug policies and active international cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has provided support to Washington in addressing the fentanyl issue out of humanitarian concern, achieving notable results, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the root cause of America's fentanyl crisis lies within the US itself, adding that reducing domestic demand and strengthen law enforcement cooperation were the fundamental solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the US continued to ignore the core issue of drug demand, unfairly shifting the blame onto other countries, which undermined efforts to solve the problem and harmed China-US cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing urged the US to preserve the progress in bilateral anti-drug cooperation, and "return to the right path". (Xinhua)

    Microsoft to shut Skype in favour of Teams

<img alt='The president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms says the company "can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams." File Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793738_1_20250301070354.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Microsoft on Friday announced it was retiring Skype, the online voice and video call pioneer that the tech titan acquired in 2011.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Starting in May 2025, Skype will no longer be available," said a post from Skype support on X, directing users to sign into Microsoft's Teams platform for further use of its services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skype was founded in 2003 by Scandinavians Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis in Estonia, revolutionizing internet communication by offering free voice calls between computers and affordable rates for calls to landlines and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the years, and as internet speeds improved, Skype evolved to include video calls, instant messaging, file sharing, and group communication features.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 2005, Skype had already reached 50 million registered users, demonstrating its rapid global adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online auction site eBay acquired Skype in 2005 for approximately US$2.6 billion, but the expected synergies never panned out, and in 2009, eBay sold a majority stake to a group of investors, who then sold it to Microsoft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, especially after the rise of the smartphone, Skype failed to hold onto its place against new rivals such as Meta-owned WhatsApp and Zoom, as well as Microsoft's own Teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned a lot from Skype... as we've evolved Teams over the last seven to eight years," Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative apps and platforms, told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we felt like now is the time because we can be simpler for the market, for our customer base, and we can deliver more innovation faster just by being focused on Teams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft said that Skype group chats would remain intact in the transition to Teams and that during a 60-day window, messages on Microsoft and Teams will be interoperable so you can message contacts from Teams, and those messages will be delivered to friends still using Skype. (AFP)

    Trump berates Zelensky in shock Oval office meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is "not ready" for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraine's mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more "thankful" and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been taken by Russia. "You're either going to make a deal or we're out," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying "he is not ready for Peace," Trump wrote. "He can come back when he is ready for Peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting - in front of a large group of journalists - had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky had said, "I think President Trump is on our side."
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is "fairly close." The US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be "very fair."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Friday said Trump showed "restraint" by not hitting Ukrainian Zelensky during their shouting match in the White House. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the Hong Kong Jockey Club is hopeful that legislation clearing the way for basketball betting will be passed by lawmakers by September this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government revealed in its latest budget that it is looking into regulating basketball betting, and will invite the Jockey Club to submit a proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that the club has already submitted a proposal framework and met with government officials on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jockey Club has suggested that legalising basketball betting could take reference to football betting, which means it will charge a 50 percent duty from net betting revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is expected that after legalising basketball betting, the club could draw 30 to 40 percent of the city's illegal betting turnover to the tune of HK$30 billion a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said that HK$1 billion to HK$2 billion has to be invested in infrastructure, such as the development of a new computer system that would be rolled out in 2026/27.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also expected that HK$1.5 billion in tax revenue could be generated for the government after four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the club will step up public education on basketball betting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club will contribute HK$50 million a year to the Ping Wo Fund that aims to help those with a gambling addiction.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An unspecified number of air traffic control staff have been suspended over an incident involving two cargo planes that triggered an alert after take-off.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Civil Aviation Department (CAD), the two aircraft were cleared to take off from Hong Kong International Airport on Thursday morning, heading to Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the cargo planes was told by air traffic control to climb to 5,000 feet, and the other to 3,000 feet, to maintain separation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as the climbing rates of the two cargo flights varied from what the (air traffic control) officers had anticipated, the desired vertical separation was not achieved," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this time, both cargo flights followed standard departure procedures and maintained visual contact with each other."
  <br>
  <br>
  The second plane then descended to 2,500 feet after its traffic collision avoidance system issued an alert to its crew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both aircraft continued to their destinations according to their flight plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CAD said preliminary information showed the incident might be due to air traffic control staff failing to abide by take-off protocols, and those involved have been temporarily removed from frontline duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan on Friday said the department has been ordered to submit a report on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The report has to include, for example, procedures and staff related to the incident. I hope it can help prevent similar incidents in the future and allow us to do better," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport and Logistics Bureau is aiming to complete a review on the fixed penalties for traffic-related offences and various fees and tolls this year, its chief said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest financial budget, the government revealed that it is hoping to increase revenue by HK$2 billion annually by doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Mable Chan said the bureau will focus on traffic charges that have not gone up for years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take parking meters as an example, [the charge] has not been adjusted for more than 30 years. And for fixed penalties for traffic-related offences such as parking [illegally], those too have not been adjusted for almost 30 years," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, our intention, apart from adhering to the principle of exercising fiscal prudence, is also to pay attention to traffic management, as well as road safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport minister said officials hope "an appropriate adjustment" can serve as a deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that drivers have to pay tolls at eight out of 18 government tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  She assured the public that the government will also consider people's affordability when carrying out the review.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king and two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung has encouraged students to never give up in the face of adversity.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was attending a student-sharing session after receiving an outstanding athlete award worth HK$3.375 million from his alma mater, Lam Tai Fai College.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung, who captured gold in the individual foil event in Tokyo in 2021 and in Paris last year, told students that it's not all glamorous for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had a disappointing performance during the 2024 Asian Fencing Championships, held about two months before the Paris Olympics, and it took him some time to regain his confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world no. 2 encouraged students to never forget their goals or be discouraged when they encounter any difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Table tennis star Wong Chun-ting, who partnered with Doo Hoi-kem to reach the mixed doubles semi-finals at the Paris Games, was a fellow alumnus and received a prize of HK$375,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school's supervisor, Lam Tai-fai, said the athlete award programme demonstrates the school's contributions to Hong Kong sports and education.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Asian Games gold medallist, Stone Shek, on Friday announced his retirement from gymnastics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shek, 33, said on social media that it's been a difficult yet rewarding journey, saying gymnastics has been his life and he would give his career a full score of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to grow every day, from all the injuries to different low points in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I could choose again, I would choose gymnastics every time," Shek wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Staying committed to something difficult is hard, but it's the mindset that defines success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having taken up gymnastics as a boy, Shek said he has gone through everything after 26 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked his family, coaches, friends and supporters for "remembering him as the prince of gymnastics".
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek won gold at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon on the vault, and successfully defended the title in Jakarta four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also captured two World Cup gold medals in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek represented Hong Kong, China at three Olympics: London in 2012, Tokyo in 2021 and Paris last year.

    Smaller housing plots in next land sale programme

<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the plots in the coming financial year's land sale programme can house less than a thousand flats each. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793689_1_20250228180230.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Friday that eight residential plots it plans to roll out in the coming financial year can house around 4,450 flats, more than a fifth less than the figure from the current fiscal year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said none of the plots in the coming land sale programme are able to accommodate more than a thousand units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the sites are in urban areas, in Tsuen Wan, Shau Kei Wan, Jordan Valley, Ngau Tau Kok and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The others are in Tung Chung, Stanley and Tuen Mun, whose Hoi Chu Road plot for around 500 homes will be introduced in the next quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials want to roll out sites in urban areas because there are signs the property market is recovering and these plots should be quite attractive.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some of them used to be school campuses, wet markets or planned community sites and officials decided to rezone them for housing because they were no longer needed for their original purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the government sites that have been developed in the past are not put to gainful use. Perhaps they have a lower development density, and after review we think that those sites can be put to better use," she told a press conference about the latest budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So given that this is an ongoing task, I would not rule out the possibility of more of such sites being rezoned for residential or commercial uses in future years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said officials will study the market situation before deciding which of the rest of the plots to put up and when.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that the government decided not to keep three plots from this year in the next land sale programme, because of market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted that one piece of land is in Kai Tak and said that has been removed because of abundant housing supply in the area. The other two plots to go are in Tuen Mun and Cheung Sha on Lantau.

    Govt seeking clarifications over latest US tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Friday said authorities are seeking clarifications as to whether new additional tariffs on Chinese imports announced by the US also cover goods from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump announced on his social media overnight that he will slap extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese imports from March 4, on top of additional 10 percent levies imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, the commerce chief said the US tariffs are "unreasonable", reiterating that SAR authorities are filing an official complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the earlier tariffs move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand better the details of this [latest] imposition, whether the Hong Kong production and products are included or excluded, so we are making assessments for the time being and seeking clarification," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually the volumes of Hong Kong products trading with the US are very minimal, accounting for only 0.1 percent of the total exports of Hong Kong, so the impact is not very significant at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials earlier confirmed that the first set of additional tariffs applies to Hong Kong, to which the SAR government responded by saying the US ignored the fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory as stated in Article 116 of the Basic Law and recognised by the World Trade Organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yau noted that Hong Kong is in discussions with Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on setting up economic and trade offices in the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong is exploring investment agreements with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru, while actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, the commerce chief said Hong Kong remains a major investment hub as 10,000 overseas companies had settled in the SAR by the end of last year, a 10 percent rise on the number at the end of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said while about one fifth of those firms come from the mainland, 1,400 are from Japan and another 1,400 are from the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also about 720 firms from the UK and 520 from Singapore, which indicates that the city is attractive to foreign investors from various regions, he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said China's economic fundamentals remain solid despite the difficulties and challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi wrote about "properly handling several key relationships in economic work" in an article to be published on Saturday in Qiushi Journal, the flagship magazine of the Communist Party Central Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the unfavourable impact of changes in the external environment has deepened, and China's economy still faces numerous difficulties and challenges," the president wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, it must be recognised that China's economic fundamentals remain solid, with numerous advantages, strong resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The conditions supporting long-term growth and the overall positive trajectory have not changed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Friday, Xi chaired a Politburo meeting discussing a draft government work report to be submitted by the State Council to the upcoming national legislative session for review.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was noted at the meeting that China's economy maintained overall stability and made steady progress in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is also essential to accelerate the forging of a new pattern of development, solidly promote high-quality development, further deepen reform comprehensively, expand high-standard opening up, build a modern industrial system and better coordinate development and security," Xinhua reported.
  <br>

 Hong Kong Unison, a group advocating the rights of the city's ethnic minorities, on Friday announced it was starting its dissolution process, saying its “historical mission has been successfully accomplished.”
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an executive committee meeting, committee chair Alice Chong said winding up the group was not an abrupt decision and it had started discussions around two or three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said 16 out of 17 members with voting rights supported the disband motion, adding it had nothing to do with political or financial matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are already more than 30 NGOs and groups that are now providing services and support in education, welfare, job and health to ethnic minority people. We are sure that they will be in good hands. We are also happy to [see] the government [has made] ethnic minority people as one of their priorities,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said the decision was backed by most former board members.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also noted the group had about HK$4 million in assets and after covering staff severance and long-term service pay, the rest of the money would be donated to other charity groups with similar goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation’s former executive director, John Tse, said he had not been consulted and called the move to disband “irresponsible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “How can we say that we’ve accomplished what we set out for? No one would say that, because look at the Hong Kong society, racism, discrimination against ethnic minorities, they’re so common,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse also noted the process of planning for winding up started back in September, but he was only instructed to stop receiving donations in late January.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he and two other former staff members were planning to start a new group to continue their work helping ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former project officer Javria Khalid said she was let go a month ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so hurt, I feel like that we have let our ethnic community down,” she said. “I'm so speechless right now. I don't even know how to tell the parents, the students, the awardees, everyone that Unison is shut down.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said about 100 people, as well as over 10 ongoing projects, which include Chinese classes and mental health counselling sessions, would be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Unison was founded in 2001 and was registered as a charitable organisation four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  It advocated for various policy changes to improve ethnic minority rights in Hong Kong, including the promotion of teaching of Chinese as a second language as well as getting the Race Discrimination Ordinance to come into effect in 2009.
