<img alt="Minister Algernon Yau says foreign businesses still have confidence in Hong Kong in spite of geopolitical tensions. Photo: Commercial Radio" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796905_1_20250322103943.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Saturday that the government is preparing to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US has imposed an additional 20 percent duty on goods from Hong Kong, the same as for mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau accused Donald Trump’s government of violating WTO agreements, which state that the SAR is a separate customs territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The executive orders of the US government noted that they are imposing new tariffs on goods from mainland China. But the Department of Homeland Security and Customs said the rule includes products of Hong Kong. This is a violation of the WTO agreement and it is completely wrong to mingle Hong Kong goods with those of China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the levies have a minimal impact on Hong Kong, noting the US has had a trade surplus of US$270 billion with the SAR over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said that despite rising geological tension between the US and China, foreign investors still have confidence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the last two years we’ve seen an increase of more than 900 foreign enterprises. And in 2024, there were 539 more, creating more than 7,000 jobs and HK$67 billion in investments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yai said the administration would continue to help local businesses find new opportunities in emerging markets, including ASEAN and Latin America.

<img alt="The former heavyweight boxing champion is renowned for his iconic battle with Muhammad Ali. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796902_1_20250322102434.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who fought and lost against Muhammad Ali in boxing's iconic 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday aged 76, his family announced in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family said in a statement posted on the boxer's official Instagram page.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Texas on January 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in Houston. The man who raised him was frequently absent and often drunk. Foreman only found out that J. D. Foreman was not his biological father after he won the world heavyweight when his real father, a decorated Second World War veteran, got in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an adolescent Foreman flirted with crime and dropped out of school at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood," his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024. "And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 16, he took up boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to a football player," Foreman said on his website. "I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Mexico Games in 1968, the 19-year-old Foreman bludgeoned his way to the super-heavyweight gold. As he celebrated his final victory, 10 days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos had made a black power salute following the 200m track final, Foreman waved an American flag in the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 6-foot-4 (1.93m), 'Big George' was larger and stronger than the other leading heavyweights of the time. He was light on his feet, but slugged his way through the professional ranks, to earn a heavyweight title shot against champion Joe Frazier, demolishing the champion in two rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the time he fought his third title defence over 15 rounds against Ali in October 1974 in Kinshasa, Foreman was unbeaten in 40 professional bouts. He had won all but three inside the distance and had not needed to develop stamina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ali's 'rope-a-dope' tactics, exhausted the big man who lost in eight rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat punctured Foreman's intimidating aura, not least, in his own mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title," he said later. "It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign for another title shot ended when he lost on points to another contender, Jimmy Young in March 1977 on a hot night in Puerto Rico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman fell ill after the fight and said he sensed God telling him to change his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  He retired, aged 28 and became an ordained minister. When he announced his comeback 10 years later, bald where he had once sported an afro and flabby instead of chiseled, it seemed like a boxing gimmick. He wrote later that he needed money for his youth centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Knockout -
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three years he fought 21 times, mostly against mediocre opponents, winning every bout, 20 of them inside the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A big name in a weakened and fragmented division, he earned a title shot against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and then against Tommy Morrison two years later, losing both on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 1994 he faced Michael Moorer, who had dethroned Holyfield. In the same shorts he had worn 20 years and six days earlier against Ali, Foreman was trailing badly when he caught Moorer on the chin in the 10th for a knockout. At 45 years and 299 days old he was the oldest heavyweight world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of first his WBA title and then his IBF title for refusing to fight nominated opponents but won three more fights and was still 'lineal' world champion when he lost on points to Shannon Briggs in 1997, aged 48, and retired again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He fought 81 times as a professional, winning 76, 68 of those by a knockout.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, he put his name to the "George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine", appearing smiling and friendly in the TV ads, becoming a celebrity outside boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman, who hosted a 1996 TV programme 'Bad Dads', married four times, fathering 10 children and adopting two.
  <br>
  <br>
  He named all his five sons George Edward, explaining that he wanted them to know, "'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!'" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR says Light Rail services are returning to normal after several routes in Tin Shui Wai were disrupted on Saturday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  It took maintenance staff in Tin Yuet about four hours to fix an overhead line, that had been damaged after being hit by a crane lorry damaged at around 7:30am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Routes 705, 706 and 751 had to be diverted as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR asked the public to use other forms of public transport, while laying on free shuttle buses for affected passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later arrested the 41-year-old crane lorry driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. The force said no one was hurt in the incident.

    French film star Depardieu to go on trial next week

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this would be the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer, Jeremie Assous, said the case was based on "false accusations" against his client, adding that the movie star was expected to attend the two-day trial after an initial hearing was postponed due to his ill health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say the assaults took place during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" (The Green Shutters).
  <br>
  <br>
  They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's identities have not been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A trial has been requested by prosecutors in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for one of the women said her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant," said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. "It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's trial could be the highest-profile #MeToo case to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States. (Reuters)

    Boeing wins contract for next generation US fighter

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing has been awarded the contract for the Air Force's next-generation stealth fighter plane, which the 47th US president said would be named the F-47.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47. The generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number, F-47," said Trump at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract aims to develop the replacement for the F-22 jet, which has been in operation for some two decades, with a new, more advanced aircraft able to operate alongside uncrewed drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing," Trump said in televised remarks in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the price of the contract could not be revealed for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking alongside Trump, said the new aircraft "sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we're not going anywhere and to our enemies that... we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement is a boon for Boeing, which faced a difficult last year in which it struggled with a lengthy labour strike and safety problems on its civilian airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns, a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the NGAD airframe could cost up to US$300 million apiece—significantly more than various other aircraft currently in the US inventory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, "officials cast doubt on whether the Air Force could afford to develop the NGAD alongside programs including the B-21 Raider bomber and the Minuteman III ICBM replacement," the Congressional Research Service said in a report earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The F-47 will replace the F-22 Raptor, which features stealth technology, a high degree of manoeuvrability, and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners. (AFP)

 China and Japan should enhance mutual trust and cooperation to provide global stability amid complex international challenges, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that since Ishiba took office, China-Japan ties have improved, highlighted by a productive meeting between President Xi Jinping and the Japanese leader in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan, both with important influence, should work together to build a better future for Asia, Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged Japan to uphold the principles of four key political documents, safeguard the political and legal foundations of bilateral ties, and honour commitments on historical issues, including Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for constructive engagement as the 80th anniversary of Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression approaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to strengthening ties, recognising the significance of bilateral agreements, and deepening cooperation to benefit both nations. (Xinhua)

<img alt="Hospital Authority director Michael Wong (right) says patients with financial difficulties can apply for an exemption or reduction. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796895_1_20250322085424.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Requiring patients to pay separately for tests and scans at public hospitals will leave them with a "minimal" financial burden as such services will still be "highly subsidised" by the government, health officials say amid plans to adjust medical fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the government covers the cost of diagnostic radiology services at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said it may charge separately for services such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, although emergency and hospitalised patients will remain exempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they hope hospital fees can be adjusted to a level where there would be a reasonable co-payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, a director at the Hospital Authority, said Hongkongers will likely be asked to pay a certain amount for "more complicated" radiology services, but this should not cost them too much.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This co-payment should still be a highly subsidised amount [from the government]. The public should expect the co-payment to be minimal, and [it] will not affect most of the patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the patients really have some financial difficulties in paying that small amount, they can still apply for a fee exemption or reduction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Introducing a co-payment model could be a way to tackle patient no-shows, Wong said, with around 10 percent of them missing scheduled appointments for medical imaging tests like CT and MRI scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, [we] could reduce this proportion of patients defaulting their attendance, and they could release the appointments for some other patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Lee, who chairs the authority's coordinating committee in radiology, said there were also cases of patients attending a scheduled appointment despite no longer requiring a check-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them, who had scheduled for a scan due to certain symptoms presented at the time of the medical consultation, had been treated for and recovered from their ailments before they could undergo the test, Lee explained.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel made a winning start to his England reign without delivering on his promise of a vibrant new era as the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel had urged England to play without fear after claiming they were "afraid" in a scathing assessment of their Euro 2024 runners-up finish under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the early returns were underwhelming as Tuchel's side dominated possession at Wembley without providing much entertainment for the sell-out 82,378 crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is far too early to judge Tuchel, the German -- England's third non-British manager -- must know significant improvements are needed on the road to next year's World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18 years and 176 days, Myles Lewis-Skelly made history in the first half when the Arsenal defender became the youngest player to score on his England debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the highlight of an inconsistent England display which was hard to distinguish from the erratic fare served up by Southgate during his eight years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Harry Kane, who played under Tuchel at Bayern Munich last season, netted late in the second half to put a more flattering gloss on the Group K opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old's 70th international goal came just 24 hours after England's record scorer claimed people were "bored" of his achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel was greeted with a banner unfurled by fans with the slogan "Welcome to the home of football Thomas" as he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  True to his word, Tuchel did not sing the English national anthem after saying he had to "earn the right" and there were few songs of praise for Tuchel as Wembley started to empty well before the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel, whose side host Latvia on Monday, at least avoiding become the first England boss since Bobby Robson in 1982 to fail to win his first match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel gave debuts to Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn, who scored in Sunday's League Cup final win at Wembley, while Marcus Rashford was given a starting berth after his revival on loan at Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three looked comfortable in Tuchel's 4-2-3-1 formation but England could only muster a workmanlike start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel stood in the technical area making occasional notes and clapping vigorously when England followed his demand for a high press to win the ball back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was even more animated in the 20th minute as his decision to select Lewis-Skelly paid rich dividends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jude Bellingham was the catalyst as he deftly turned to find space in midfield before stroking a sublime pass towards Lewis-Skelly, who timed his run perfectly to slot home from close-range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel pumped his arms in celebration, with a sheepish grin spreading across his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smile was nearly wiped from his face when Burn's miscued block from Qazim Laci's cross hit the bar in a panicked sequence that ended with the defender heading off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham's diving header was repelled by Thomas Strakosha before Kane's follow-up was brilliantly blocked by Berat Djimsiti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn almost reprised his Wembley goal against Liverpool last weekend with a towering header that clanged off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel's hope that England would play with more intensity wasn't helped by the soporific atmosphere, a stark contrast the Premier League passion he wants his team to emulate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane headed narrowly wide from Bellingham's cross after the interval, but England laboured to kill off an Albania side content to sit deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finally landed the knockout blow in the 77th minute as Declan Rice's cross reached Kane and he swivelled to curl into the far corner from 10 yards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain called late on Friday for an "immediate return" to a Gaza ceasefire, as Israel's military pressed its renewed offensive in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel on Tuesday began a fresh assault on the war-battered enclave, shattering the relative calm since a January 19 ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes in Gaza marks a dramatic step backward for the people of Gaza. We are appalled by the civilian casualties and urgently call for an immediate return to a ceasefire," the ministers said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint appeal came after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened Friday to annex parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas did not release the remaining Israeli hostages being held there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers -- Germany's Annalena Baerbock, France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy -- called on "all parties to re-engage with negotiations to ensure the ceasefire is implemented in full and becomes permanent".
  <br>
  <br>
  They said Hamas must release the dozens of hostages remaining in the Palestinian territory and that the group "must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore".
  <br>
  <br>
  The allies said Israel must "fully respect international law" and allow the flow of aid into the territory. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed higher Friday after fluctuations, shaking off ongoing economic uncertainty including those triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff plans -- following his comments that these will contain some flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent to 41,985.35, and the broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent as well to 5,667.56.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.5 percent to 17,784.05.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is certainly some hesitation, as we still have a lot of the trade uncertainties ahead of us with the April 2nd reciprocal tariff announcements," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, Trump has promised reciprocal levies tailored to each US trading partner, to remedy practices deemed unfair by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president told reporters Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans, and markets appeared to react with some relief at day-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kourkafas cautioned however that "we don't know what's going to happen necessarily, how long it's going to last, which could keep volatility elevated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, shares in package delivery firm FedEx closed 6.5 percent down after it lowered forecasts for this year, noting weakness and uncertainty in the US industrial economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic footwear and apparel giant Nike saw its shares fall by 5.5 percent after earlier reporting a decline in quarterly revenues. (AFP)

    Flights at London Heathrow resume after power outage

<img alt="The closure not only caused misery for travellers but provoked anger from airlines. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796876_1_20250322061716.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Flights at Britain's Heathrow resumed late on Friday after a fire knocked out its power supply and shut Europe's busiest airport for the day, stranding tens of thousands of passengers and causing travel turmoil worldwide.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said its teams worked tirelessly to reopen the world's fifth-busiest airport after it was forced to close entirely after a huge fire engulfed a nearby substation on Thursday night, with travellers told to stay away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airport had been due to handle 1,351 flights on Friday, flying up to 291,000 passengers, but planes were diverted to other airports in Britain and across Europe, while many long-haul flights returned to their point of departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said there would be a limited number of flights on Friday, mostly focused on relocating aircraft and bringing planes into London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow morning, we expect to be back in full operation, to 100 percent operation as a normal day," said Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye. "What I'd like to do is to apologise to the many people who have had their travel affected ... we are very sorry about all the inconvenience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said that after an initial assessment they were not treating the incident as suspicious, although enquiries remained ongoing. London Fire Brigade said its investigations would focus on the electrical distribution equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closure not only caused misery for travellers but provoked anger from airlines, which questioned how such crucial infrastructure could fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The industry is now facing the prospect of a financial hit costing tens of millions of pounds, and a likely fight over who should pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You would think they would have significant back-up power," one top executive from a European airline told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow's Woldbye said back-up systems and procedures had worked as they should.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This (power supply) is a bit of a weak point," he told reporters outside the airport. "But of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked who would pay, he said there were "procedures in place", adding "we don't have liabilities in place for incidents like this".
  <br>
  <br>
  British transport minister Heidi Alexander said the incident had been out of Heathrow's control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have stood up their resilience plans very swiftly and have been working in close collaboration with all the emergency responders and the airline operators," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airlines including JetBlue, American Airlines, Air Canada, Air India, Delta Air Lines, Qantas, United Airlines, IAG-owned British Airways and Virgin were diverted or returned to their origin airports in the middle of the night, according to data from flight analytics firm Cirium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in many airlines, including US carriers, fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aviation experts said the last time European airports experienced disruption on such a large scale was the 2010 Icelandic volcanic ash cloud that grounded some 100,000 flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  While flights are restarting, it will be some time before all scheduled passenger services return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have flight and cabin crew colleagues and planes that are currently at locations where we weren’t planning on them to be," said Sean Doyle, chief executive of British Airways, the biggest carrier at Heathrow which had 341 flights scheduled to land there on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, it will have a huge impact on all of our customers flying with us over the coming days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Department for Transport said it had temporarily lifted restrictions on overnight flights to ease congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers stranded in London and facing the prospect of days of disruptions were scrambling to make alternate travel arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty stressful," Robyn Autry, 39, a professor, who had been due to fly home to New York. "I'm worried about how much is it going to cost me to fix this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices at hotels around Heathrow jumped, with booking sites offering rooms for 500 pounds (US$645), roughly five times the normal price levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airline executives, electrical engineers and passengers questioned how Britain's gateway to the world could be forced to close by one fire, however large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow and London's other major airports have been hit by other outages in recent years, most recently by an automated gate failure and an air traffic system meltdown, both in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Ingram, a former intelligence officer in the British military, said Heathrow's inability to keep operating exposed vulnerability in Britain's critical national infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a wake-up call," he told Reuters. "There is no way that Heathrow should be taken out completely because of a failure in one power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, the head of the global airlines body IATA and a former head of British Airways, said Heathrow had once again let passengers down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow said it had diesel generators and uninterruptible power supplies in place to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely. Those systems all operated as expected. But with the airport consuming as much energy as a small city, it said it could not run all its operations safely on back-up systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Keir Starmer's spokesperson said there were questions to answer about how the incident occurred and there would be a thorough investigation. (Reuters)

    Counter-terror police probe fire that closed Heathrow

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Counter-terror police on Friday launched a probe into an electricity substation fire that shut down Heathrow airport causing travel chaos for passengers around the world and the cancellation or diversion of hundreds of flights from Europe's busiest air hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow plies routes to around 80 countries and some 1,350 flights had been due to land or take off from the airport's five terminals on Friday, according to the online flight tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 230,000 passengers a day and 83 million a year use Heathrow, making it one of the world's busiest airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said the force's Counter Terrorism Command was leading enquiries given the "impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "While there is currently no indication of foul play we retain an open mind at this time," a spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters were called to the "highly visible" blaze at the substation shortly after 2320 GMT on Thursday and around 70 were sent to battle the fire, which was brought under control by 0800 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses saw water cannons were still being used at the smoking fire site at around 1300 GMT.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband promised that the government would do all it could to restore power to Heathrow quickly, as questions were raised about the airport's "resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown left many frustrated passengers struggling to make alternative arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced, according to Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK's second busiest airport, Gatwick, said it would accept some flights from Heathrow. Others were diverted to European airports including Shannon in southwestern Ireland, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith said firefighters had worked "tirelessly in challenging and very hazardous conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters the fire had involved a "transformer comprising of 25,000 litres of cooling oil fully alight" posing a hazard due to the substation's "still live high voltage equipment."
  <br>
  <br>
  One resident near the substation recalled hearing a "massive explosion" as the power cut out just before midnight while another reported seeing a "bright flash of white."
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 150 people were evacuated from nearby properties because of the fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outage left 100,000 homes without power overnight. By morning, power had been restored to all but around 4,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the scale of the disruption began to emerge, Miliband faced questions about how one fire could shut down an entire airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the electricity distribution network National Grid had told him they had not seen "anything like the scale" of what happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it makes Heathrow look quite vulnerable and therefore we've got to learn lessons, as I say, about not just Heathrow but how we protect our major infrastructure," he told ITV News.
  <br>
  <br>
  Willie Walsh, director general of the airline industry trade association IATA, said the closure was "yet another case of Heathrow letting down both travellers and airlines."
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case – as it seems – then it is a clear planning failure by the airport," he said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights from all over the world were affected by the closure and aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes said it would cost "more than £50 million (US$64.7 million)" to the airport and airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Situated 25 kilometres west of central London, Heathrow's main flight destinations last year were Dublin, Los Angeles, Madrid and New York. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday a strategic partnership between the government-backed investment firm and a mainland chipmaker will speed up adoption of the popular RISC-V chips in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Chan delivered a keynote speech at the signing ceremony to mark the deal between Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) and Shanghai-based semiconductor start-up, StarFive, which produces the chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  RISC-V is an open-source architecture that is used to design a range of less-sophisticated chips and allows developers to configure and customise their chip designs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's considered capable of challenging Intel's x86 architecture's domination of the personal computer market as well as the Arm Holdings architecture that dominates the smartphone markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event via a recorded video, Chan said that based on the characteristics of the RISC-V architecture as well as Hong Kong's strengths, the two sides could together reach new heights in creating new industries and forging global cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the application of open-source large language models, such as that of DeepSeek's, become more inclusive and flexible, combining it with the supply and applications of RISC-V open-source chips will mean a great reduction in cost and a great increase in their flexibilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, as the RISC-V technology is now being developed at a fast speed, there's a need to further enrich [its relevant] industrial clusters and for accelerated international collaboration. This will allow Hong Kong to fully leverage our advantages under One Country, Two Systems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan said the collaboration with StarFive will bring co-operation between the tech firm and local universities and institutes, while bringing new employment opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  StarFive, she added, will also give priority to the SAR as its potential listing venue in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal came as Beijing has been doubling down on the use of the RISC-V architecture as a bet to strengthen its domestic chip industry and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it's not known how much HKIC has invested in the six-year-old RISC-V chipmaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, Chan also said in his weekly blog that the design and application of RISC-V open source chips is an important part of strategic planning for Hong Kong's future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year was the deadliest year for migrants, with nearly 9,000 people dying worldwide, the United Nations said on Friday, calling the "tragedy... unacceptable and preventable".
 <br>
  <br>
  "At least 8,938 people died on migration routes worldwide in 2024," the fifth year that numbers have reached record highs, the UN's migration agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tragedy of the growing number of migrant deaths worldwide is both unacceptable and preventable," said Ugochi Daniels, the deputy director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind every number is a human being, someone for whom the loss is devastating," Daniels said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The actual number of migrant deaths and disappearances is likely much higher, as many have gone undocumented because of the dearth of official sources," the IOM said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the identities and other details of the majority of victims were unknown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia, Africa and Europe had record numbers of people dying in 2024 with 2,778, 2,242 and 233 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 2,452 people were recorded as dying in the Mediterranean Sea, the main gateway for those trying to reach Europe, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final data were not available yet for the Americas but figures so far show at least 1,233 people died.
  <br>
  <br>
  These included "an unprecedented 341 lives lost in the Caribbean in 2024 and a record 174 deaths of migrants crossing the Darien" jungle between Colombia and Panama.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Darien jungle was at one point the main migratory corridor for people trying to reach the United States. (AFP)

<img alt="Hasan Nawaz celebrates his century against New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796831_1_20250321182455.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Hasan Nawaz struck a record-breaking maiden century on Friday as Pakistan crushed New Zealand by nine wickets in the third Twenty20 to keep the series alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  After scoring a duck in each of the two opening games – the first innings of his international career – Nawaz rebounded with a stunning 105 not out in Auckland as the tourists raced to 207-1 in response to New Zealand's 204.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old's ton came off 44 balls, the fastest by any Pakistan player in a T20 international.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ensured his team reached the target with four full overs to spare, in a stark reversal of form after heavy losses in Christchurch and Dunedin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaz put his early failures behind him with a sparkling knock featuring shots all around the wicket, including a series of audacious ramp shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted he was worried about his selection prospects after two failures and thanked captain Salman Agha and vice-captain Shadab Khan for showing faith in his ability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way I got out in the first two matches, I was very disheartened, but the captain and Shadab supported me, told me I am a match-winning player and that helped me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to score my first run in international cricket, that's what I was thinking. After I scored one run, the pressure was released and I wanted to win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander peppered the short Eden Park boundaries with 10 fours and seven sixes, bringing up victory with successive fours off Kyle Jamieson in the 16th over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of those shots took Nawaz to 100, five balls faster than the previous Pakistan record-holder – Babar Azam against South Africa in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow opener Mohammad Haris scored 41 off 20 while captain Salman Agha was unbeaten on 51 off 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell conceded they had few answers to halt Nawaz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to tip your hat to Nawaz there, the way that he played was unbelievable," Bracewell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty tough to defend out here but when a guy plays like that, it's really tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, New Zealand looked well placed after Mark Chapman hit a rapid 94 before they were dismissed in their final over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, tallying 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the home side's batsmen struggled to get going, aside from Bracewell's 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan's best figures of 3-29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game four of the five-match series is in Mount Maunganui on Sunday. (AFP)

<img alt="Lewis Hamilton in a Ferrari during the sprint qualifier. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796819_1_20250321175331.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "gobsmacked" Lewis Hamilton obliterated the Shanghai lap record to take a stunning pole position on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix sprint in only his second race weekend with Ferrari.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, who has won a record six Chinese Grands Prix, flew round the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit in 1min 30.849sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lap easily beat the 1:32.238 set in 2004 at the inaugural Chinese GP by fellow seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, also in a Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who won both the sprint and main race in China last year, was second fastest 0.018sec behind and McLaren's Oscar Piastri was third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles Leclerc was fourth as Ferrari showed a big improvement from Melbourne, where Hamilton was 10th and Leclerc eighth -- the Scuderia's worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just a bit gobsmacked, taken back by it. I didn't know when we would get to this position," said Hamilton, who emerged from his car to a huge ovation from the Chinese fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started out straight away with a better feeling in the car. I can't believe we are at the front, ahead of a McLaren which has been so fast throughout winter testing, Australia and even today."
  <br>
  <br>
  A big surprise was Melbourne winner Lando Norris, whose McLaren had been fastest by almost half a second in morning practice ahead of Leclerc, Piastri and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris was sixth after he ran wide and aborted his final flying lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made a mistake. I locked up in the last corner," admitted Norris, who complained his car was not to his liking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just too many mistakes but just too difficult of a car to drive," the Englishman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he was fortunate to be second on the grid for the sprint race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lap was very good. I don't even think we should have been on the front row anyway so I'm very happy to be second," said the four-time world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell was fifth with his teammate Kimi Antonelli seventh behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda's RB, Alex Albon's Williams and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin rounded out the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was difficult to understand the difference between Friday's sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes McLaren had a huge gap, sometimes not so. Let's analyse it. We have a lot of work to do," Vasseur told Sky Sports F1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it's a good feeling and gives a positive energy to the team and Lewis, but I always see the negative side."
  <br>
  <br>
  All the cars were obligated to run medium-compound tyres in the first two sprint qualifying sessions, termed SQ1 and SQ2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson had a bad start to his weekend, failing to get out of the first session after having a lap time deleted for exceeding track limits and the New Zealander will start 20th and last.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated after the first session were the Alpine pair of Jack Doohan and Pierre Gasly, Haas's Esteban Ocon and the Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  In SQ2, Fernando Alonso was 11th in the Aston Martin and missed out on the top-10 shootout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated were Oliver Bearman's Haas, the Williams of Carlos Sainz, Gabriel Bortoleto in a Sauber and Isack Hadjar's RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the Chinese Grand Prix over 56 laps. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the government will soon offer land for private development in Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, now that the first three buildings in zone's Hong Kong Park have been completed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee's remarks came as he attended the topping-out ceremony for the No 8 and 9 laboratory buildings in the zone in Lok Ma Chau Loop, which also saw the successful completion of the No 11 talent accommodation building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the completion of the buildings marks a milestone for technological collaboration between the Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments and paves the way for the zone to become a world-class cluster.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more private firms to participate in jointly developing the high-tech area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon select suitable sites this year and seek private development plans to make use of the market forces to accelerate the development of the park, and we will complete the detailed planning of the second phase of the park within this year," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the gradual completion of the park, it will provide more room for the development of more innovation and technology enterprises and talents, and I call on all sectors from society as well as market forces to actively participate [in the park's development]," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee, who chairs the park's steering committee, said a second edition of the committee's meeting was held yesterday to speed up planning and usage of the three buildings, and authorities are now going all out with development plans for five more planned buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of tenants, including companies specialising in bio-health technology and data science, is expected to be move in and start operating during the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the government also said it is earmarking HK$3.7 billion to assist the park's construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, meanwhile, noted that the SAR government will continue to explore the possibility of eliciting policy support from the mainland to enhance the free flow of personnel, resources, capital and data to assist with cross-border collaboration.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they will launch a citywide operation next week to tackle inattentive driving, following an increase in fatal traffic accidents in the first three months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said there were 21 fatal accidents from January to March, up around 40 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, the force said most cases involved motorcyclists and truck drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan Sin-hang, a chief inspector with the force, explained the reasons for the increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the reasons may be because of the end of the new year and there may be a lot of deliveries for the truck drivers. So maybe they're in a hurry, and so they neglected the situation on the road,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They failed to pay attention to the road situation and maybe they didn't maintain a safe distance with the cars in front of them, or they didn't pay attention before they cut into the other lane, and also speeding.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting next week, police will launch a stringent enforcement operation across Hong Kong to combat careless driving, speeding, and jaywalking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force also reported 18,355 traffic accidents in 2024, involving 23,659 injuries, most of which were minor.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A French aeronautic services company on Friday said it is working with the Airport Authority (AA) to develop the SAR into Asia’s first aircraft parts processing and trading hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French firm, Elior Group, signed a memorandum of understanding with the authority last month to explore the possibility of providing services such as aircraft dismantling, parts recycling and related training in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its chairman Daniel Derichebourg said the company is looking forward to developing and exploring new opportunities in Hong Kong, and expanding its businesses across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said it will discuss the topic of training local talents with the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The city has always been a prime location for foreign investment and international conglomerates,” said Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role of connecting the mainland and the world to attract more companies from around the world to set up in the city,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, the director-general of investment promotion at InvestHK – which will help Elior set up its Asia headquarters in Hong Kong – said: “The signing of this MoU is a testament to global businesses confidence in the Hong Kong market."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added the move reaffirms "that Hong Kong is the ideal destination for companies to establish or expand their operations in the region”.
  <br>
  <br>
  And transport minister Mabel Chan said she is pleased about the collaboration, which will enrich the SAR’s position as an international aviation hub and support the aviation development in the country and Asia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Housing Authority committee tightened rules on Friday for well-off public housing tenants, raising the likelihood that their rent would more than double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new measures, which will be implemented in October, could also see hundreds of well-off households required to move out in four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, households that earn two to five times the income limit are paying 1.5 times to double the standard rent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the changes, they'd have to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the normal rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said that within a four-year period, if a tenant's income is twice found to be between four to five times the limit, the tenants will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for those who earn five times the limit, the rule remains that they must return the flat immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairwoman of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, said the government is expected to receive around HK$1.5 billion more a year as a result of the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, she stressed that the move is not about raising government revenue but about ensuring a fair use of public resources and ensuring all tenants have a similar income-to-rent ratio.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of this review, generally well-off tenants will now be paying roughly 11 percent of their household income as their rental housing expenses," Wong said after a committee meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 'ables' should pay more."
  <br>
  <br>
  The rental changes, she added, will affect around five percent of public rental tenants, or around 40,000 households.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said rules for well-off tenants to buy subsidised flats are also being relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those earning four to five times the limit will keep their status as green form applicants for four more years after they'd moved out of public housing.

    NJZ loses court fight to leave label

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court on Friday ruled against popular K-pop girl group NewJeans, which had sought to sever ties with their label ADOR over what they called "mistreatment" by the company.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group, which now calls themselves NJZ and is to appear in Hong Kong's ComplexCon this weekend, made headlines in November by announcing their decision to leave ADOR, whose parent company HYBE is behind K-pop sensation BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The label later filed for an injunction to maintain its status as the managing agency of NewJeans, requesting that the Seoul Central District Court prohibit the group's members from engaging in independent commercial activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court sided with ADOR, issuing a ruling that the group, now branding themselves as NJZ, must not pursue independent endeavours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said that if the group "unilaterally terminate their exclusive contract" with ADOR, and change their name autonomously, the label would suffer "significant damages".
  <br>
  <br>
  The group's actions would also "severely damage not only the brand value of NewJeans but also ADOR's reputation as a management company," the court added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans made their debut in 2022 and the K-pop phenomenon is among HYBE's most successful acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans and ADOR have been caught in the heated contract dispute since August, following allegations that HYBE forced out the group's star producer, Min Hee-jin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The band issued an ultimatum for Min's reinstatement, which HYBE declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the members took their grievances public, accusing the label of intentionally sabotaging their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Band member Hanni alleged last year that the group experienced workplace harassment, such as "deliberate miscommunications and manipulation regarding multiple areas" while working with ADOR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm," she said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the court on Friday said that based on the claims and evidence submitted by the group, it is "difficult to conclude that ADOR has sufficiently violated the essential obligations of the exclusive contract."
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR welcomed the court's "judicious" decision, and said they "eagerly anticipate meeting with the artists for a heartfelt conversation at the earliest opportunity".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With our status as NewJeans' exclusive agency now legally affirmed, we are fully committed to supporting the artists going forward," it said. (With additional reporting from AFP)

    HKMU launches Cantonese opera translation library

<img alt="The team behind the Cantonese opera translations says they pay special attention to the culture and history behind the stories. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796790_1_20250321154817.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Metropolitan University on Friday launched a new online library that features English translations of classic Cantonese opera scripts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The project started a year ago and the initial collection includes scripts from the renowned Cantonese opera “Forty Years of Cherished Love”, which tells the tragic love story of the poet Lu You and his wife Tang Wan in the Song dynasty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Chan, director of the university’s Ina Ho Cantonese Opera Research Centre and head of the team, said she hopes the translations will bring Cantonese opera to a broader audience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan – who is also a language and translation professor – noted that the team has also included explainers to certain translations to make it easier for English readers to understand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you see the Chinese term ‘milky way', what does that mean, especially for westerners? Does it mean silver river? There's actually a love story behind, for the cowherd and the weaving girl, so that would be more beneficial for people who did not really know this tradition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheryl Zhang, who is part of the translation team, said one challenge is to balance language and cultural context.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Their love story was so sorrowful and carries grief. In the translation, we had to pay so much attention to the emotions, the cultural, and particularly, historical phase behind the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nine-member team is currently working on translating more works, including selections from the opera adaptation of “The Dream of the Red Chamber”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their full collection is currently only available to the university’s students and staff, though people who are interested in the works can reach out to the university to request full access to the library.

<img alt="Fans queue for limited-edition Labubu toys created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796791_1_20250321154832.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A global pop culture festival ComplexCon has returned to Hong Kong for a second year, with organisers expecting the stronger lineup to bring in more visitors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event was held outside the United States for the first time last year, attracting over 30,000 visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser said it expects visitor numbers to hit 35,000 this year, as it has a stronger live concert lineup that includes American record producer Metro Boomin and the well-known K-pop group NJZ.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a Seoul district court ruled on Friday against NJZ in its attempt to leave the ADOR label and prohibited the group from "pursuing independent endeavours."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement made hours after the ruling, NJZ said the group will be participating in ComplexCon.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festival also features a marketplace for trendy products, with fans queuing for limited-edition goods of the Labubu toy created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the United States said he had been to ComplexCon in Las Vegas before and it was different with that in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The one in Las Vegas was really big, but this one still is really nice. We got the VIP ticket, so we can get in early and see what's here,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for some Labubu stuff. We've been all over Hong Kong looking for Labubu things. We went to all the Pop Marts. Everything was sold out. So it's really nice that this is open right now.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The ComplexCon marketplace is also a platform for NJZ to release their first-ever merchandise following a name change from NewJeans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-year-old Hong Kong fan of the group said he arrived early to get the goods as they are very limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I have already queued for like 40 minutes already. I really want the keychain and the T-shirt,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I've been really liking them for a long time, [since] I was 12 or 13. I already wanted to come before they said NJZ is coming. So it's like a bonus for the event.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival, which opens on Friday, ends on Sunday at the AsiaWorld-Expo in Chek Lap Kok.

    Cathay Pacific cancels flights to London

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific said on Friday it cancelled two flights from Hong Kong to London, due to the temporary closure of Heathrow Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Cathay Pacific flights CX239 and CX253 from Hong Kong to London on 21 March have been cancelled," a statement by the airline said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CX251 and CX255, due to depart Hong Kong for London late Friday, will operate normally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, all flights from London to Hong Kong operated by the airline have also been cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are assessing the situation and will keep our customers informed with the latest updates," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some affected passengers at the Hong Kong International Airport were left frustrated with the airline's arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsie Slade, who is returning home to London, said it was "chaos" with Cathay staff members giving her different instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't understand why they can't just say: 'wait here and we will sort it out for you'," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another passenger surnamed Choi said he understood it was a rare incident, but noted there's room for improvement in the airline's response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have travelled for 40 years and never had this experience," he said. "They said it's not their problem. That triggered us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others, including a passenger surnamed Siu, decided to look for alternative ways of getting to London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I used about 25 minutes to finish booking another flight [that is] a week later... I have plenty of time," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Olympic bronze medallist Andy Diaz Hernandez produced a stunning early effort of 17.8 metres to capture the triple jump gold medal in the first final of the world indoor athletics championships on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cuban-born European champion broke the Italian record with his first jump of the day and comfortably staved off his challengers, with China's Zhu Yaming taking the silver with a distance of 17.33 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Almir Dos Santos grabbed the bronze with 17.22 metres, while defending champion Hugues Fabrice Zango of Burkina Faso only managed fourth place with 17.15 metres in Nanjing's Cube.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz Hernandez fouled in the second round before deciding not to take his third, fourth and fifth attempts. He returned for the sixth round, merely running through, however, soaking up the cheers from the crowd. (Reuters)

    Norris chalks up fastest practice lap in Chinese GP

<img alt="Mechanics work on Lando Norris' car in the pits during the first practice session of the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix at the Shanghai International Circuit. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796771_1_20250321132157.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris was fastest in practice on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix, the championship leader lapping almost half a second quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri third.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton was fourth quickest as Ferrari bounced back from a dismal opening race in Australia last weekend to split the dominant McLaren duo ahead of sprint race qualifying later on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris won in Melbourne and McLaren would have had a one-two if not for Piastri's late spin, which handed defending four-time world champion Max Verstappen second in his Red Bull.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who won both the sprint race and the grand prix in Shanghai last year, struggled and aborted his final lap on soft tyres leaving him only 16th fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris clocked 1min 31.504sec around the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit, where long turns and heavy braking zones are notoriously punishing on tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was 0.454sec ahead of Leclerc with Piastri 0.195 further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conditions were a contrast to last weekend's wet and wild season-opener in Melbourne that saw several crashes and stints under the safety car.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session was the teams' only opportunity to hone their set-ups before Friday afternoon's sprint qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Times tumbled as the new asphalt rubbered in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "big four" teams – Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes – all battled for early supremacy, swapping fastest times on the medium compound tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a much improved session for Ferrari after Melbourne, where the seven-time world champion Hamilton came home only 10th after the team strategists gambled and lost on leaving him out on slick tyres in rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc was eighth with Ferrari's five points representing their worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Jack Doohan failed to complete a lap on his debut and had more woe in Shanghai when his Alpine lost power, bringing out the red flags 13 minutes from the end of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point all the teams had run only on medium tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the session resumed with eight minutes to go it saw a congested dash from the pit lane to record a qualifying simulation lap as everyone bolted on the faster softs.
  <br>
  <br>
  George Russell's Mercedes was fifth fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sixth, with Alex Albon's Williams, Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes and Yuki Tsunoda's RB making up the rest of the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the main race over 56 laps. (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said the city will soon launch a HK$3 billion scheme to support local academic and scientific research, as authorities ramp up efforts to transition Hong Kong into a global innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks at the opening of the International Academicians Hong Kong Forum in Wan Chai, where he noted that the role of scholars and scientists is critical in aiding Hong Kong's technological transition, amid evolving and unprecedented global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum also marked the founding of the International Alliance of Academicians (IAA).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Knowledge knows no borders, our shared challenges require shared solutions. The government is committed to cultivating a dynamic environment, one that champions innovation and technology, in every sector and industry, every institution and corner of our community," he told participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will soon launch a Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, worth HK$3 billion, or nearly US$400 million. It will help fund groundbreaking basic research driven by world-class researchers and academics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the completion of the first three buildings in the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park will also help provide the "hardware" for local I&T development, and that the alliance could serve as the "soft power".
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Nancy Ip, President of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who chairs the IAA, said that Hong Kong is an ideal base for the alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given its international status and dynamic academic and research sectors, Hong Kong is ideally positioned to foster scientific cooperation among leading scholars from around the world. This global alliance will also solidify Hong Kong's reputation as an international innovation and technology centre," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAA alliance is made up of 100 academics from around the world, and aims to enhance global collaboration among scientists and academics.

<img alt="Vinicius Jr and a teammate celebrate after the stoppage-time winner against Colombia at the Mane Garrincha stadium in Brasilia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796760_1_20250321123836.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vinicius Junior struck a dramatic winner in the ninth minute of stoppage time to give Brazil a 2-1 win over Colombia in their South American World Cup qualifier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-time world champions had taken a sixth-minute lead in Brasilia through a Raphinha penalty only for Luis Diaz's fine 41st-minute strike for Colombia to level the game on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia enjoyed the most pressure in the second half but were ultimately sunk by the Real Madrid winger's dramatic winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory leaves Brazil well positioned in second place in the 10-team CONMEBOL qualifying group, four points behind leaders Argentina who travel to Uruguay on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A foul from Daniel Munoz on Vinicius resulted in the early penalty for Brazil and Raphinha, taking a short run-up, confidently slotted home the spot-kick to give the home side an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But four minutes before the break, James Rodriguez found Liverpool's Diaz on the left and the winger moved inside before driving it home into the far, bottom corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodriguez had an opening in the 68th minute, after a smart move from Colombia, but the playmaker's shot was comfortably dealt with by Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz's Liverpool team-mate Becker had to go off injured in the 78th minute, with an apparent concussion, after a collision with Colombia's Davinson Sanchez which resulted in the defender being stretchered off.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Colombia enjoyed the bulk of attacking possession, Brazil remained a threat and Guilherme Arana flashed a shot wide in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alisson injury had created the lengthy stoppage time and Vinicius took advantage with his fiercely struck effort taking a slight deflection off a defender's head and flying in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's goal is a bit of relief, a bit of happiness. Playing for the national team is something you can't explain," said Vinicius.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time we come here, it's like it's the first time".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil face old rivals Argentina on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a bitter ending for a Colombia side who sit in sixth place still with work to do in qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kept Brazil in their half, I think we deserved more again, but that's the way it is. I have a lot of doubts about the refereeing decisions, which I'm not going to comment on," said Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a great game and came away with nothing again. We conceded a very early goal again," he lamented.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American qualifiers on Thursday, Paraguay beat bottom-placed Chile 1-0 in Asuncion, a result that left La Roja rooted to the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran 41-year-old striker Paolo Guerrero was on target as Peru beat Bolivia 3-1 to move off the bottom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Polo opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Guerrero found the target on the stroke of half-time. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolivia pulled one back with a Miguel Terceros penalty in the 58th minute before Edison Flores restored the two-goal cushion in the 82nd minute.

    All eyes on safety in low-altitude test runs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport chief Mable Chan said on Friday most pilot projects in Hong Kong's first-ever low-altitude economy test run will be operated manually and within the line of sight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox trials will test airspace management, flight operations and emergency responses to support the use of unmanned aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial phase, comprising 38 projects, is set to begin next month at Science Park, Cyberport and on some outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  One project will be a food delivery test run between Science Park and Ma On Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told an RTHK radio programme that safety is the top priority, noting that drones are equipped with propellers and backup systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on safety and risk-based principles, we will begin by operating gradually within visual range," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For future beyond line-of-sight flights covering longer distances, we aim to advance further based on flight data collected from line-of-sight runs and assessments of safety considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of tech and innovation research, some laboratories at universities are currently developing safety features for these drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've developed various self-defence mechanisms for the drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, when one drone is in operation, another drone will monitor it nearby at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on another radio programme, Chan said officials will study the possibility of developing a low-altitude economy in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to amend regulations to increase drone weight limits from 25 kilogrammes to 150kg to allow more advanced drones to carry heavier loads.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has seen its winding-up orders hitting the highest level in more than 15 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed that 66 winding-up orders were made by the court in February, up 83 percent from a year earlier and an increase of 14 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's the highest monthly figure since September 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for bankruptcy petitions, the figure stood at 787 in February, an increase of 21.5 percent year on year but a 3.9 percent drop from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year taken together, the number of bankruptcy petitions reached 1,606, 15 percent higher from the same period a year earlier.

<img alt="Sergei Shoigu earlier made visits to Pyongyang as North Korea geared up to deploy troops to fight for Russia. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796749_1_20250321113943.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin's top security adviser Sergei Shoigu has arrived in North Korea and plans to meet its leader Kim Jong-un, the Tass news agency reported on Friday, his latest visit amid dramatic advances in security ties between the countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Tass report did not have further details and North Korea's state media have not reported on Shoigu's arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shoigu, former defence minister until May last year, had earlier made visits to Pyongyang as North Korea geared up to deploy troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and South Korean officials have said North Korea has deployed more than 10,000 troops who were sent into combat in Russia's eastern Kursk region and also shipped heavy weapons including artillery and ballistic missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is believed to have received military and civilian technology and economic assistance from Moscow in return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow has acknowledged Pyongyang's deployment of troops and weapons, but said they had continued to implement a strategic partnership treaty signed by the countries' leaders in June last year that includes a mutual defence pact. (Reuters)

    London's Heathrow airport closes due to power outage

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Heathrow Airport on Friday said it would be closed until midnight after experiencing a significant power outage due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation supplying the airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  "To maintain the safety of our passengers and colleagues, Heathrow will be closed until 23h59 on 21 March," Heathrow Airport said in a post on X, adding that passengers are advised not to travel to the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no clarity on when power may be reliably restored, a Heathrow spokesperson told Reuters in an email, and added they expect significant disruption over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eurocontrol, which manages air traffic control operations across Europe, said on its operations website that no arrivals were being allowed at Heathrow due to the power outage and there were diversion plans in place for flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, some diversions to other airports were already occurring, with Qantas Airways sending its flight from Perth to Paris and a United Airlines New York flight heading to Shannon, Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  A United Airlines flight from San Francisco was due to land in Washington, DC rather than London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow was the world's second-busiest international airport in 2024 behind Dubai, according to travel data firm OAG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London Fire Brigade said its crews were tackling the fire in Hayes in west London and had evacuated around 150 people from the area as a precaution. (Reuters)

    N Korea tests new anti-aircraft system

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea test-fired its latest anti-aircraft missile system in a drill watched by leader Kim Jong-un, state media reported on Friday, as the nuclear-armed state lashed out at US-South Korea joint drills.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch proved the system's "combat fast response," the Korean Central News Agency said, and came a day after South Korea wrapped up a major annual joint military exercise with the United States, known as Freedom Shield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim praised the latest anti-aircraft system, saying North Korea's army would be "equipped with another major defence weapon system with laudable combat performance," the news agency wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify where the test took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul said last week the North fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" after it began the joint drills involving US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement on Thursday, an official for the North's defence ministry denounced the military exercise as "no more than a rehearsal of war of aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also carried out a test-launch of strategic cruise missiles in the Yellow Sea in late February, which it said showed off "counterattack capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent Freedom Shield exercise featured a collaborative drill focused on countering weapons of mass destruction, specifically targeting nuclear, chemical, biological, and radioactive threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said that more than 10,000 soldiers from the reclusive North were sent to Russia last year to help it fight a shock Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk border region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's spy agency said last month that the North has sent more soldiers to Russia and re-deployed several to the frontline in Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by Seoul's defence ministry said the North was "continuing to provide weapons, ammunition and other military support to Russia following its troop deployment in the Ukraine war". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third seed Coco Gauff crushed fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-0 6-0 at the Miami Open, the former U.S. Open champion producing a flawless display to reach the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, aiming to win her maiden Miami title, won 84 percent of her first-serve points, saved the one break point she faced and converted six of her nine break points in the 47-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely playing well today, and maybe she wasn't playing her peak great tennis," Gauff said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think anyone who is playing their best tennis will have that scoreline today, so I'm not going to sit here and say she played her best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Gauff, who was eliminated in the round of 16 at Indian Wells last week, will be Ashlyn Krueger who stunned seventh seed Elena Rybakina 6-4 2-6 6-4 for the first top-10 win of her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed and two-times Grand Slam champion Aryna Sabalenka, playing her first match since losing to Mirra Andreeva in the Indian Wells final, broke Bulgarian Viktoriya Tomova six times en route to a 6-3 6-0 win.

<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris arrives in Shanghai atop the drivers’ standings for the first time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796732_1_20250321100549.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren’s dominance, Lewis Hamilton’s bid to bounce back after a disappointing debut for Ferrari, and the passing of Eddie Jordan have generated headlines as Formula 1 prepares for its first "Sprint weekend" of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lando Norris arrived in Shanghai on top of the drivers’ standings for the first time following his win at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix last Sunday, but it was his qualifying pace for McLaren – and not just holding off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen – that had his rivals on edge ahead of practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes driver George Russell went so far as to say McLaren could win every race this season, describing its raw pace advantage as “bigger than Red Bull has ever had”.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, while Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri strongly refuted the claim — stating the form would change between rounds – the rest of the paddock wasn’t so sure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They're definitely ahead,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The gap in qualifying, the gap that there was in Australia is more or less what there is."
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we are around Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of lap times if we put everything together," Leclerc said, "so there’s still a big chunk to get McLaren then.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For seven-time world champion Hamilton, meanwhile, China is a chance for a reset after a difficult Ferrari debut at Melbourne’s Albert Park last weekend, where he qualified eighth, briefly took the lead, but couldn’t hold onto it because of the team's tire strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 40-year-old, who is F1's most successful driver with a record 105 GP wins and 104 pole positions, says he still needs more time to bring the full force of his experience to his new team.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As I get more comfortable and more knowledgeable about the car, I can start making more decisions,” Hamilton said of his preferred set up. “I’m having those discussions, and I’m going to lean a little bit more with adding my experience hopefully a bit more in it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton is hopeful that the Australian GP was an outlier for him and for Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope so,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think our car looked pretty decent in Australia and even on Saturday morning. So, I think it’s a bit of a one-off.” (AP)

<img alt="Ronen Bar says his sacking is intended to 'prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7' attack. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796737_1_20250321102045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, was sacked on Friday, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he no longer trusts him, and fallout from a report on the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will leave his post when his successor is appointed or by April 10 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu on Sunday cited an "ongoing lack of trust" as the reason for moving to dismiss Bar, who joined the agency in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar, meant to end his tenure next year, was appointed Shin Bet chief in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented October Hamas attack which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  It acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said "a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal provoked the anger of the opposition and led to demonstrations accusing Netanyahu of threatening democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several thousand people braved bad weather late on Thursday to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's private residence in Jerusalem and then the Israeli parliament, where ministers were meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter made public on Thursday, Bar said Netanyahu's arguments were "general, unsubstantiated accusations that seem to hide the motivations behind the decision to terminate [his] duties".
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote the real motives were based on "personal interest" and intended to "prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7 and other serious matters" being looked at by the Shin Bet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He referred to the "complex, wide-ranging and highly sensitive investigation" involving people close to Netanyahu who allegedly received money from Qatar, a case dubbed "Qatargate" by the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal comes after the Israeli army launched a series of massive and deadly bombardments on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, following a two-month truce and "targeted" ground operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said the operations were intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the 58 hostages remaining in the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rare criticism of Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that he was worried the resumption of strikes in a time of crisis could undermine "national resilience." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Saudi Arabia in a Fifa 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday, leaving it struggling at the bottom of Group C in the Asian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decisive moment came five minutes into the second half when Saudi midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari scored from close range, capitalising on a rebound after Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei blocked an initial shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's task became even more challenging just before the break when Lin Liangming was shown a red card for a reckless kick to the face of Saudi defender Hassan Kadish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident resulted in a lengthy stoppage as Kadish received treatment before being carried off the field on a stretcher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite dominating possession, the hosts were unable to convert their chances, with a first-half goal by Faisel Al-Ghamdi ruled out by video footage for handball, further compounding their frustrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  After seven matches, China remains at the bottom of Group C with just six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will next take on Australia at home on Tuesday and will look to turn their fortunes around. (Xinhua)

    'Coalition of willing' to meet next week on Ukraine

<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new meeting after a European Union summit in Brussels. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796727_1_20250321094059.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine would meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure a potential truce in the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The huddle in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the latest in a series of high-stakes gatherings and will come after Kyiv and Moscow hold talks in Saudi Arabia with the United States on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's announcement on Thursday came after London played host to the latest discussions of military top brass from the so-called "coalition of the willing" around Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said plans on policing a possible ceasefire were "coming together" as US President Donald Trump forges ahead with Russia on ending its war on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron - who along with Starmer has said he is willing to deploy troops to Ukraine - said the meeting next Thursday will be a chance to "fine-tune" work on ensuring any truce is durable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky told an EU summit that "nothing had changed" as Moscow has kept up bombardments despite agreeing with Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin must "stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war", calling on the EU to ramp up arms deliveries and keep sanctions in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders vowed in a joint declaration, which was agreed without the support of Russia-friendly Hungary, to step up military support despite Moscow's demands for foreign support to stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they stopped short of endorsing a request from Zelensky to give Kyiv US$5.4 billion for artillery shells, in the face of opposition from France and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Norway, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US officials would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday to build on US-led efforts to secure an end to the war with Russian, now grinding into its fourth year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin had earlier confirmed Russian officials would also hold talks with the US side in Saudi Arabia on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky and Putin both held talks with Trump this week, and have indicated they are prepared to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days. (AFP)

    World's glacier mass shrank again in 2024, says UN

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 All 19 of the world's glacier regions experienced a net loss of mass in 2024 for the third consecutive year, the United Nations said on Friday, warning that saving the planet's glaciers was now a matter of "survival".
 <br>
  <br>
  Five of the last six years have seen the most rapid glacier retreat on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization weather, climate and water agency said, on the inaugural World Day for Glaciers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preservation of glaciers is not just an environmental, economic and societal necessity: it's a matter of survival," said WMO chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, more than 275,000 glaciers worldwide cover approximately 700,000 square kilometres, said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are rapidly shrinking due to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 hydrological year marked the third year in a row in which all 19 glacier regions experienced a net mass loss," the WMO added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, they lost 450 billion tonnes of mass, the agency said, citing new data from the Swiss-based World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fourth worst year on record, with the worst being in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates of melting, many glaciers in western Canada and the United States, Scandinavia, central Europe, the Caucasus, and New Zealand "will not survive the 21st century", said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said that together with ice sheets, glaciers store around 70 percent of the world's freshwater resources, with high mountain regions acting like the world's water towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they disappear, that would threaten water supplies for millions of people downstream. (AFP)

    China calls for protections for students in US

<img alt="Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the US not to impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796721_1_20250321092239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the US after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their students, citing national security concerns.
 <br>
  <br>
  A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the US and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is in the interest of both parties," Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. "We urge the US to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described America’s student visa system as a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to the country's top research institutions and posing a direct threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrolments at your university.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in US schools. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, a decades-old goal of the American right, which wants individual states to run schools free from the influence of federal government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks set up in the East Room of the White House, Trump smiled as held up the order after signing it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the order would "begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress, but Trump's order will likely have the power to starve it of funds and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is one of the most drastic steps yet in the brutal overhaul of the government that Trump is carrying out with the help of tech tycoon Elon Musk and his Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats and educators have slammed the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called it a "tyrannical power grab" and "one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast the move as necessary to save money and improve educational standards in the United States, saying they are lagging behind those in Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But education has been a battleground for decades in America's culture wars, and Republicans have long wanted to remove control of it from the federal government. (AFP)

    Perisic stars as Croatia stun France in Nations League

<img alt="Croatia's Ivan Perisic celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against France. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796706_1_20250321061557.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ivan Perisic scored one goal and made another as Croatia beat France 2-0 to seize the upper hand in the first leg of their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Perisic crossed for Ante Budimir to head in the opener at the Stadion Poljud in Split after the home side had squandered an early penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  With France out of sorts, Perisic made it 2-0 before the break and a Croatia side captained by Luka Modric saw out the victory to take to Paris for the return match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not a good night for France as captain Kylian Mbappe made his comeback having not featured in either of the last two international windows, in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappe did have chances, notably seeing a deflected second-half shot from Ousmane Dembele's cutback kept out by a fine Dominik Livakovic save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid superstar has now failed to find the net in his last six appearances for his country, since scoring a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus will now have to find a way of overturning the deficit at the Stade de France on Sunday, otherwise Croatia will be heading to the final four of the Nations League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will take place in June and will be hosted by either Italy or Germany, depending on which of those sides emerges victorious from their last-eight encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won the Nations League in 2021 but suffered a first ever defeat against Croatia in the group stage of the following year's edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest repeat of the 2018 World Cup final, won 4-2 by the French in Moscow, saw Croatia win a spot-kick just five minutes in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate was penalised for a blatant handball inside the area, but Mike Maignan saved Andrej Kramaric's penalty after a long delay due to the goalkeeper having a laser pen shone in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Croatia did get the breakthrough on 26 minutes as Budimir, who has 15 goals in La Liga this season for Osasuna, got in front of William Saliba to connect with a Perisic cross from the left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budimir's header was blocked by Maignan, but the ball still spun into the net in cruel fashion for the goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 2-0 in first-half stoppage time as Saliba blocked a shot by Martin Baturina, only for the ball to fall for PSV Eindhoven veteran Perisic to fire in.
  <br>
  <br>
  France made changes, sending on Dayot Upamecano for Konate at the restart and later bringing on Bradley Barcola for Randal Kolo Muani and Michael Olise for Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter spent more time on the right flank after the break having previously been deployed more centrally.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they could not get a goal back and now face a daunting task in trying to recover the tie. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Thursday, as a Fed-related rally lost steam, and traders looked ahead to the prospect of additional tariffs next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 0.1 percent at 41,953.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,662, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to close at 17,691.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started off in the red, went solidly into the green, only to go back into the red, then back into the green and now we're kind of flatlining," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP, shortly before markets slipped further into the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think investors are basically going to be treading water until April 2," he added, referring to the date at which US President Donald Trump has said he plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, professional firm Accenture's shares slumped 6.7 percent after announcing that the Trump administration's efficiency drive had begun affecting its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The business consulting firm said the cost-cutting drive, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, had hit its federal services business. (AFP)

<img alt="The US$6.1 billion sale of the Boston Celtics is a record price among US-based sports teams. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796701_1_20250321055144.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA's Boston Celtics are being sold to the head of a California private equity firm for US$6.1 billion, a record price for a US sports franchise, according to reports by The Boston Globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper, citing a league source, said the Celtics ownership had agreed to sell the iconic team to William Chisholm, managing director and co-founder of Symphony Technology Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US$6.1 billion purchase price is the highest ever offered for a North American sports team, surpassing the US$6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of the Celtics, the current NBA champions, still requires the approval of the NBA Board of Governors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is one of the most storied in the league's history, with a record 18 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, is a longtime fan of the team, according to the Globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the new ownership group also includes current Celtics co-owner Robert Hale; Bruce Beal Jr., president of Related Companies; and the global investment firm, Sixth Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper said three other buyers had been under consideration: Steve Pagliuca, a Celtics co-owner; Stan Middleman, a co-owner of MLB's Philadelphia Phillies; and The Friedkin Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grousbeck family and Pagliuca purchased the Celtics for US$360 million in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three NBA teams were sold in 2023 – the Phoenix Suns for US$4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks for US$3.5 billion and the Dallas Mavericks for US$3.5 billion. (AFP)

    Vancouver auto show bans Tesla over safety concerns

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla was removed from the Vancouver International Auto Show in Canada because of safety concerns, the event organisers said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw," Eric Nicholl, executive director for the auto show said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The safety concerns come as protesters across the United States stage demonstrations targeting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's move to shrink the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff," Nicholl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto on Monday stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares due to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's mayor said that the decision was meant to target Musk, a close adviser to the US president. Trump has called for Canada's annexation and imposed tariffs on Canadian products, angering Canadians. (Reuters)

    Oxygen detected in most distant galaxy: astronomers

<img alt="Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796693_1_20250321032017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oxygen has been detected in the most distant galaxy ever discovered, surprised astronomers said on Thursday, offering further evidence that stars in the early universe matured far quicker than had been thought possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, which was discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope last year, is so far away that its light took 13.4 billion years to reach Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means the galaxy can also reveal what the universe was like in its infancy, when it was just 300 million years old – two percent of its current age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since coming online in 2022, the powerful Webb telescope has discovered that galaxies in the young universe were much brighter, more advanced and more numerous than scientists had expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  These discoveries have been so startling they have raised doubts about whether something important is missing in our understanding of the universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the latest research, two international teams led by Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  They detected traces of oxygen, according to the European Southern Observatory, confirming hints previously spotted by the Webb telescope.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period known as the cosmic dawn, newly born galaxies were thought to only have young stars, which mostly contain light elements like hydrogen and helium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only later were they supposed to get heavier stuff such as oxygen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the two new studies found that JADES-GS-z14-0 has around 10 times more heavy elements than had been anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies," said Sander Schouws of Leiden Observatory, the first author of a Dutch-led study to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astrophysicist Stefano Carniani, lead author of the Italian-led paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, said he was "astonished by the unexpected results."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States fell to its lowest happiness ranking ever partly due to a rise in the number of Americans eating their meals alone, an annual UN-sponsored report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Finland ranked as the world's happiest country for the eighth straight year in the World Happiness Report, with locals and experts thanking its grand lakes and strong welfare system for boosting its mood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan, plagued by a humanitarian catastrophe since the Taliban regained control in 2020, once again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States fell to 24th place, its lowest score since the report was first published in 2012, when it recorded its highest showing at number 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53 percent over the past two decades," the authors said, noting that sharing meals "is strongly linked with well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, roughly one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone the previous day, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increasing number of people who eat alone is one reason for declining well-being in the United States," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted that the United States was one of few countries to see a rise of so-called "deaths of despair" – from suicide or substance abuse – at a time when those deaths are declining in a majority of countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report surveyed people worldwide in 2022-2024, before US President Donald Trump's shakeup of national and global affairs since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordic countries all stayed among the 10 happiest, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden trailing Finland, which slightly extended its lead over runner-up Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, at the sixth and 10th spot respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The happiness ranking is based on a three-year average of individuals' self-assessed evaluations of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity and corruption. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it fired rockets at Israeli commercial hub Tel Aviv on Thursday in its first military response to the growing civilian death toll from Israel's resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had closed off the territory's main north-south route as troops expanded the ground operations they resumed on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said 504 people had been killed so far in the Israeli assault this week, including more than 190 children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it fired rockets at Tel Aviv in response to Israel's "massacres" of Gaza civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it intercepted one projectile fired from Gaza and that two others struck an uninhabited area.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of stalemate, Israel resumed its air campaign early on Tuesday with a wave of deadly strikes that drew widespread condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offensive shattered a relative calm that had pervaded the war-ravaged Palestinian territory since a ceasefire took hold on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump "fully supports" Israel's deadly resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday when asked if he was trying to get a Gaza ceasefire back on track. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry became the first woman and African to be elected president of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday declaring it to be an "extraordinary moment."
 <br>
  <br>
  At 41, the two-time Olympic swimming champion is also the youngest ever elected to be the most powerful person in sports governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  She succeeds Thomas Bach, who steps down after 12 years, and said she would work with the six other heavyweight rivals she beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year-old girl I never thought that I would be standing up here one day, getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours," Coventry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not just a huge honour but it is a reminder to every single one of you that I will lead this organisation with so much pride, with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and, I hope, extremely confident in the decision you've taken today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coventry, who was strongly believed to be Bach's favoured candidate, was thought to be in a tight-run race with IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior and World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, to general surprise, the race was over after the first round of voting a majority of the 100-plus IOC members placing their faith in her to meet the serious challenges that lie ahead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages, a senior Beijing official told a visiting business delegation from the SAR on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comment during a meeting with representatives of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (EuroCham) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He appreciated EuroCham's positive assessment of China and the SAR, and praised its contributions in promoting long-term investment from European enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as cooperation between the city and the European business sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government firmly supports the accurate and resolute implementation of 'one country, two systems'...and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, while maintaining a free, open and rule-based business environment," an article published by the office read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, EuroCham told Xia that it has full confidence in Hong Kong, and pledged to bring in more investments, companies and talent from Europe to the SAR.

<img alt="Daichi Kamada's ninth goal for Japan sends the 60,000-strong crowd wild. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796672_1_20250320214131.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan became the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup after second-half goals from Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo gave them a 2-0 win over Bahrain on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The runaway Asian Group C leaders failed to sparkle on a chilly night in Saitama until Crystal Palace forward Kamada pounced for the opener in the 66th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo added another in the 87th minute as Japan punched their ticket to next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be their eighth straight World Cup appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's 5-1 home win over Indonesia earlier in the evening meant Japan would have clinched their place even with a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kamada made sure they did it in style in front of an expectant crowd of just under 60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He latched onto Kubo's reverse pass and dispatched the ball past Bahrain goalkeeper Ebrahim Lutfalla just three minutes after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Kubo added some extra gloss to the night with a left-footed shot from a tight angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's players sprinted onto the pitch at the final whistle and celebrated with the home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan have been in unstoppable form in the Asian third round of qualifiers and went into the game having won five and drawn one of their games so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Hajime Moriyasu started with an experienced line-up featuring Premier League talent in Liverpool's Wataru Endo and Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Endo thought he had given his team the lead in the ninth minute when he rammed home a loose ball in the box, only for the goal to be disallowed by VAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan continued to press for the opener but Bahrain had several dangerous raids on the counterattack and Komail Al Aswad should have done better just after the half-hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were also wasteful and Mitoma blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy in first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriyasu shuffled his pack midway through the second half, bringing on Kamada and Junya Ito for Takumi Minamino and Ritsu Doan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impact was immediate as Kamada gave Japan the lead with his ninth goal for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo went close to adding another with a curling shot that Lutfalla clawed away with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the attacker got his goal with time running out as Japan made sure of the win, and with it a place in North America. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong remains Asia's top financial hub, and third in the world behind New York and London, according to a half-yearly index of global financial centres.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singapore is ranked fourth, while Shanghai, Shenzhen and Seoul round up the top 10 spots in the 37th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The list is jointly compiled by think tanks Z/Yen Group in London and the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute. It is published every March and September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers ranked 119 financial centres based on 140 instrumental factors, as well as assessments from nearly 5,000 questionnaire respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR took top honours in the areas of investment management, insurance and finance, and was second in human capital and infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said the report fully recognises Hong Kong's "leading status and strengths" as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the staunch support of our country, Hong Kong will continue to leverage the advantages under 'one country, two systems', actively integrate into national development, and deepen international exchanges and co-operation, with a view to fulfilling our roles as a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder'," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also noted the latest budget has rolled out a series of policy initiatives to create new growth areas for the city's financial market.

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was set to address the summit by video link. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796668_1_20250320205411.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged EU leaders on Thursday to pledge 5 billion euros for artillery shells for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in peace talks, amid divergences over how to bolster Kyiv and the EU's own military capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Kallas called on leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with his efforts to end the war, including through a rapprochement with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas has scaled back a proposal to pledge up to 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine this year, with each country contributing according to its economic size, after resistance from some countries, particularly in southern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told reporters she was now focusing on what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was to address the summit by video link – says he needs most urgently, such as 2 million artillery shells at a cost of 5 billion euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should at least start to have a really concrete step – not only in words, but also in deeds that we are helping Ukraine right now. Because the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiating table," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering the EU's own defences also features on the summit agenda, reflecting deep fears that Moscow may attack an EU member in the coming years and doubts about the future of US protection for Europe via the Nato defence alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda reiterated his support to Kyiv on Thursday, saying "Ukraine needs our military assistance. Ukraine needs long-range missiles and we are ready to provide it. We should increase the pressure on Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the next victims of Russian aggression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some southern European capitals have been more reticent, reflecting a division between those geographically closer to Russia that have given more aid to Ukraine and those further away that have given less, as a share of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he did not like the term "rearm", which the European Commission has used extensively in its push for more defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank faces," he said. (Reuters)

    Inflation pace eases in February

<img alt="City's inflation eased last month, with prices for clothing and footwear products dropping by about two percent year on year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796632_1_20250320173703.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation pace eased last month, rising by just 1.4 percent year on year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 1.4 percent is notably lower compared with the two percent annual increase seen in January, according to official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday also showed that the underlying inflation rate, or the rate excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, rose 1.1 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is also lower compared with the 1.6 percent increase seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the slower pace of inflation was mainly due to the timing of last year's Lunar New Year festival, which fell in February, creasing a high base for comparison for this year, especially in regards to food prices and the costs of package tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  By categories, the biggest price spikes were seen in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, with the inflation gauge for this segment rising 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's followed by the price increase for gas and water, as the inflation rate for the category rose 13.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Products that saw price declines were clothing and footwear, basic food, and durable goods, with their rates dropping between one and two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the city's overall inflation will remain moderate in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs pressures might increase somewhat as the economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain broadly in check, though uncertainties stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts continue to warrant attention," the spokesperson said.

 China said on Thursday it acted in accordance with the law over the execution of four Canadian citizens in recent weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in Ottawa on Wednesday that China had executed four Canadian citizens in recent weeks, defying pleas from Ottawa for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the executions that did happen against Canadians in China," Joly said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she was unable to discuss details of the case due to privacy requests from the families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing suggested on Thursday the Canadians had been convicted over narcotics offences, saying "... combating drug crimes is the common responsibility of all countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is a country under the rule of law," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing, she said, "treats defendants of different nationalities equally without discrimination" and "handles cases fairly in strict accordance with the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  China "protects the legitimate rights of the parties concerned as well as the consular rights of the Canadian side, in accordance with the law," Mao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also defended the executions in a statement sent to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognised worldwide as extremely harmful to the society," the embassy statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a 'zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 CK Hutchison has reported a 27 percent drop in net profit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Full-year earnings reached HK$17 billion in 2024, down from HK$23.5 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole, the Group's underlying operating results were relatively stable" last year despite a one-time issue related to its Vietnam telecommunications business, chairman Victor Li said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for 2025, Li said the operating environment for the group's businesses is expected to be "volatile and unpredictable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company announced a final dividend of HK$1.514 per share, compared with HK$1.775 the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conglomerate recently proposed selling its ports business, including assets near the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew criticism from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison did not hold a post-earnings press conference on Thursday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

 Stocks mostly rose on Thursday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell suggested any increase in consumer prices caused by tariffs would likely be short-lived, even as the central bank slashed its growth outlook and hiked inflation expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three main indexes on Wall Street rallied.
  <br>
  <br>
  And most of Asia followed suit, with Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei, Mumbai, Bangkok, Wellington and Manila all up.
