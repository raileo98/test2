 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

    Xi briefed on plans to achieve HK fiscal balance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he detailed to President Xi Jinping strategies to achieve fiscal balance "in three to five years", after the SAR government warned the deficit would balloon to around HK$100 billion for the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who was received by the president on the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, added the administration will aim to develop new growth points and grasp the opportunities provided by the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the CE was asked if the president was concerned by the SAR government's fiscal situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have explained the strategies that we will be adopting to ensure that we will eventually make a balanced budget. That may take a few years," Lee replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said one way to strengthen the city's economy would be "expanding outside" to markets like Asean and the Middle East, or even Latin America and central Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nation still offers "the biggest opportunities" for Hong Kong, Lee stressed, and that it's up to the SAR to capitalise on them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee revealed he and the president also discussed safeguarding national security, raising the level of governance, boosting development momentum, and improving people's livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a brief photo call at the start of the closed-door meeting, Xi had affirmed Lee's work and hailed his administration for completing the "historic legislation" of Basic Law Article 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that recognition speaks for itself. I am a believer of there is never the best, only the better. That is also the doctrine advocated by President Xi. In this area, we see things in the same angle," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I have been making reports to him as to how I can create extra synergy, new development, and also create economic growth for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will meet officials from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in Beijing on Saturday, before returning to the SAR on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee hoped the exchange would provide insight to a recently established SAR committee on education, technology and talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group, announced in his policy address, is chaired by the chief secretary.

    France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist leader Francois Bayrou as prime minister, handing him the daunting task of hauling France out of months of political crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou, the 73-year-old head of the MoDem group which is allied to Macron's party, was appointed nine days after Michel Barnier's government was ousted by parliament in a historic no-confidence vote following a standoff over an austerity budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President of the Republic has appointed Mr Francois Bayrou as prime minister and tasked him with forming a government," the French presidency said in a statement, giving no more details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou is the sixth prime minister of Macron's mandate after last week's toppling of Barnier, who became France's shortest-serving prime minister and lasted only three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also Macron's fourth prime minister of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou now faces an immediate challenge in putting together a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence vote in a deeply divided parliament and thrash out a 2025 budget in a bid to limit economic turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Macron received Bayrou for nearly two hours of talks Friday. BFMTV reported the talks with Bayrou had been "tense".
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier, 73, was expected to hand over power to his successor at a ceremony late on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England were placed in a group with Serbia as the draw for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Europe took place on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As they prepare to begin life under new coach Thomas Tuchel, England were also drawn alongside Albania, Latvia and Andorra in the five-team Group K.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matches will take place between March and November next year, with the group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runners-up in each of the 12 qualifying groups will get a second chance via a series of play-offs, with Europe now contributing a total of 16 nations to the expanded 48-team competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact make-up of the groups is not yet completely clear as it depends on the outcome of the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties will see reigning European champions Spain face the Netherlands, while Germany play Italy, Portugal take on Denmark and France meet Croatia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups in which these teams end up depend on whether they win and progress to the Nations League semi-finals next June, or are eliminated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are six groups of five teams who will begin qualifying in March, while the six groups of four teams will only start next September. (AFP)

    Stiffer penalties mooted for major illegal structures

<img alt="The government is proposing tougher penalties for serious illegal structures, while offering leniency for smaller works such as oversized drying racks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783391_1_20241213191930.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday a two-fold proposal to handle unauthorised building works, with those convicted of serious breaches facing a maximum jail term of two years and a HK$2 million fine.
 <br>
  <br>
  While stiffer penalties could be introduced for serious contraventions of the Buildings Ordinance, authorities are also rolling out a leniency scheme for minor unlawful works deemed to be low risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau conducted a review of the existing regulations following a spate of incidents where chunks of concrete fell off the exterior facade of ageing buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was also public concern after a landslide exposed unauthorised structures at multiple Redhill Peninsula villas last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Buildings Ordinance, those who ignore removal orders for "serious unauthorised works", such as an illegal basement, could be jailed for two years, double the current ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum fine would also be raised by 50 percent to HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Owners, building professionals or contractors who erect structures without government approval even face a HK$2 million fine, up from HK$400,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also proposing to lower the prosecution threshold, such that proceedings could be initiated even when the person concerned doesn't "knowingly" begin construction without permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who inherit illegal structures from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain time frame after the new law is passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatively minor additions, including retractable awnings and outdoor signboards fixed to the floor, could be performed without prior approval in the future so long as the structures fit the prescribed size and height.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also plan to relax requirements for drying racks for clothes and air conditioner support frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a three-year grace period for owners to have minor structures inspected by a certified professional. Structures which are approved can be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokeswoman said the policy is aimed at minimising nuisance to the public. But the bureau was also aware of opinions that existing laws are not deterrent enough for serious breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, our resources are limited. So we want to focus our law enforcement efforts on the most serious cases, tackling the bigger illegal structures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which are served to premises aged 30 years or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal will begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Friday said Hong Kong needs more long-term planning in connecting its development strategy with that of the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said President Xi Jinping showed affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration during their exchanges in Beijing on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultant said Lee was awarded with a high evaluation due to the SAR completing national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law earlier this year, and its efforts in building ties with different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think particularly [President Xi is] concerned about Hong Kong's international development space, which has been, to a certain extent, shrunk by the United States and the West," Lau told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why President Xi must be happy to see John Lee and his government trying to develop, or to enlarge, Hong Kong's international economic space by developing closer relationships with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi was optimistic on Hong Kong's economy, and he expects "reform" and "innovation" to be the major principles for the city's future governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that it would require long-term planning so that Hong Kong could connect its development strategy with that of the mainland's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan also departed for Beijing to join the chief executive in meeting with relevant ministries in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi may want Hong Kong to boost its inter-departmental cooperation and also work with the central government to tackle external threats as US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That might involve a bigger impact on Hong Kong, and may also involve Hong Kong cooperating with the central authorities so that we can jointly handle the threats coming from Trump and his new administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Lee meeting leaders from universities in Beijing, Lau said Hong Kong has to strengthen its exchanges with mainland universities to further enable the city to serve as an educational hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Friday said Russia launched a massive aerial attack against the country's energy infrastructure, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as one of the heaviest bombardments on the country's energy sector since the war began almost three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian defences shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes, according to Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A strong reaction from the world is needed,” Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to disrupt civilian life and Ukrainian defence manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest attack comes as uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether American military support for Kyiv will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said on Friday that Trump's opposition to Ukraine firing US-supplied weapons deep into Russia "fully aligned" with Moscow's position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statement fully aligns with our position, with our view on the reasons for escalation. It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry says it carried out the attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in retaliation for Kyiv's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said that air- and sea-based long-range precision weapons and drones were used against "critical facilities of Ukraine's fuel and energy infrastructure that support the military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar massive attack on November 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia also said on Friday that discussions of possibly deploying European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine to guarantee a future ceasefire were premature, and added it wanted peace rather than simply a truce. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has praised Chief Executive John Lee for implementing the city’s domestic national security law and shoring up the global influence of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi, who received Lee on Friday during the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, also said the central government fully recognised the work of the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the past year, you have led the SAR government to be responsible and pragmatic in completing the historic legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, focusing on economic development and promoting solutions to people’s livelihood issues such as housing and healthcare,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have strengthened external exchanges and cooperation, which not only enhanced the international influence [of Hong Kong], but also further consolidated the great momentum of Hong Kong’s stable development. The central government fully affirms your work and that of the SAR government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said central authorities fully support the SAR government in leading Hong Kong to seek reforms and make greater contributions to the city’s prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee thanked Xi for his continued care and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the halfway point of the term for the current government. It is a critical period for leading Hong Kong to move forward, and to inherit the past and usher in the future. It is also an important moment to make great contributions to the building of a great country through Chinese modernisation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has seen results in different areas over the past two and half years, Lee said, with global rankings of the city reflecting the confidence in the SAR and proving that the policy direction is correct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the senior leaders at the meeting were Premier Li Qiang; Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang; and Cai Qi, director of the central committee’s general office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong were also present.

 The Hang Seng Index ended the week on Friday sharply lower, finishing down 2.09 percent to close at 19,971, its biggest decline in a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday proposed amendments to road traffic regulations to improve road safety and keep up with new technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the changes is requiring electric vehicles to have acoustic warning systems to alert pedestrians. Private cars will also need to use child restraining devices, while vehicles with extendable aerial structures must have over-height warning systems installed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals also include allowing remote control parking features and camera-monitor systems as alternatives to traditional mirrors. Electric commercial vehicles will also be permitted to use expressways without special permits under the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a Transport and Logistics Bureau spokesman said the government will continue updating regulations as needed to keep pace with evolving technologies and international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to create a safer and more convenient road environment for road users in Hong Kong through optimising vehicle design and construction standards with the amendment regulations," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments will be tabled to the Legislative Council next Wednesday for negative vetting.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said he saw "encouraging signs" of progress towards a ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza Strip on a visit to Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about the imperative of Hamas saying 'yes' to the agreement that's possible, to finally help bring this to an end. And we appreciate very much the role that Turkey can play in using its voice with Hamas to try to bring this to conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire [in Gaza] in place. And what we've seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that is possible," Blinken said after meeting Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two diplomats also discussed the situation in Syria which is in a state of flux following the fall of president Bashar al-Assad last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidan said that possible Turkish and US roles for Syria's future were among the topics they discussed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Turkey's priority in Syria is ensuring the stability and prevention of domination by groups deemed terrorists after the ouster of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken said it was "imperative" to work against a resurgence of the Islamic State group in Syria post-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country worked very hard... to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that that threat doesn't rear its head again. And it's imperative that we keep at those efforts," Blinken said in Ankara at a press conference with Fidan. (Agencies)

    Communication vital when medical incidents occur: HA

<img alt="The Hospital Authority says good communication procedures are essential when handling crises and reporting incidents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783350_1_20241213155420.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said training its spokespersons on how to communicate with the public and family members after medical incidents occur is necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  This recommendation of setting up a spokesperson preparedness programme comes from a review committee tasked with improving the authority’s management, which put forward various suggestions last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration had earlier ordered the authority to review its management following a spate of medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told a Legco panel meeting on Friday that it’s impossible to avoid medical incidents entirely, highlighting the incident rate in Hong Kong is much lower than in other advanced healthcare systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority’s chief executive, added that proper communication to avoid misunderstanding is more important.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must understand that adverse clinical outcomes do happen. That is the same everywhere. The point is to communicate the incident well to the public, the family members and our internal staff members to be transparent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On this, we think training is needed. Most of the time, we focus our training on medical training. So there's room for improvements in terms of communication skills. That's why we will follow up on this recommendation seriously.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the other recommendations put forward by the review committee is for a high-level reform committee, which will be formed and led by the HA’s chairman Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers asked the HA for a clear timeline on the committee's formation and whether legislators could get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the HA has begun its work on this issue, noting that no more details can be given at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liberal Party lawmaker Peter Shiu, who's also a former Eastern District Council member, expressed concern about the authority’s plan to merge the Western and Eastern Hong Kong Island hospital clusters, saying he’s heard people worry that some hospitals would be shut down after the integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo assured the legislator that hospital services will remain unaffected, noting the cluster is designed to cater to the population distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In 2041, there should be 8.5 million people in Hong Kong. A cluster would serve one-seventh of the population. So I think that is necessary for us to review and make adjustment. By integrating the two clusters, the Eastern Hospital services will not be affected. There could even be improvement because upon integration, the management and administrative efficiency will be enhanced,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel’s chair Chan Hoi-yan, for her part, raised concerns over the rising expenditure of the HA, noting the authority will receive over HK$95 billion in subsidies this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo mentioned that healthcare expenditures make up only 3.9 percent of the SAR’s GDP, which is quite low by global standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister said Hong Kong is well-known for the cost-effectiveness of its healthcare system, but also noted that an ageing population and implementation of new healthcare technologies are putting a strain on finances.

 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will decide whether and when to conduct military exercises in accordance with its needs and the situation on the ground, a defence spokesperson said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks when responding to media questions on military drills following Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's recent transit through Hawaii and Guam, emphasising the PLA's unwavering resolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu reaffirmed the PLA's mission to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and defend the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any attempt to split the nation through soliciting external support or resorting to force will be punished, and will never succeed," Wu said. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to subsidise taxi drivers to help them install surveillance cameras while providing more education for cabbies struggling to adapt to new electronic payment systems.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows a legislative proposal to require taxi drivers to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026, and implement electronic payment methods by late 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel on Friday, newly appointed transport minister Mable Chan said the proposal had been well-received by the public and the taxi trade.
  <br>

  "We are proposing a win-win situation for passengers, taxi drivers as well as the entire taxi trade. We will be able to enable all passengers to have a better travelling experience with these systems. We will also be able to increase the deterrent effect for the black sheep in the trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Ryan Wong who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi Council, said he’s worried about rising operational costs and urged the government to consider subsidising CCTV camera installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said while the industry generally welcomes introducing e-payment means, some taxi drivers may not be familiar with digital platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some drivers may not be very familiar with using these platforms, which is a bit worrying. But we believe that through education and even workshops to provide information, this problem can be solved," he told reporters before the panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick said he doesn't think privacy is an issue as the government has implemented a system in which camera footage can only be accessed by authorised personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at all other public transport in Hong Kong, they already have a CCTV camera there. So I think you have to remember, even within the taxi cab, it's not a totally private place. It's semi-private. So I think the most important thing is to make sure the passengers are aware that the CCTV system is on," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton stars Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet on Friday crashed out of the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, falling to the national team's Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin in three games.
 <br>
  <br>
  That result could be the end of the road for the SAR pair, with Tse having already hinted at retirement earlier this year as she continues to battle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei pulled ahead late to win the opening game, 21-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Tang and Tse to bounce back, though, claiming a nail-biting 21-19 victory in the second to force a winner-take-all third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by six at the break, the SAR pair put up a fight by scoring six straight points to cut the deficit at 14-11.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jiang and Wei pulled away to seal a 21-15 victory to round out the 63 minute match-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong duo finished group play with one win and two losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei will join compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in the knockout round, which begins on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest chess world champion on Thursday after beating defending champion Ding Liren of China in the final match of their series in Singapore.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju, 18, secured 7.5 points against 6.5 of his Chinese rival in the contest, surpassing the achievement of Russia’s Garry Kasparov who won the title at the age of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian teen prodigy has long been considered a rising star in the chess world after he became a chess grandmaster at 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had entered the match as the youngest-ever challenger to the world crown after winning the Candidates tournament earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After securing victory, Dommaraju burst into tears and raised his arms in celebration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years. I am happy that I realised the dream (and made it) into reality,” he told reporters after his win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju is now the second Indian to win the title after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand, who has been a mentor to Dommaraju, said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the 18-year-old on his “remarkable accomplishment,” calling it “the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s match was a 14-round long-time classical event with a prize fund of US$2.5 million. (AP)

 A memorial ceremony was held in Nanjing on Friday in honour of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mourners gathered at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders to remember those killed by invading Japanese forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers placed numerous large floral wreaths on stage, before the national anthem was played and a moment of silence held to a lowered national flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed during the six-week massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as National Memorial Day, to ensure the massacre is not forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, there are only 32 living registered survivors of the massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1945, the war against Japan came to an end as Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender in the Second World War. (Agencies)

 Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan, along with other senior government officials, members from the legislative and executive councils on Friday paid tribute to the more than 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre between 1937 and 1938.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the ceremony at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, the national anthem was played before a two-minute moment of silence was observed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)

    'Impeachment best way to restore order'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Friday that the best way to restore order in the country is to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol, a day ahead of a planned parliamentary vote over Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A vote by South Korea's parliament on whether to impeach President Yoon over his martial law decree has been moved to 4pm on Saturday, the speaker's office said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the national significance and gravity of the matter, the plenary session was finalised for 4pm to allow adequate time for thorough discussions and consultations," the National Assembly Speaker's Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's move to impose military rule on December 3 was rescinded before six hours but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon on Thursday vowed to "fight to the end," blaming the opposition party for paralysing the government and claiming a North Korean hack into the election commission made his party's crushing defeat in an April parliamentary election questionable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee called Yoon's remarks "a declaration of war" against the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It proved that impeachment is the fastest and the most effect way to end the confusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon survived the first attempt to impeach him last Saturday when most of his ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then some PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They need at least eight PPP members to join to pass the bill with the two-third majority required. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has invited President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to kick off trading for the day, that he had been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration” without referring to any specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came soon after his incoming White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed during a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends” that Trump had invited Xi and other world leaders to attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  No head of state has previously made an official visit to the US for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented invitations come at a moment when much of the world is bracing for what comes next when Trump and his “America First” world view return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has vowed to levy massive tariffs against the United States' chief economic competitor, China, as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico - citing illegal immigration and illegal drugs as a factor in his decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danny Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said President Xi would not allow himself to “be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded, “I have nothing to share at present.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s January 20 inauguration is set to take place a day after the US deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City captain Kyle Walker has called for tough action to tackle online abuse after he received a "vile, racist and threatening" message following Wednesday's 2-0 loss at Juventus.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walker played the whole European Champions League match in Turin but could not help Pep Guardiola's team avoid a seventh defeat in 10 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international posted a screenshot of a message he received on Instagram from an unnamed user to his social media accounts on Thursday that used obscene racist language.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one should ever be subjected to the sort of vile, racist and threatening abuse I have received online since last night's match," Walker wrote on his X and Instagram accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instagram and the authorities need to stop this happening for the sake of all who are suffering this abuse – it is never acceptable," he went on to say. "To our fans, we will continue to work as a team to do better, to improve and to turn the corner together."
  <br>
  <br>
  City condemned the racist attack. A club statement read: "Manchester City strongly condemns the racist abuse that Kyle Walker was subject to online following last night's fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We refuse to tolerate discrimination of any kind – regardless of whether that be in stadiums or online," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League also weighed in, saying in a statement that "racism has no place in the game or anywhere in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage anyone who hears or sees discriminatory abuse to report it so action can be taken," it wrote. "The Premier League will support Kyle Walker and the club to tackle online hate." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund fired Manchester United to a 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League as Chelsea beat Astana 3-1 in the Europa Conference League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's United side came from behind to best the Czech side thanks to a second-half brace by Danish striker Hojlund, provisionally moving to fifth in the league phase standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top eight finish will see United qualify automatically for the round of 16, while finishing ninth to 24th will earn them a play-off tie to reach that stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matej Vydra opened the scoring three minutes after half-time to stun United, before substitute Hojlund scored twice in the last half-hour to seize a vital three points for the English club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner came two minutes from time when Bruno Fernandes cleverly slipped a free-kick into the 21-year-old's feet and he held off a defender before slipping home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Europa League, Roma beat 10-man Braga 3-0 thanks to goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Saud Abdulhamid and Mario Hermoso to move to 12th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic Bilbao top the standings with 16 points after beating Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 2-0 on Wednesday courtesy of an Inaki Williams double.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a much-changed Chelsea side battled the frigid conditions in Kazakhstan and won to all but guarantee a top-eight finish in the league phase, which would ensure automatic qualification to the round of 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a solid performance," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. "We knew it was quite cold – we tried to adapt quickly. The players did fantastically with the weather conditions and long journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea sit top of the standings on 15 points, three ahead of Fiorentina in second and Legia Warsaw who lost to Switzerland's Lugano to break their perfect record in the competition. (AFP)

 Swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Friday finished fourth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong swimmer finished her two laps with a time of 51.41 seconds, more than a full second behind first-place American Gretchen Walsh who took gold with a 50.31-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beryl Gastaldello of France clocked in a time of 50.63 seconds for the silver medal, while 14-time Championships medallist Kate Douglass claimed bronze at 50.73 seconds.

  Haughey, 27, qualified for the final after coming in fifth overall in yesterday's semi-finals, where she recorded a time of 51.83 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Haughey is the 200-metre freestyle on Sunday, where she will be looking to defend her title as she competes in what will be one of her last races before going on hiatus.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US equity markets dipped fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq retreating below 20,000 following a US inflation report that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US wholesale inflation came in at 0.4 percent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 percent in October and higher than projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the inflation report, markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we're seeing profit-taking after a big day," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research, who viewed the inflation report as unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dropped 0.7 percent to 19,902.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 percent to 43,914.12, while the S&P 500 also shed 0.5 percent to 6,051.25.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock indices have scored repeat records since Donald Trump won the November 5 presidential election. The Republican took a victory lap on Thursday morning, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Adobe tumbled 13.7 percent on disappointment over the software giant's forecast for next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Warner Bros. Discovery surged 15.4 percent as it announced a reorganization, with one major division focused on operating television networks and the other focused on streaming and movie studios. (AFP)

 The West Kowloon Cultural District is bringing the holiday spirit to life with the opening of its Christmas Market, which is set to run until December 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The market features around 30 specialty stalls selling a wide variety of festive treats, drinks and holiday gifts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jenny, a visitor to the market, said she’s enjoying the bustling atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since it's been this lively," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victoria, a student from Germany, said she loves the live music performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice because it makes for a good atmosphere, you can just sit and talk to your friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stall owners at the market, meanwhile, said they hope the event will attract large crowds and thus boost their sales.

 The government said it has submitted requests to extend the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and are awaiting approval from the mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The requests include overnight service at the Shenzhen Bay port and extended hours at the Lo Wu checkpoint until 2am from the current 12am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Huanggang checkpoints will operate round the clock as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s inter-departmental working group on festival arrangements held a meeting on Thursday ahead of the upcoming festive period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

 Cathay Group announced on Thursday that additional flights and destinations will be introduced in the upcoming year, as part of its two-year rebuilding plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the group said Cathay Pacific and its sister airline, HK Express, will return to 100 percent pre-pandemic capacity by January.
  <br>

  It added that the two airlines will expand their passenger services to 100 global destinations by the end of next year.

  “With the commissioning of the Three-Runway System last month, Hong Kong has entered into an exciting new era,” it wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As the city’s home airline, we look forward to doing our part to elevate Hong Kong’s status as a world-leading international aviation hub, connecting Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and the world.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers over the next six weeks in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

    Plaza Hollywood cinema likely to close on Friday

<img alt="Many people said they have fond memories of the cinema in Plaza Hollywood. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783222_1_20241212190641.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cinema in Diamond Hill will likely cease operations on Friday, potentially becoming the seventh movie theatre to close this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Even though the MCL branch at Plaza Hollywood hasn’t made an official announcement yet, the cinema has suspended ticket-selling on its website and its ticket counters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanning 38,000 square feet, the cinema has six halls with a total capacity of almost 1,600 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  While staff members at the cinema refused to comment on the reported closure, they conceded that "operation of the cinema will temporarily pause from Friday".
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those paying a potential last visit to MCL Cinemas PLUS+ Plaza Hollywood was Shaun, a university student.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe because of people heading north or the internet is growing fast, not many people are coming to the cinemas. But I love watching movies inside cinemas, that's why I'm quite distressed," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diana, who’s lived in the housing complex above the mall for over two decades, said the cinema means a lot to her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just get in the lift and come here within ten minutes. It's very convenient ...it's very causal and easy,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, during my childhood, my parents often brought me to watch movies during the weekends and so this is a habit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another nearby resident, 76-year-old Raymond, said he’s been a big fan of the cinema.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's such a pity. There's only this cinema in the area. I am an elderly and this cinema offers discounts for senior citizens until 1:30pm. I once watched five movies in a week," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least six cinemas have closed this year, including the almost six-decade old President Theatre in Causeway Bay.

    Bulgaria and Romania fully integrated into Schengen

<img alt="Bulgaria and Romania are now fully integrated into Europe's vast Schengen area of free movement. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783219_1_20241212184750.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union ministers on Thursday agreed to let Bulgaria and Romania fully integrate into Europe’s ID-check free travel zone, known as the Schengen area, by lifting land border controls from next year, the EU's Hungarian presidency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria and Romania joined the Schengen area in March after years of negotiations, providing free access for travellers arriving in both countries by air or sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, land border checks remained in place due to opposition, chiefly from Austria, over concerns the two countries were not doing enough to prevent migrants from entering without authorisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Interior ministers have just adopted a decision to lift internal land border controls with and between Bulgaria and Romania,” the Hungarian presidency posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A great victory for Bulgaria, Romania, and all of Europe!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Land border checks will end from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania’s Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the decision would be a “major benefit” to his country’s economy and enable “faster journeys home for the millions of Romanians” living and travelling within the Schengen area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freedom of movement is central to European integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 420 million people live in the Schengen area, and their freedom to move across borders helps businesses and tourism to flourish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romanian President Klaus Lohannis called it a “natural and necessary step” that will significantly reduce wait times at borders, lower logistical costs for businesses, and raise attractiveness to foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Schengen membership has been a strategic objective for our country,” he said in a statement. “Over time, there have been numerous obstacles, despite Romania’s technical readiness to meet Schengen standards for many years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Romania would “continue to act responsibly to protect and strengthen the EU’s external borders” to manage illegal migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Schengen Area was established in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Bulgaria and Romania’s partial admission, it comprised 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 3.5 million people cross an internal border each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the main achievements of the European project.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started as an intergovernmental project between five EU countries– France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and has gradually expanded to become the largest free travel area in the world. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants were on Thursday convicted of rioting in Yuen Long during the 2019 protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty for their roles in clashes inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21 that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his verdict, District Court judge Stanley Chan said the former Democratic Party lawmaker had "fanned the flames" by going to the station and asking his assistant to livestream the events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecution had said that the defendant was using his capacity as a legislator to lead a group of protesters to provoke a rival group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, 47, had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been serving a separate sentence of six years and nine months for subversion, for his role in an unsanctioned Legco primary.

    Surge in cases involving impersonation of officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday reported a surge in cases involving the impersonation of officials, with nearly 900 scams reported in the initial 10 months of this year, marking a 12 percent increase from the previous period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they received 874 cases that amounted to HK$1.42 billion, more than double from previous figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Theodora Lee, the superintendent at the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said that 30 percent of victims were university students, adding that scammers have adopted novel tactics to deceive people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers are getting more aggressive. In recent cases, we have seen scammers demanding students to take nude photos or videos and hide in remote areas. In one case, they even requested a victim leave Hong Kong for Thailand and cut off contact with their families," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tactics were aimed at pressuring the students' parents for more money."
  <br>
  <br>
  One victim who is a master's student in the SAR said she travelled to the mainland, and handed over 500,000 yuan in cash to the scammers, after she was informed by scammers dressed in police uniforms with identification that she was involved in a money laundering case.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was then directed to Thailand, where she was told she was prohibited from contacting anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the scammers later falsely informed her parents that she had been kidnapped and demanded a 10 million yuan ransom.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her parents reported the incident, and she was eventually found in a Bangkok hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there were 36,405 cases of fraud from January to October this year, involving a sum of over HK$7 billion.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

    'HK exports to see 4 percent growth in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.

  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The captain of Hong Kong, China men's team, James Christie, on Thursday said the squad would be looking to build on their recent success in Asia as they enter the final stretch of training in the run-up to the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having been named as the successor to Max Woodward in September, Christie weighed in on what the opportunity to lead Hong Kong meant to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always said I'm not much of a talker," Christie said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not much difference between being a player and a captain – I need to lead from the front a bit more, but I like to lead through the games and matches that I play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, 28, has already tasted early success in leading the SAR to a clean sweep of victories during the Asia Rugby Sevens Series this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the SAR defeated Japan in the final of the last leg of the tournament in Thailand, repeating its earlier successes in China and South Korea, to become the first side to win all of its 15 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Christie said the team's eyes are on the bigger prize on home soil, as the annual tournament makes its debut at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge motivation, the new facilities look fantastic," said Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking forward to running out a new spot with a new team and new faces, so hopefully, it'll be all good."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also added that fitness, skills, and cohesion are major aspects that the team are looking to polish up on ahead of the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chloe Chan, the new co-captain of the women's side, said she wants to encourage her teammates on and off the field, to ensure that the team bonds well together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really want our team to come together and perform and do well in the Challenger Series," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for veteran co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne, she said she's looking forward to working with a new partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chloe Chan has actually been on the leadership group for quite a while, so she has stepped up. She's been a leader multiple times before, so I see it going quite smoothly," Olson-Thorne told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She's got a lot of experience and a lot of positivity leading into the team environment."

    Ceiling for severance pay could be as high as HK$200k

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has proposed that employees who lose their jobs after their companies go bankrupt can get as much as HK$200,000 of severance pay - double the current ceiling.
 <br>
  <br>
  They will also get half of any more money owed to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ex-gratia payments, that are made by the government's Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), also cover unpaid wages, pay for untaken annual leave and statutory holidays, as well as payment in lieu of notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said it expects the move to allow 86 percent of the applicants to obtain their severance payment in full.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With an average of some 3,000 applications received annually and an accumulated surplus of over HK$7.2 billion as at December 2023, PWIF was financially sound enough to cope with the possible increase in applications,” it reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, Lam Chun-sing, chairman of the Legislative Council's manpower panel said he welcomed the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one abuses the fund, I think the number of applications will remain similar at around 3,000 cases each year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when the economy is poor, I think there will be only 4,000 to 5,000 cases. To a fund that has more than HK$7 billion, it's financially sound in the long run."
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the Legco panel on manpower are set to discuss the matter on Monday.

    HKGCC predicts 2.3% GDP growth in 2025

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC) on Thursday predicted real GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2025, along with a headline inflation rate of 2.0 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman Agnes Chan said this was a cautiously optimistic prediction, and expressed confidence in central government and SAR government measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC said that in a survey it carried out last month, more than 60 percent of 219 companies questioned reported increased or stable business turnover this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 18 percent said they had a positive outlook for the local economy in the next 12 months, while 45 percent held a negative view.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Doris Fung said that many unpredictable factors can be behind the firms' worries, such as uncertain growth rates in Europe and the potential for a trade war following Donald Trump's re-election as US president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are also confident in the Hong Kong business community, they are more prepared this time with the new US government," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that about half of the companies do not plan to either hire or cut staff, and about 40 percent plan to increase salaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 60 percent of the respondents said they don't expect to change their capital investment plans over the next year, the HKGCC said.

 The Houston Rockets edged Golden State 91-90 for their first win over the Warriors since 2020, as they reach the semi-finals of the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teammate Jalen Green's 12 points, including the game-winning free-throws with 3.5 seconds remaining, helped Houston end a run of 15 straight losses to the Warriors stretching back to February 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets booked an NBA Cup last-four showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Atlanta Hawks, fueled by 22 points and 11 assists from Trae Young, erased a 10-point third-quarter deficit to beat the New York Knicks 108-100 and book an NBA Cup semi-final against the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hawks point guard Young, the player Knicks fans have loved to hate since Atlanta's 2021 playoff series triumph over New York, came alive in the second half to get the Hawks offense firing after the Knicks dominated the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored 12 points and handed out nine assists after the break, directing a balanced Hawks attack that was led by 24 points from forward De'Andre Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big game, especially for us," Young said after the Hawks punched their ticket to the NBA Cup final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just try to play for each other and play til the end, and that's what we did." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resources company on Thursday said the hiring intentions of local companies will be more conservative in the first quarter of next year, amid a slowdown of the global economy and geopolitical tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  ManpowerGroup said it interviewed about 500 local employers and around 35 percent thought they would increase staff numbers in the coming three months, while 28 percent said they would need to downsize.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior vice president with the group, Lancy Chui, said some sectors will face challenges, including goods and services and transport and logistics, due to a change in consumption patterns and tax-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said various policies and events will be favourable for some sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents will be an opportunity. Also, Hong Kong is now promoting a mega event economy. This will stimulate local and tourist consumption. It's also the peak season for festive spending, so it will boost the atmosphere for consumption," Chui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said the employment outlook for the first quarter of next year stands at +6%, marking a two percentage point drop when compared with this quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economic officials in outgoing US President Joe Biden's administration are set to meet their Chinese counterparts this week for talks, in a final effort to strengthen ties before Donald Trump's White House return.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks come as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed in an interview on Wednesday the need for "ongoing communications at all levels" to avoid needless worsening in relations between the world's two biggest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economic and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have continued to flare during Biden's time in office. But temperatures could rise further under Trump, who has threatened sweeping tariff increases on Chinese goods ahead of his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's critical to have open channels of communication," Yellen told Bloomberg Television, warning that Trump's universal tariffs proposal would likely trigger retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh is due to meet Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min for an economic working group meeting on the sidelines of Group of 20 talks in South Africa, said the US Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States and China are the two largest economies on the globe, and the American people expect that we should be able to communicate directly with Chinese officials on both areas where we agree and especially on areas where we don't," said Shambaugh.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury officials and representatives from other agencies will travel to the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing as well, for a financial working group meeting taking place on Sunday and Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's delegation is expected to be headed by People's Bank of China deputy governor Xuan Changneng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect US clean energy businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The notice from the US Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50 percent and duties on certain tungsten products will increase to 25 percent, effective on January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains,” US Trade Representative Katharine Tai said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the US of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the US. (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's new interim prime minister pledged to protect minority rights as Washington's top diplomat flew to the region on Thursday to urge an "inclusive" transition after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mohammad al-Bashir has said he will only remain in power until March.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new coalition of rebel groups has yet to spell out key details of the transition process, including its thinking on a new constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are bringing (ministers) from one colour, there should be participation of others," said Zakaria Malahifji, secretary general of the Syrian National Movement who once served as political advisor to rebels in Aleppo. He said the lack of consultation in forming an interim government was a misstep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syrian society is diverse in terms of cultures, ethnicities, so frankly this is concerning," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria last Sunday after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies, which brought a spectacular end to five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrians across the country and around the world erupted in celebration after enduring decades during which suspected dissidents were jailed or killed, and nearly 14 years of war that killed 500,000 people and displaced millions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joy sparked by Assad's overthrow has been accompanied by uncertainty about the future of the multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its new rulers have sought to reassure minorities they will be protected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunni Muslim HTS is rooted in Syria's branch of Al-Qaeda and is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many Western governments, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria," Mohammad al-Bashir, the transitional head of government until March 1, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new rulers have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad's iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani vowing that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa, also urged "countries to hand over any of those criminals who may have fled so they can be brought to justice".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top US diplomat Antony Blinken is on Thursday in Jordan, his first stop on a regional tour that will see him offer American support for "an inclusive, Syrian-led transition to an accountable and representative government," State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will call for Syria to avoid becoming a "base of terrorism" or "posing a threat to its neighbours" -- a nod to the concerns of Turkey and Israel, both of which have carried out strikes inside Syria since Assad's fall. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifa on Wednesday confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, underlining the Gulf kingdom's growing influence in world sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, a virtual Congress of world football's governing body confirmed that Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be joint hosts of the 2030 World Cup, in which three games will also be played in South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid was waved through by acclamation during the meeting of Fifa's 211 national member associations, with no rivals standing in its way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a proud day, a day of celebration, a day that we invite the entire world to Saudi Arabia," said Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We intend to have an extraordinary version of the World Cup in our kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to condemnation from rights groups, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said his organisation is inclusive and non-discriminatory. “We want to obtain positive social impact," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of course aware of critics and fears, and I fully trust our hosts to address all open points from this process and deliver a Fifa World Cup which meets expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "social improvements and positive human rights impacts" are "responsibilities of hosting a World Cup". (AFP)

<img alt="President Yoon Suk Yeol's inner circle has come under intense scrutiny for their role in last week's martial law declaration. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783127_2_20241212091257.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean president on Thursday defended his martial law decree as an act of governance and denied rebellion charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  In televised remarks, Yoon Suk Yeol lashed out at his political opponents as "anti-state forces", said North Korea has hacked the country's elections and defended his short-lived martial law order as a legal move to protect democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came hours before the main liberal opposition Democratic Party submits a new impeachment motion against him. The opposition party plans to put the motion on a floor vote this Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the address, Yoon vowed to "fight with the people until the very last minute".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I apologise again to the people who must have been surprised and anxious due to the martial law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Please trust me in my warm loyalty to the people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition’s earlier attempt to impeach Yoon fell through last Saturday, with ruling party lawmakers boycotting a vote at the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's inner circle has come under intense scrutiny for their role in last week's martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prison authorities on Wednesday said former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun tried to kill himself shortly before his formal arrest the previous day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former interior minister and the general in charge of the martial law operation are also barred from foreign travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two senior police officials were also arrested early on Wednesday. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Thursday advanced to the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old qualified after finishing fifth overall in the semi-finals, where she clocked a time of 51.83 seconds. American Gretchen Walsh topped the rankings with a 50.49-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final round is set to begin at 12.32am on Friday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200-metre freestyle title on Sunday, in what will be one of her last races before taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

    Firefly Sparkle galaxy sparks delight among stargazers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope has spotted a young galaxy dating to the early universe – called Firefly Sparkle because its gleaming star clusters resemble the bioluminescent bugs – in a discovery that is giving astronomers a peek at what our Milky Way may have looked like in its infancy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the galaxy, still in the process of assembling, dates to when the universe was roughly 5 percent of its current age, about 600 million years after the Big Bang event that initiated the cosmos. It has a mass equal to about 10 million stars the size of our sun, and has two other relatively small galaxies as neighbours, dubbed Firefly-Best Friend and Firefly-New Best Friend.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is comprised of 10 densely packed star clusters embedded in a diffuse arc of stars, eight in its central region and two along its extended arm. Its main visible portion spans about 1,000 light-years across. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
  <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy is estimated to have formed 100-400 million years before its evolutionary stage that was observed by Webb, the most capable space telescope ever deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Milky Way began forming very early in the universe's history, likely around the same time as Firefly Sparkle," said astronomer Lamiya Mowla of Wellesley College in Massachusetts and the Centre for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics in Bangladesh, co-lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pachuca of Mexico bested Brazilian side Botafogo 3-0 on Wednesday in the Intercontinental Cup to reach the next stage of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half strikes from Pachuca's Oussama Idrissi, Nelson Deossa and Salomón Rondón gave the North American continental champions victory over their South American counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really emotional," said Pachuca coach Guillermo Almada. "It was a party in the stadium with all the supporters from Pachuca and Botafogo that came here – it was a football party."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very happy," he added. "We're already thinking about the next game, which could be even more difficult than this one."
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the all-American clash progress to the next round of the new Intercontinental Cup format, where they will meet CAF Champions League winners Al Ahly of Egypt on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid, the current Uefa Champions League holders, lie in wait in the final four days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pachuca qualified for the tournament as victors of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup – following their 3-0 win in the final against MLS side Columbus Crew in early June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat put a dampener on a brilliant fortnight for Botafogo in which they won the Copa Libertadores and wrapped up the Brazilian Serie A.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't look for an excuse," said Botafogo coach Artur Jorge. "Pachuca were better than us, more efficient and more capable in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old Portuguese guided the Rio club to a first-ever Copa Libertadores and a first domestic league title since 1995 this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't the result we wanted, but we had an extraordinary year, made history," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal midfielder Bukayo Saka celebrates scoring. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783113_1_20241212073858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka's double fired Arsenal a step closer to the Champions League last 16 as the England forward inspired a 3-0 win against Monaco on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Saka netted late in each half and Kai Havertz struck in the closing minutes at the Emirates Stadium to lift Mikel Arteta's side into third place in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have won four of their six European games this term and, with two matches remaining, they control their destiny in the race for the top-eight finish that guarantees automatic progress to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clubs that finish ninth to 24th in the 36-team first phase face a play-off to determine if they will advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  With games against Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come in January, the north Londoners will be confident of avoiding that unwanted obstacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a damaging 1-1 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Arsenal's fifth win in their last six games in all competitions was a welcome tonic.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Arsenal's defensive injury crisis showing no signs of abating, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ben White, Riccardo Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Takehiro Tomiyasu were all absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey started out of position at right-back despite missing training on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly, 18, came in at left-back for just his second Arsenal start, with his other coming in the League Cup against third-tier Bolton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest player to start a Champions League match for Arsenal since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, Lewis-Skelly rose to the occasion with a composed display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Gabriel Jesus has gone 32 games without a goal for Arsenal and the Brazilian's lack of confidence was clear in the hosts' first dangerous attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Picked out by Gabriel Martinelli's pass, Jesus should have hit the target but could only muster a tame shot straight at Monaco keeper Radoslaw Majecki.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus failed to time his run well enough to reach Mikel Merino's teasing cross moments later. (AFP)

    Man City crisis deepens with defeat at Juventus

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were plunged further into crisis on Wednesday after falling to a 2-0 defeat at Juventus which threatens their chances of reaching the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie were enough for Juve to inflict a seventh defeat in 10 matches on Pep Guardiola's struggling City.
  <br>
  <br>
  English champions City languish in 22nd place in Europe's top club competition, having collected just eight points from their six matches in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  That leaves City just one point above the bottom 12 places and elimination, with matches against Paris Saint-Germain and Club Brugge remaining, a position that would have been unthinkable at the start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City have unravelled in less than six weeks and are way off the pace both in the Premier League and Champions League thanks to just one win, over Nottingham Forest, since the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have the Manchester derby at the weekend, hardly the sort of fixture they need in the midst of this dismal run from.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get points, we'll go to Paris to try and do that and the same goes for the final match at home," said Guardiola to Amazon Prime in Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can get out of this period by playing like we did today. We lost very few balls and I think we played very well... they deserve more because they give everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vlahovic's header, his 10th goal of the season, and substitute McKennie's fine volley with 15 minutes remaining also snapped a frustrating four-match run of draws for Juventus and brightened the mood among fans who have been disappointed with Thiago Motta's opening few months as coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve had drawn 11 of their 20 matches in all competitions coming into Wednesday's match, but a rugged display moved them up to 11 points and ended with fans roaring with joy and colouring the stands of the Allianz Stadium with flag waving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motta's team are level with fellow Serie A outfit Atalanta and two points from the top eight positions which give direct access to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was little suggestion of Juve grabbing such a big result after a very drab opening period in frigid Turin, where two off-form teams ineffectually bumped up against one another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The best chance of the half came five minutes before the break when Michele Di Gregorio did well to charge down Erling Haaland as the Norway striker tried to flick home Kevin De Bruyne's neat through ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve produced even less in front in increasingly frustrated supporters, who only had a Kenan Yildiz pot shot to shout about in a largely dismal opening period for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that all changed in the 53rd minute thanks to Vlahovic just about forcing his close-range header across the line after City goalkeeper Ederson had kept out Federico Gatti's flying volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stunned into action, City pushed for a leveller as Juve retreated into their own box, a move reminiscent of dozens of similarly dogged Italian defensive displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Di Gregorio did brilliantly to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's powerful long-range effort in the 68th minute, seconds before McKennie came on for Khephren Thuram.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American turned out to be an inspired choice as he was on hand, completely unmarked, to lash in countryman Timothy Weah's deftly clipped cross and kill off City's hopes of saving a point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a mixed session on Wednesday, with a rally in Google's parent company Alphabet spurring the tech-rich Nasdaq to end the day above 20,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slipped 0.2 percent to close at 44,148, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 6,084.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq was the day's big winner, jumping 1.8 percent to close at a new record of 20,034, after Alphabet reported it had made a breakthrough in quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent the firm's share price soaring, with its class A shares closing up 5.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also digesting the news that consumer inflation ticked higher last month, largely in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investors are reacting positively to the latest inflation data for two reasons," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Number one, it gives the Fed more room to continue with easy money, cutting rates," he said. "And then number two, it allows more room for the economy to grow without the threat of inflation picking up." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The father and stepmother of Sara Sharif, a 10-year-old girl who was found dead in her home in Britain, were on Wednesday convicted of her murder after a trial which heard harrowing details of her treatment before her killing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sharif was found dead in August 2023 at her home in Woking, a town southwest of London, after what prosecutors say was a campaign of "serious and repeated violence".
  <br>
  <br>
  The family fled to Pakistan immediately after Sara Sharif was killed, before they were arrested in September 2023 at London's Gatwick airport after flying from Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Sara had suffered a litany of injuries, including burns, broken bones and bite marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and his wife Beinash Batool, 30, stood trial at London's Old Bailey court charged with her murder, which they denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jury convicted Sharif and Batool of Sara's murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sara's uncle Faisal Malik, 29, was found not guilty of murder but guilty of causing or allowing Sara's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif and Batool will be sentenced on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emlyn Jones told jurors at the start of the trial that Urfan Sharif had called police and said: "It wasn't my intention to kill her, but I beat her up too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif gave evidence and initially denied responsibility for Sara's death. He accepted slapping Sara to discipline her, but denied beating her in a regular or sustained way.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sharif, under questioning from Batool's lawyer Caroline Carberry, later said he took "full responsibility" for his daughter's death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for Batool, who did not give evidence, said Sharif was violent and controlling and that she was scared of him. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least one person was killed after a powerful blast rocked a residential high-rise building in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, mainland media reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Fire Brigade said it sent 16 fire trucks and 80 rescue personnel to the scene after receiving a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing News said a preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out on the 28th floor due to a gas explosion, with the cause of the blast still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  One person reportedly fell off the building following the blast, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said workers at the nearby 66-storey China Resources Tower said they felt tremors after the explosion. Some companies in the building evacuated their staff to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations and rescue efforts are underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua/Reuters)

<img alt="South Korean police said they sent officers to search Yoon’s office, but investigators failed to enter the premises as of Wednesday evening.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police said Wednesday that security guards were blocking a raid on President Yoon Suk-yeol's offices to investigate his brief imposition of martial law, with the opposition party accusing the presidential staff of illegally protecting an insurrectionist.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is already banned from foreign travel as part of an "insurrection" probe into his inner circle over the dramatic events of December 3-4 that stunned South Korea's allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several hours into a standoff at the presidential offices, police Wednesday evening said "The special investigation team is currently continuing to discuss the seizure and search of the presidential office (with the presidential staff and security)."
  <br>
  <br>
  The main opposition Democratic Party warned it would file legal complaints for insurrection against the presidential staff and security if they continued to obstruct law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the presidential office (staff) and the security are protecting right now is not the head of state, but an insurrectionist," said DP lawmaker and spokesperson Jo Seung-lae. (AFP)
