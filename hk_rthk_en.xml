<img alt="The Security Bureau said there's been a significant increase in theft cases on board Hong Kong-bound flights this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782061_1_20241204143235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said the number of thefts on board Hong Kong-bound aircraft for the first 10 months of the year reached a seven-year high, involving property worth more than HK$4.3 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security minister Chris Tang on Wednesday said there were 169 such cases recorded through October, with most of them involving short-haul flights from Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure compares to 147 cases for the whole of 2019, and 103 the year before that.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to the legislature, the minister described the rise in the number of cases as significant, saying items stolen included cash, credit cards, jewellery and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The increase] might be due to the fact that the police have stepped up publicity to encourage more people to report crimes, or the overall economic situation," he wrote in response to DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people have been arrested - one of them on remand pending trial, with another released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charges for two others were dropped because of a lack of evidence, or because witnesses refused to come to Hong Kong to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the government had no plans to install surveillance cameras or arrange security personal in airplane cabins for now, citing privacy reasons, manpower and the principle of proportionality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, there are no international policies regulating the installation of CCTV or arrangements of security staff on duty inside cabins, nor are these common practices generally adopted by airlines," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tang said officials would work with airlines to engage in more educational and publicity campaigns.

 South Korea's opposition parties on Wednesday said they had tabled a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol.
 <br>
  <br>
  A member of the opposition told reporters the vote to impeach President Yoon could happen as early as Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is facing mounting legislative and public pressure to leave office or be forced out, hours after he ended a short-lived martial law that prompted troops to encircle parliament overnight before lawmakers voted to lift it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon’s senior advisers and secretaries offered to resign collectively and his Cabinet members, including Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, were also facing calls to step down, as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly-thought-out stunt. (Agencies)

    Proposed Tai Lam Tunnel tolls are reasonable: lawmaker

<img alt="Frankie Yick backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782050_1_20241204132256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s plan to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel has been welcomed by transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick who describes the proposed new tolls as “acceptable”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yick told RTHK on Wednesday that he understands people want to see lower tolls, but they have to realise the priority is to ease traffic congestion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Well, of course, I think everybody wants the government to lower down the toll to make it even more affordable. But I think we have to look at the numbers. So, if we believe the numbers are correct, I think the most important thing is after the introduction of the new toll, we have to make sure the Tai Lam Tunnel will not be congested. Otherwise, it will defeat the whole purpose,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yick also backed the decision not to allow toll-free journeys during non-peak hours, saying the charges are affordable and it is reasonable to make people pay for the maintenance costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think I would agree that we should maintain some charges, but of course the most important thing is whether it's affordable by the driving public. If you look at the non-peak hours fee right now at HK$18 [for private cars], I think it's quite reasonable in a sense.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “And of course the government, after taking over the management of the tunnel, they do have the maintenance costs and future investment costs, upgrade of services, that sort of stuff. I think they still need money to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, the chairman of Legco's panel on transport, expressed hope that the government would consider further reducing the tolls for taxis and commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government has provided us data and told us it hopes to avoid congestion in the tunnel. This is also in the public's interest. We hope that if the new toll system is implemented, there will be a review after about a year to assess the actual transport situation and see if these tolls are necessary,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, said he thinks the charges during peak hours will still be high, urging authorities to shorten the peak hours period and further reduce fees during other times of day.

    Govt reviewing scheme to help traffic accident victims

<img alt="Chris Sun said officials are looking into making changes to a scheme offering help to traffic accident victims." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782041_1_20241204124607.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Wednesday said officials were looking at lowering the maximum amount of sick leave allowed under a subsidy scheme for people involved in traffic accidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the police said they had arrested 275 people on suspicion of "staging" accidents to obtain the allowance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister told lawmakers the scheme currently allows for 180 days of leave, and officials are inclined to cut that down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently, the maximum sick leave allowed is roughly half a year. We think this should be subject to review. We'll see if we should give so much, and whether we should lower the number.....and by how much? We will have a look," Sun said at a Legislative Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another thing is that there are quite a number of subsidy items on offer. One is for those injured, another is for those who cannot go to work. We think there are too many forms of subsidies. The aim is mainly to weather the storm for the recipient. So we'll think of ways to consolidate these, to simplify things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said officials also have to implement the scheme under the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of revenues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the money for the subsidies comes from transport-related fees such as licensing and vehicle registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister hoped the review could be completed before the end of the year, for tabling the proposed changes to the legislature for discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also said following the arrests, social welfare officials have reviewed their workflow, and made extra efforts to check the documents submitted by subsidy applicants, especially those who were making repeated claims.

    CUHK invents non-invasive way to find bowel disease

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University researchers on Wednesday said they have invented non-invasive technology to identify bowel disease, reducing the need for endoscopies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The university made use of faecal samples from about 6,000 people from different regions, and found about 20 types of bacteria associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis Chan, professor of medicine and therapeutics, said droplet digital PCR technology can be used to test stool samples and determine whether a patient has IBD or a different gut disorder.
  <br>
  <br>
  “IBD, at least early stage, their symptoms are no different from our common functional gut problems like irritable bowel syndrome,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That's the reason why when many patients present with these recurrent symptoms related to the gut, they go to see the doctor, and then they have no choice but to undergo endoscopy, just to make sure that they are not suffering from IBD.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said traditionally, it takes up to 12 months for a patient with IBD to be diagnosed, and delayed treatment can lead to serious complications like bleeding and bowel cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said results from the stool test are available in a week, allowing for earlier diagnosis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers said the technology can also assess the risk of bowel cancer among IBD patients, adding that the test is expected to be ready for clinical use in Hong Kong in 2027.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said it is important to uphold the Constitution when making legislative and policy changes, to ensure reform is in the right direction.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a seminar on Constitution Day, Lee said the Constitution is the country's supreme law and provides the legal framework for policy formulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In further deepening reform comprehensively, we must regard the Constitution as our country's fundamental law by upholding and implementing the Constitution's requirements, principles, and spirit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only then can we ensure our reform stays on the right track and proceeds in the right way at a steady pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that constitutional education and implementation must go hand in hand to ensure that people respect and comply with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is because a solid grasp of the Constitution's substance and spirit among the entire populace is crucial to a healthy atmosphere of respect for the law and compliance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong can play its role by maximising its unique strengths under the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same seminar that the SAR should continue to pursue high-quality development and deepen reform under the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also embark on innovations. We have accumulated new experience, and we have also designated a Constitution Day and other measures. So all these have been taken under our new innovative spirit, and this is a result of the rule of law and reform," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tourists heading to South Korea on Wednesday said they were not fazed about the short-lived martial law in the country as the government called on residents to remain cautious.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol ended martial law hours after the declaration last night.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, flights for South Korea were operating as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Wong was heading to South Korea alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She admitted she was a bit worried when martial law was declared, but noted that it was short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  She believed the situation in the country should be fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to check the news before I head out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will also try to avoid places with crowds, as my friends told me that if I see people gathering, I should not get close."
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman surnamed Cheung told RTHK that she's not too concerned about the situation, adding that whatever happens, happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hongkonger, surnamed Law, believed she will be safe as long as she stays away from protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said if anything happens, she will stay in the hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Koreans in the SAR said they were shocked about the declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Park, who's in the region with a friend for a taekwondo competition, said he and his pal were sceptical about the news when it broke.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We [thought] that it's not real situation. [We thought] it's fake. We talked to each other that it's fake news. But it's a real situation. So we are very surprised. About 40 years ago, you know that Korea is under the military government, but Korea is very developed economically and politically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And democracy, we Korean people made democracy. So we believe that this kind of situation cannot be real and cannot stay [for long]. So we are very happy to see that the situation is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Travel Industry Council said around 400 people from 26 tours groups are in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their trips have not been affected and there are no plans for them to return to Hong Kong earlier than scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council has not received any requests for assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the SAR government urged Hong Kong residents who are in the country or plan to go to South Korea to remain cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They should] monitor the situation, exercise caution, attend to personal safety, avoid large gatherings of people and pay attention to local announcements on the latest situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau said social order in South Korea is normal for now, and it would closely monitor the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, no one has asked for assistance from the Immigration Department.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it plans to charge time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel after it takes control of the infrastructure in the New Territories on May 31 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car and taxi drivers pay HK$58, while commercial vehicle drivers pay between HK$64 and HK$79 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau and Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the new tolling system, there will be three levels of charges for “peak”, “general” and “non-peak” hours, similar to the system used for the cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning rush hour will be from 7.15am to 9.45am, while the evening peak period will be from 5.15pm to 7pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  For private cars, the proposed toll during peak hours is HK$45, HK$30 for normal periods of the day, and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motorcyclists will pay HK$18 during peak hours, HK$12 during normal periods and HK$7.2 at non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taxis will be charged a fixed toll of HK$28 and commercial vehicles HK$43 throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fixed charging scheme will apply to all vehicles on Sundays and public holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also explained that it hasn't considered toll-free journeys in non-peak hours because it believes the best approach is to have users cover the infrastructure costs, emphasising this has nothing to do with the higher-than-expected government deficit this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the scheme will ease traffic on alternative routes such as Tuen Mun Road and the Tolo Highway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuen Mun Road is expected to see 300 fewer private cars during the busiest hour of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a mechanism in place to adjust the tolls, with any changes capped at no more than HK$3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it plans to table a bill on the plans to Legco for a first reading next Wednesday, and hopes to see it passed in the first quarter of next year.

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)

    Charity hopes OSC funding can help educate refugees

<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity group which helps the refugee community is seeking support to boost its efforts to educate the needy, particularly to make recipients more tech-savvy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grassroots Future is among 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC). It was founded four years ago during the pandemic to help refugees and asylum seekers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity now focuses on helping the recipients with their education, mental well-being and community building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its director, Tegan Smyth, said with many things getting more expensive, such as textbooks, one of her group's initiatives is to relieve the financial stress of parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's called TE(A)CH at the Grassroots and it's covering an IT program for refugee and asylum seeker children and their parents over a two-year basis. It's also covering textbook expenses, which is a really pressing need for the community," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smyth said education is a major barrier for refugee children in the SAR, because their parents are unable to work, making it hard for them to pay upfront for textbooks and other school expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that her charity has been helping around 30 children a year, and she hopes the number will keep rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.
  <br>

    HK must reform amid economic transformation: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said the time is ripe for various sectors in Hong Kong to speed up reform, and there is no exception for the government especially after the country adopted a resolution on further deepening reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a new season of the RTHK programme
  <i>
   Overview Policy
  </i>
  , Lee said he has been trying to push for reform since he took office in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At that time, I used milder words, such as 'change'. That's because everybody will interpret the reform differently," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said reform is never easy, as it often affects people with vested interests or forces people to leave their comfort zone, so it's necessary to convince the public why reform is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the elements of success Hong Kong rode on in the past may not work anymore... Mainland cities are improving very quickly, with new technologies and systems. They have a stronger social basis and are more receptive to reform."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said businesses must adapt amid the city's economic transformation and changes in consumption patterns for locals and visitors alike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [businesses] don't carry out reform, they'll be phased out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive said society has reached a consensus on the need for reform.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we only have to tell people the disadvantages of not carrying out reform and the advantages of reform. Society already knows about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government needs to embrace reform as well, and that he's told senior staff to be more proactive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to strike first. Before a problem surfaces, it's best that you foresee the problem and correct it... if there are ambiguous situations, just step in, instead of wasting time to debate who should take responsibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said principal officials have been ordered to face the public more by disseminating messages regularly on social media, so the public knows the government is tackling problems whenever they arise.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Wednesday said the Constitution provides the fundamental legal protection for the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, and people should start learning about the Constitution from a young age.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the flag-raising ceremony on Constitution Day, Lam said the event was established to promote constitutional spirit and the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the fundamental importance of the Constitution in implementing 'One Country, Two Systems' in Hong Kong, we must strengthen constitutional awareness. The prerequisite is to deepen public understanding and knowledge of the Constitution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activities on Constitution Day serve to promote and propagate the Constitution. It's also a good opportunity to promote rule of law awareness through public education."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR should make full use of the unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The justice chief also called it an "important mission" to teach youngsters about what the Constitution is and why it matters, adding that disciplinary services officers should stand at the forefront as guardians of the Constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 members of the disciplined services took part in the flag-raising ceremony led by the Security Bureau at the Hong Kong Customs College.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday said it would initiate impeachment proceedings against President Yoon Suk-yeol unless he immediately resigned, after his short-lived declaration of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon "does not resign immediately, the Democratic Party will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings in line with the will of the people," it said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A coalition of lawmakers from opposition parties said they planned to propose a bill to impeach Yoon on Wednesday which should be voted within 72 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The parliament should focus on immediately suspending the president’s business to pass an impeachment bill soonest,” Hwang Un-ha, one of the MPs in the coalition, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's chief of staff and senior secretaries offered to resign en masse, a presidential official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told the nation in a TV address that martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North anti-state forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes ensued as helmeted troops climbed into the parliament building through smashed windows and military helicopters hovered overhead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command.
  <br>
  <br>
  But within hours of the declaration, South Korea's parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion requiring martial law be lifted, including all 18 members present from Yoon's party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then rescinded the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.
  <br>
  <br>
  More protests are expected on Wednesday with South Korea's largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, planning to hold a rally in Seoul and vowing to strike until Yoon resigns. (Agencies)

 The Seoul stock exchange fell 2 percent at the opening on Wednesday before limiting its losses in early trading, after President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared then lifted martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kospi composite index tumbled to 2,450 points as trading opened while shares in the country's biggest company Samsung Electronics slid 3 percent before paring losses about half an hour later to 1.12 percent down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean won lost 2.5 percent against the greenback overnight to 1,444.09 against the dollar, its weakest level in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It later regained ground at the start of Asian trading, ahead of an extraordinary meeting called by the South Korean central bank to "discuss the situation related to the declaration of martial law and market stabilisation measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 0030 GMT, it was trading at 1,414.49 won against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's stocks started the day cautiously, with blue-chip Nikkei down 0.11 percent to 39,205 points at the open. (AFP)

 Bayern Munich were dumped out of the German Cup by holders Bayer Leverkusen as Nathan Tella's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Bundesliga champions on Tuesday, after Manuel Neuer saw the first red card of his 866-game career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old rushed out of the box in typical fashion 18 minutes in to the German Cup last-16 clash, taking out an advancing Jeremie Frimpong and seeing a straight red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's sending-off brought Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz on for his Bayern debut, 18 months after joining the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern, who were already without the injured Harry Kane, dug deep despite the one-man disadvantage and dominated the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors eventually broke through in the 69th minute, though, with Tella heading in an Alex Grimaldo cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tella had only been on the field for eight minutes having come on for injured striker Patrik Schick, who himself was subbed on at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home winger Michael Olise lashed inches wide in the fourth minute of stoppage time but Leverkusen held on to inflict a first domestic defeat on Vincent Kompany since he became Bayern coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were too hectic and tried to go forward too quickly," Leverkusen captain Jonathan Tah said. "At half-time, we said we need to be patient – and we did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The red card decided the game," Neuer told reporters after the match. "It hurt us, and I'm sorry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who won an unbeaten league and cup double last season, are through to the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern have won the German Cup a record 20 times – 14 more than the next best – but have not made it past the quarter-finals since 2020, when they defeated Leverkusen 4-2 in the final. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said he had been "astonished" by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester's eight but failed to make it count.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze's pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles' first away win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. (AFP)

<img alt="A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781978_1_20241204054412.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh records with narrow gains on Tuesday as markets reacted to mixed labour market data that kept alive the possibility of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices have been notching regular records following the US presidential election, spawning talk that markets are now overvalued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not a whole lot of natural drivers of new money coming into the market at this point," said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners, adding that markets appear "biased to the upside" in light of a benign 2025 financial outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.2 percent at 44,705.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 6,049, a third straight record, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 19,480, scoring its second straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October, but also a decline in new job postings during the month, a less upbeat sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data overall provides "good grounds" for the Fed to lower interest rates again this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets lifted the odds of another rate cut by the US central bank on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, AT&T jumped 4.6 percent as it announced US$40 billion in shareholder give-backs at an investor day where it projected revenue and operating earnings growth over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  United States Steel sank 8.0 percent after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated a pledge to block a takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla dropped 1.6 percent after a US judge upheld her decision to reject Elon Musk's massive US$55.8 billion compensation package, concluding the electric car company's shareholder vote to reinstate the plan did not override her initial ruling. (AFP)

<img alt="Yamal returned to the Barca line-up after recovering from an ankle injury. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781977_1_20241204054235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raphinha and Lamine Yamal inspired Barcelona to a first win in four La Liga outings as they beat Mallorca 5-1 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive victory brings the Catalans to 37 points at the top of the league table, four ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, but with two extra matches played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish and European champions will have the chance to cut that lead back to one point on Wednesday when they travel to Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca stay sixth in La Liga, still two points behind Athletic Bilbao in the final Champions League spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres gave Barcelona the lead, before Vedat Muriqi equalised to ensure the sides were level at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha and Yamal lit up the second half as the away side ran riot with the Brazilian scoring a double, followed by strikes from Frenkie de Jong and Pau Victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona were boosted by the return of teenage starlet Yamal, who started the match after recovering from an ankle problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side dropped points in the two league outings Yamal missed, and were also defeated last time out at home to lowly Las Palmas when he was only fit enough to start on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts gifted Barca the lead in the 12th minute when panicked defending resulted in Torres being presented with a golden opportunity when there seemed to be no danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a trio of Majorcan defenders shepherded the ball back to their goalkeeper, full-back Johan Mojica suddenly decided to try to lash it away, only to smash the ball straight into Antonio Raillo and it fell perfectly to the feet of the Barcelona forward, who duly stroked home the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' high defensive line caught Mallorca out on several occasions as they tried to spring their attackers with passes over the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca were, however, starting to build pressure on Barcelona, though the visitors remained dangerous on the counter with their fleet-footed attacking quartet of Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Torres.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second goal in the match did not seem far away, for either side, and it came for the hosts in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inigo Martinez was deeper than the rest of the Barcelona line and Pablo Maffeo timed his run onto Sergi Darder's pass to perfection, before rolling the ball across to Muriqi to tap into an open net. (AFP)

    South Korea president says will lift martial law

<img alt="South Korea's National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik passes a resolution demanding the immediate lifting of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781974_1_20241204052609.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift martial law, just hours after imposing it in a bid to quell what he called "anti-state forces."
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the unexpected declaration, which caught even South Korea's closest allies around the world off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier the National Assembly was sealed and troops entered the building for a short time, while hundreds of protesters gathered outside and faced off with security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations," Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will accept the National Assembly's request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency reported that Yoon's cabinet approved the motion to lift the order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon's martial law order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators waving banners and South Korean flags and chanting "Arrest Yoon Sul Yeol" outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lim Myeong-pan, 55, said that Yoon's decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yoon's act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself," said Lim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has paved his own path to impeachment with this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 190 lawmakers had managed to get into the assembly in the early hours of Wednesday, where they unanimously voted in favour of a motion to block the martial law declaration and call for its lifting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law – South Korea's first in more than 40 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address late on Tuesday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon did not give details of the North's threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order," Yoon said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon described the imposition of martial law as "inevitable to guarantee the continuity of a liberal South Korea," adding that it would not impact the country's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the current situation as South Korea "on the verge of collapse, with the National Assembly acting as a monster intent on bringing down liberal democracy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean won dropped to a more than two-year low against the US dollar on Tuesday, while exchange traded funds linked to South Korean stocks fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unannounced late-night address live on YTN television.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean unit fell to as low as 1,430.82 won per dollar, the lowest since October 2022. It was last down 1.9 percent at 1,430.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's uncertainty driven.. one of those 'shoot first, ask questions later' (moves)," said Christopher Wong, FX and rates strategist at OCBC in Singapore. "Given the lack of information, the uncertainty may still keep Korean won under pressure in the interim."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken the parliamentary process hostage to throw the country into a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks listed overseas swooned. The MSCI South Korea ETF fell 4.5 percent, while the Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF slid 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With losses of more than 9 percent so far this year, the won is one of Asia's worst performers and has been persistently under pressure as the Bank of Korea cut rates aggressively to support the economy and as investors fled a market they see as exposed heavily to exports and to US trade tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Korean won is already under pressure from the looming threat of tariffs and their detrimental impact on export-driven economies," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This latest development is likely to exacerbate the currency’s weakness, encouraging speculators to use the won as a high-beta proxy for expressing tariff-related risks." (Reuters)

 A man died after reportedly being stung by bees while hiking in Tai Po on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police received a call from a woman at 4:15pm, saying she and her three friends had been attacked by bees on Lai Pek Shan.
  <br>
  <br>

  He was found unconscious about three and a half hours later by the Government Flying Service team and rushed to Eastern Hospital where he was certified dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman who called the police also suffered bee stings and was treated at Nethersole Hospital.

 South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol on Tuesday declared emergency martial law, saying the measure was necessary to protect the country from "communist forces".
 <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements... I hereby declare emergency martial law," Yoon said in a live televised address to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declared the step as critical for defending the country's constitutional order. It wasn't immediately clear how the steps would affect the country's governance and democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon since taking office in 2022 had struggled to push his agendas against an opposition-controlled parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. He has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement. (Agencies)

 King Charles and Keir Starmer welcomed Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for a state visit to Britain on Tuesday that the prime minister hopes will help build on the Gulf state's investment in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The emir and wife Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani arrived by car at Horse Guards Parade in London with Prince William and his wife Kate, who was marking her return to formal state visit duties after undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles, who is continuing his own treatment for cancer, and the emir inspected the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards while a military band played.
  <br>
  <br>
  The morning of pageantry was to be followed by a trip to Westminster where the emir will address both chambers of the Houses of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain is seeking deeper ties with the wealthy Gulf state, and Starmer hopes to use the visit to secure "tangible benefits" for the country on security and the economy, his spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer was elected in July on a promise to lift economic growth and is looking to potential wealthy investors such as Qatar to help fund his plans for new infrastructure and energy developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qatar is already a big investor in Britain through the Qatar Investment Authority which owns the Canary Wharf business and entertainment district in east London, the Shard landmark skyscraper in central London, and stakes in bluechip names such as Barclays and Heathrow Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can expect them to discuss how we can build further on our two countries' thriving trade and investment partnership," the prime minister's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two royal families departed by horse-drawn carriage for Buckingham Palace where they were due to have lunch with Queen Camilla, who was absent from the outdoor event as she continues to recover from a chest infection. (Reuters)

    Ideas for Ocean Park to cut costs and raise revenues

<img alt="Lawmakers looked at ways Ocean Park could cut costs and raise revenues during a Legco panel meeting on Tuesday. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781940_1_20241203204442.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Tuesday discussed ways to help Ocean Park improve its finances after it posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on economic development, the theme park disclosed that its water park, or Water World, lost over HK$200 million last financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong explained Water World had only been running for two years and was still in its growth phase, promising lawmakers the theme park would work hard to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers voiced concerns Ocean Park might struggle to stay financially sustainable, urging it to use the opportunities created by its six pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu noted that following the resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, Ocean Park could consider giving them more discounts to boost visitor numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Benson Luk from the Business and Professionals Alliance, suggested Ocean Park lease out its outdoor areas to host major events to increase revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung noted Ocean Park has been thinking of different ways to find more sources of income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Ocean Park will make use of the resources available to try to increase revenue, for example concerts can be held in the park. This will also help solve the problem of not having enough venues in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien suggested the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) take over the water park's operations to reduce losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Ocean Park’s] current loss last year is strictly due to one project, which is the water park. The loss of the water park, which is in excess of HK$200 million, is about the same as the government subsidy,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  “So basically, the government is not subsidising the other activities of Ocean Park, and that is unfair to Ocean Park and is tying up the hands of the entire team. So my suggestion is to spin off the water park, and give it to LCSD,” he said.

    EU pushes for outdoor vaping and smoking ban

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU countries agreed on Tuesday on a push for stricter anti-smoking rules, backing bans on smoking and vaping in many outdoor areas including playgrounds and cafe patios.
 <br>
  <br>
  A recommendation inviting member states to crack down on second-hand smoke and vapour was adopted by health ministers from the bloc's 27 nations meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's agreement is a crucial step towards our goal of a tobacco-free generation in Europe, and is critical in protecting our children and young people from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke," said the EU's health commissioner, Oliver Varhelyi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recommendation is non-binding, as health is a competence of individual member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it gives an indication of the policies governments could pursue in the future as they seek to reduce smoke-related deaths and ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It passed with all countries voting in favour apart from Germany and Greece, which abstained, underscoring some political divisions on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the European Parliament voted against a similar text.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document approved on Tuesday calls on EU countries to extend restrictions in place for cigarettes to cover "emerging products", such as heated tobacco devices and electronic cigarettes that are increasingly popular with young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governments should "provide effective protection" from aerosols emitted by these in indoor environments such as offices and public buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following an initial proposal put forward by the European Commission in September, the text says such protection should also be granted in some outdoor areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  This in practice entails that all smoking should be banned in locations including swimming pools, beaches, zoos, rooftop bars and restaurant terraces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The push comes as the EU is aiming to reduce its smoking population from around 25 percent now to less than five percent of the total by 2040, as part of its "Beating Cancer Plan".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobacco use is estimated to kill more than eight million people globally each year, including about 1.3 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emissions from electronic cigarettes also typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful including to second-hand smokers, according to the WHO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But treating smoking and vaping the same way is contentious.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint declaration ahead of the vote, Italy and Romania said calls for a ban on outdoor vaping lacked scientific basis and should have not been included in the recommendation. The two countries nevertheless backed the text.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany abstained saying that the issue fell within the competences of its regions -- not the central government -- and some opposed a ban on smoking in outdoor terraces and patios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece similarly voiced scepticism about the effect of such rules, saying more scientific data was needed on the effects of e-cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament last week voted against a resolution on the same subject, after lawmakers on the right passed amendments to differentiate between traditional tobacco products and electronic devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  This drew the ire of the left, which had supported the original text but rejected its watered down version.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the outdoor smoking ban as a violation of individual freedom," Pietro Fiocchi, a lawmaker with the hard-right ECR group, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parliamentary resolution, which would have had only symbolic value, was turned down with 378 votes against and only 152 in favour. (AFP)

    China imposes export curbs on chipmaking against US

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement that cited national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to "stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses", the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States," Beijing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States "abuses export control measures" and has "hindered normal economic and trade exchanges".
  <br>
  <br>
  And on Tuesday, China said Washington had "politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues" as it unveiled its own export curbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves also restrict the exports of "dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes", Beijing said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new study shows that most schoolchildren in Hong Kong are not doing the 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day recommended by the World Health Organisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the University of Hong Kong’s department of paediatrics said research he carried out for the InspiringHK Sports Foundation found less than eight percent of more than 1,000 primary and secondary students studied met the exercise standard over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip blamed this on poor habits developed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have observed a very alarming situation that during non-school days and public holidays, children actually did not go out with their friends, their family members to play sports or do any activities under the sunshine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This turns out to be a very bad habit. If that habit continues, our next generation will be at a much worse physical activity level, as well as having a poor shape in both physical and mental health.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said it hopes that by 2030, 16 percent of Hong Kong schoolchildren will reach the 60 minutes per day recommendation, adding that it will launch a scheme next year aimed at promoting physical activity among schoolchildren.

<img alt="Security chief Chris Tang says authorities have received 23 requests for assistance so far this year of Hongkongers allegedly being detained in Southeast Asia to work illegally." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781904_1_20241203162256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has warned against a resurgence of cases involving Hong Kong residents allegedly being held captive in Southeast Asia to work illegally.
 <br>
  <br>
  A number of Hongkongers fell for employment scams and were detained in various Southeast Asian countries in 2022, prompting the government to set up a task force to coordinate follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far this year, authorities received 23 requests for assistance. Eleven of them returned to the SAR, while the others were discovered safe even though their movements were reportedly restricted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the second quarter of 2024, there have been signs of a resurgence of cases of Hong Kong residents being suspected to have been lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work," Tang told a Legislative Council panel on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said immigration officials have been following up on the cases through foreign ministry representatives in Hong Kong as well as diplomatic and consular missions elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the government had learned about what happened from those who had returned to Hong Kong, Tang said none of the Hongkongers suspected to be detained against their will were taken away while on holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For each case, once the citizen has returned to Hong Kong, we would interview them, ask them why they were lured overseas and how they were released," Tang told lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But let me say this, most of the individuals went voluntarily and then they were detained there illegally. There was never a case that an individual was abducted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The security chief said authorities would continue to monitor online communications and strengthen cooperation with their international counterparts, while stepping up calls for people to be more alert to job scams.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from flooding in southern Thailand has risen to 25, officials said on Tuesday, with days more heavy rain forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twelve provinces in southern Thailand have been hit by flooding since late November, affecting more than 410,000 people, the country's disaster agency said on its Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency's announcement raises a previous death toll of nine reported on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 22,000 people have been displaced from their homes due to flooding in Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla and Yala provinces, the Thai government's public relations department said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suwas Bin-Uma, a chicken farm owner in Songkhla, told state broadcaster Thai PBS that the floods had wiped out his entire flock of more than 10,000 chickens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost at least three million baht (US$87,000)," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai weather agency on Tuesday warned of continued heavy rain until December 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday the Thai cabinet approved a 9,000 baht payment per family to support those affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring Malaysia, south of the Thai border, disaster officials said on Tuesday that more than 94,000 people were yet to return to their homes after being evacuated to shelters due to the floods, with at least five people reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said five days of heavier-than-expected rain that battered the country's east coast last week was equal to the rainfall over the past six months, wreaking havoc in the northeastern state of Kelantan and neighbouring Terengganu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heavy downpours damaged roads and houses in Kelantan and other parts of Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers used boats to distribute food to victims trapped in their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said it would cost the government an estimated 1 billion ringgit (US$224 million) to repair infrastructure damaged by the floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rain eased over the weekend, but the Meteorological Department forecast heavy rains later on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said the government is bracing for another monsoon surge that is expected to hit on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China lifted trade restrictions on two Australian meat processing facilities, allowing the full resumption of red meat exports to the country, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has now removed restrictions from all 10 Australian abattoirs it banned between 2020 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bans were imposed around the time that China blocked imports of commodities including coal, barley and wine from Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all those restrictions have been removed since a new government won power in Canberra in 2022, with trade in lobster, the final banned product, set to restart by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is great news for Australian exporters, producers and farmers," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we were elected we've worked tirelessly to resume trade and that's exactly what we are seeing. It's a win for trade and a win for Australian jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the second largest market for Australian beef and veal after the United States, receiving around 200,000 metric tonnes a year worth around US$1.5 billion in recent years, Australian trade data showed. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile US$12 billion fraud case, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High People's Court in Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, local media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as "Blazing Furnace".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable," the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including "having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled", but prosecutors said that was insufficient.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's retrial procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank, which was at the centre of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. (Reuters)

    'HKU community pharmacy for education, research use'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday said its community pharmacy merged pharmaceutical services with education and research, which is different from other medical dispensaries in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located at the medical school's campus in Pok Fu Lam, the community pharmacy opened its doors in November, serving mainly Queen Mary Hospital patients as well as HKU staff and students.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical facility, which is the city's first teaching community pharmacy on a university campus, offers a number of prescription-only medications and drugs for minor ailments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jovan Chow, a third year pharmacy student at HKU, said he was able to learn by observing how pharmacists interact with patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My biggest takeaway from [working at] the community pharmacy is actually the soft skills I acquired during my time here... I have more opportunities to have a glance of how community pharmacies operate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ian Wong, professor of pharmacology and pharmacy at the university's medical faculty, said the facility goes beyond serving those seeking help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main duties and core functions of a university are teaching, research, and knowledge transfer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pharmacy's mission is also to [give] the best education to our students, and secondly, is to make use of this pharmacy to conduct research, so that we can help our patients and citizens to optimise the use of medicine. And finally, providing services is actually a knowledge transfer, so that we make use of our knowledge to treat our patients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he believes the Northern Metropolis project will bring a good return on investment and the public will be able to share the fruits of the development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, more than 80 enterprises and developers signed an expression of interest for the development, along with separate agreements for projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very confident that the Northern Metropolis development plan will invite and attract a lot of interest," Lee told reporters before heading into the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be also developing the San Tin Technopole. There will also be a university city and different pockets of land, and all these will add together to create extra value for Hong Kong. All these projects will bring a good return on investment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether there will be penalties for enterprises that sign agreements but don't invest, Lee said he believes these investments will pay off well in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we have to look very far ahead in the future. Some investment periods may be as long as five to 15 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that he hopes to find innovative ways to ensure regular citizens also benefit from these investments.

    Cut education spending to reduce deficit: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local economist on Tuesday suggested the government reduce spending on education to save money.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan earlier revised the estimated government deficit for the current financial year, doubling it to around HK$100 billion due to poor performance in the asset markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Terence Chong, executive director of Chinese University's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance, said the government could link education spending to the student population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the number of students drops, there's no reason for the government to increase education expenditure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Should we think about reforming education spending and pegging it against the student population? If student numbers fall, shouldn't we reduce spending?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it would be difficult for the government to save money by cutting civil servant pay or reducing the civil service establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong said such a move would only lead to government workers opting to work in the private sector instead, with public services affected as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Wendy Hong said the government could consider recovering education costs from non-local university students.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong, who's a member of Legco's financial affairs panel, said such students are only charged HK$150,000 to HK$180,000, even though the annual cost of their education is HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a gradual process. Of course, with the increased cost, their interest to come and study in Hong Kong might be reduced. We can offer scholarships at the same time to attract those in the top-tier," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A court ruling overturning the approval of an environmental study on building flats on Fanling golf course won't significantly affect Hong Kong's public housing supply over the next decade, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a decision handed down on Monday, the High Court called on the authorities to consult the public again on plans to build public flats on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said while overall housing goals over the next 10 years won't change, the ruling will affect how many homes they can build at the golf course and how long it will take.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following the judgment, in terms of the number of public housing units, the density and the delay in the housing production, we are seeing a significant impact. And that means the government will have to conduct a holistic assessment," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told reporters that officials have secured land to produce more than 308,000 public housing units in the next 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The change in relation to the public housing development on Fanling golf course should not pose a major change to the public housing production target," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will conduct analyses before deciding the way forward, including whether to launch an appeal.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the government will introduce different measures to spur economic growth amid a larger-than-expected budget deficit, describing the central government's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong more often as coming at just the right time.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the financial secretary changed the deficit forecast for the current financial year from HK$48.1 billion to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue due to poor asset market performances and a drop in profits tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Lee stressed that officials will cut spending and formulate measures to increase revenue -- but they'll be cautious with the measures so as to reduce the impact on the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the visa rule change for Shenzhen residents is among many measures exemplifying the country's strong backing for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are also new growth points, for example, the third runway system, which has been commissioned. Next year, Kai Tak Sports Park will also be commissioned. A lot of international major events will take place in Hong Kong," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will stimulate our economy and increase government revenue. The government, meanwhile, also continues to consolidate our status as an international financial trade and shipping centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will hold a Q&A session in the legislature next Thursday, and one of the topics will be economic growth and expanding Hong Kong's international network.
  <br>
  <br>
  On tourism, Lee said operations have been smooth since Beijing restored multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents on Sunday, and many people, he said, look forward to visiting the SAR "whenever they want".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted that some trade representatives have expressed optimism that the measure will inject life into the local economy, noting that there are "waves of activities" coming up over the Christmas period.
  <br>
  <br>
  These, Lee said, include Hong Kong WinterFest, international horse races, panda carnivals and a real-life gathering and adventure for an online mobile game this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also said law enforcement agencies are determined to stop the return of parallel goods trading in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said consumption patterns of mainland residents have changed, and nowadays they can find many quality and cheap products through online stores.

    Petaia quits Australian rugby for NFL 'dream'

<img alt="Australia's Jordan Petaia (R) is tackled by Georgia's Mirian Modebadze during the France 2023 Rugby World Cup. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781859_1_20241203112910.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian international Jordan Petaia said Tuesday he has quit rugby to chase his NFL dream, joining a growing list of players setting their sights on the lucrative American sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Petaia has earned 31 caps for the Wallabies since his 2019 debut, and is considered one of Australian rugby's most promising backline talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to step away from rugby hasn't been easy and one that took a great deal of consideration," the 24-year-old said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels like the right time in my career to pursue this dream I've had for a long time," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Kiss, Petaia's club coach at the Queensland Reds, said he was "one of the most dynamic players in Australia, if not the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL said Petaia had joined its International Player Pathway program, which gives stars from other sports the chance to be signed by one of 32 teams in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting in January, he will spend 10 weeks learning the game in Florida before he gets the chance to impress scouts at a "pro day" in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petaia follows in the footsteps of Australian Jordan Mailata, a little-known rugby league player signed by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018 after coming through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mailata, who has impressed during his six years with the Eagles, signed a US$66 million contract extension earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welsh speedster Louis Rees-Zammit stunned the rugby world in January when he quit the sport on the eve of the Six Nations and announced his NFL ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rees-Zammit was used sparingly in pre-season games, and was cut from the Kansas City Chiefs' 53-man playing roster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six athletes have made active rosters for NFL teams after completing the pathway program, according to the NFL. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said anti-subsidy tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles violated the principles of fair competition and free trade during talks with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in Beijing on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China urged Germany and Europe to view its development objectively and rationally, adopt an active and pragmatic policy towards China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baerbock, for her part, said Germany supports the continuation of negotiations between China and the EU to try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  On China-Germany ties, Wang said Beijing has always regarded Berlin as an important partner, and that differences between the two countries should not become obstacles to cooperation or lead to confrontation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister added that their relationship does not target any third party, and should not be subject to influence by any third party. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round next month in a meeting of the competition's two most successful clubs.
 <br>
  <br>
  United are the holders after winning it for the 13th time last season, while Arsenal lifted the last of their record 14 trophies in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie is set for the weekend of January 11-12 at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City, winners in 2023 and runners-up in May, host fourth-tier Salford, owned by United's 'Class of 92' made up of David Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are also at home to League Two opponents in Accrington Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea play Morecambe, the fourth division's bottom side, while Newcastle play other League Two strugglers Bromley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham were drawn away to Tamworth, who are one of only two non-league clubs left in the competition. Fellow National League side Dagenham and Redbridge are away to second-tier Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the third round the 44 clubs from the Premier League and Championship enter the competition, joining the 20 lower-league and non-league sides who won in the previous round. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy will host the Davis Cup Finals from 2025 to 2027, the International Tennis Federation announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight-team men's event, called the "Final 8", was won this year by Jannik Sinner's Italy, who triumphed in Spain last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaga has hosted the event since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to partner with the FITP (Italian Tennis Federation) for the Davis Cup Final 8," said ITF president David Haggerty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Italy has a rich history in tennis and a proven ability to host world-class sporting events," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 finals will be staged in Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are thrilled to have been selected as hosts," Angelo Binaghi, president of the FITP, said. "We look forward to welcoming the best teams in the world to our country next November and for the next three years." (AFP)

    Ronaldo-less Al Nassr suffer first AFC defeat

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo watched on from the stands as already-qualified Al Nassr lost for the first time in this year's Asian Champions League Elite as they were beaten 2-1 in injury time by Qatar's Al Sadd on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese star, 39, was reportedly rested for the fixture in Riyadh given the Saudi club had secured their place in the knockout stages last week, with three rounds of the group phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo scored twice against Al Gharafa, another Qatari side, last time out, and then netted a double again in the Saudi Pro League on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Al Nassr captain was omitted from Stefano Pioli's matchday squad for the visit of Al Sadd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo, who has 15 goals in 18 appearances for his club this season, was spotted at Al Awwal Park sitting alongside his mother Dolores Aveiro and his partner Georgina Rodriguez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Sadd took the lead eight minutes into the second half through Akram Afif, when the reigning AFC Player of the Year raced from the halfway line onto a long ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif outpaced defender Mohammed Al Fatil and finishing low past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr drew level on 80 minutes, once Brazilian youngster Wesley's low cross was turned into his own goal by Al Sadd defender Romain Saiss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there would be a huge sting in the tail for Al Nassr, when Afif was tripped inside the hosts' penalty area and substitute Adam Ounas converted from the spot in the 99th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the defeat, Al Nassr stay third in the Western Region group stage, while Al Sadd move fourth to also claim a spot in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight teams qualify for the knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow Saudi side Al Ahli remain top – even if they surrendered their 100 percent record in this year's tournament – thanks to an Ivan Toney double that secured a 2-2 draw with Iran's Esteghlal in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England striker twice equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot, with the first coming deep into first-half injury time and the second converted in the 86th minute. Esteghlal had Mohammed Hossein Eslami sent off five minutes before.
  <br>
  <br>
  It represented a second successive Champions League Elite match in which Toney has scored twice following his double last week against Asian champions Al Ain. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The future of the planet is at stake during hearings at the top United Nations court, a representative for Vanuatu said on Monday, opening a historic case that aims to set a legal framework on how countries should tackle climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries and organisations are set to present before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the next two weeks, the highest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The outcome of these proceedings will reverberate across generations, determining the fate of nations like mine and the future of our planet," said Vanuatu's representative for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This may well be the most consequential case in the history of humanity," Regenvanu told the 15-judge bench in the panelled hall of the Peace Palace in The Hague.
  <br>
  <br>
  Activists hope the ICJ opinion will have far-reaching legal consequences in the fight against climate change, impacting ongoing court cases as well as domestic and international legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others fear the UN-backed request for a non-binding advisory opinion will have limited impact - and it could take the UN's highest court months, or even years, to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of protesters gathered outside the Peace Palace, near a big screen reading "We are watching".
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators had hung banners saying: "Biggest problem to the highest court" and "Fund our future, climate finance now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The presentations at the scenic Peace Palace come days after a bitterly negotiated climate deal at the COP29 summit in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy polluting countries ultimately agreed to find at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer nations transition to cleaner energy sources and prepare for increasing climate impacts such as extreme weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries condemned the pledge as too little, too late, and the summit's final deal failed to include a global pledge to move away from burning planet-heating fossil fuels. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Michel Barnier faced an abrupt end to his premiership on Monday after key opposition parties said they would back a no-confidence motion against his government after only three months in power.
 <br>
  <br>
  Certain that the National Assembly would deny him a majority backing the government's social security financing plan for next year, Barnier forced through the bill without a vote, using executive powers under article 49.3 of the French constitution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative premier, who formed a minority government in September after an inconclusive general election, has lived under the constant threat of a no-confidence vote that could force him to quit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government could be toppled as early as Wednesday, when a vote is expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier called it "a moment of truth in which everybody must take their responsibilities", warning against lawmakers putting "partisan interests" before the "best interest of the nation".

  <br>
  Far-left opposition party LFI said immediately it would bring a no-confidence motion which the far-right National Rally (RN) - the largest single party in France's parliament - said it would vote in favour of, after accusing Barnier of failing to negotiate on some of the bill's provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any such vote is Marine Le Pen, the parliamentary leader of the RN that has opposed several parts of the government's 2025 budget plan, including the social security financing bill submitted to the assembly on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a last-ditch concession to the RN, Barnier's office said it was scrapping plans for a less generous prescription drug reimbursement policy from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nod to Le Pen's concerns was not enough to avert the no-confidence motion for Barnier, who has little hope of finding any left-wing support. (AFP)

 US stocks had a strong day on Monday, the first trading day in December, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closing at fresh record highs, and the Dow dipping slightly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major Wall Street index to fall on Monday, dipping 0.3 percent to close at 44,782.00.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to close at a new record of 6,047.15, while the Nasdaq rose 1.0 percent to an all-time high of 19,403.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a technical standpoint, the market is still in very good shape," Jack Ablin from Cresset Capital told AFP. "And December also coincides with... a favourable seasonal trend as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're just getting back to a mega cap growth stocks again," Ablin said. "And it may be because investors don't expect rates to come down as quickly as they originally thought."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin said the market was favouring those companies because they have "no debt or very little debt."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And so when they think rates are going to stay high, then they want the companies that aren't borrowing much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Super Micro Computer surged 28.7 percent after a probe into an auditor's concerns about governance and transparency issues found "no evidence" of misconduct at the firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another firm to rise was chip manufacturing equipment firm Applied Materials, which saw its share price rise by 4.9 percent. (AFP)

    Dozens dead in stampede at Guinea football match

<img alt="The football match descends into chaos. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781793_1_20241202220915.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deadly stampede at a football match killed at least 56 people in Guinea's second city N'Zerekore, the government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The events at Sunday's match, which were initially reported as clashes between fans, were triggered after a player was sent off at the end of the game, witnesses said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match in the southeastern city was the final of a tournament organised in honour of Guinea's junta leader, Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup and has installed himself as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition has accused the junta of using sport for political ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses said fans invaded the pitch following the referee's decision, with some attacking the stand designated for officials, prompting the intervention of security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protests of dissatisfaction with refereeing decisions led to stone-throwing by supporters, resulting in fatal stampedes," said a government statement which was read out on national television.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hospital services have put the provisional death toll at 56, with several others injured," it added, describing the incident as a "tragic event".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government assures the public that investigations will be carried out to establish who is responsible for this unfortunate event," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young people also set fire to a police station overnight, according to public television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah condemned the "incidents that marred the match between the teams of Labe and N'Zerekore", in a post on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is following the situation and reiterates its call for calm so as not to impede hospital services from aiding the injured," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that hospital wards and a morgue were overwhelmed by the injured and dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such tournaments and other public gatherings have become common in the West African nation, in what is widely seen as a campaign to promote Doumbouya's candidacy in any future presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military seized power by force in September 2021 by overthrowing civilian President Alpha Conde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under international pressure, the junta pledged to hand power back to a civilian government by the end of 2024 but has since made clear it will not. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

    Court halts Fanling golf course flats plan

<img alt="The High Court says overturning the administration's decision can lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781778_2_20241202200228.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court has overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course, calling on authorities to consult the public on the matter again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Judge Russell Coleman on Monday handed down the judgement after the Hong Kong Golf Club filed a legal challenge against an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report that would set the stage for building public housing units on 9.5 hectares of the century-old course.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said overturning the administration's decision could lead to re-conducting the public consultation and seeking comments from environmental advisers "with the benefits of the fruits of that re-consultation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The club had argued that a public consultation exercise had not been carried out properly or fairly, saying authorities had been allowed to submit additional information during the assessment but people's responses to the submissions were not taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of fact, the public were only consulted on part of the EIA report in its final form. That is contrary to the requirement of the EIA Ordinance," Coleman wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In short, I find that the fairness and integrity of the process, set out in the EIA Ordinance properly construed, demanded re-consultation once the additional information was produced to form part of the EIA report."
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of environmental protection gave conditional approval to the assessment in May last year, before the Town Planning Board rezoned the site from "residential" to "undetermined" use temporarily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials had attached a number of conditions to the assessment's approval, including having the Civil Engineering and Development Department revise its layout plan to preserve about 0.4 hectares of woodland "as far as practicable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said imposing such a condition “subject to the caveat of practicability” was problematic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until the exercise of revision is actually performed, it cannot be known whether the stated current plan [can] be maintained," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the High Court judge also rejected part of the club's contention, including an argument that the approval was unlawful because it failed to require the project proponent to carry out mitigation measures identified in the assessment report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier suspended the environmental review on an interim basis until the judicial challenge was resolved.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Golf Club said it welcomed the judgement, saying the Fanling site is an internationally renowned and world-class venue with significant ecological and cultural value.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The three championship courses – which include the old course – are integral parts of the Fanling site, which is an irreplaceable sports facility and is key to Hong Kong’s ability to attract major golf tournaments," the club said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added the course will host a series of events next year, such as the LIV golf tournament and golf competitions for the National Games, which "play a critical role" in driving the city's sports scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving forward, the club will utilise the three championship courses to the best of their potential with a view to supporting the government policy that advocates the 'shaping of tourism with sports' and the further development of Hong Kong's mega-event economy," the club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Environmental Protection Department said it will study the judgement and announce whether it would appeal "at an appropriate time".

    Consultation on subdivided flats plan begins

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A two-month consultation exercise on proposed regulations aimed at ridding the city of poor quality subdivided flats began on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a housing panel meeting, several lawmakers said they were concerned landlords might start renovations ahead of the new legislation, leaving existing tenants homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, a panel member, said the government needs to take the opportunity to hear what the public thinks about the policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We roll out this policy out of a very good will to ensure the basic humanity level at our housing situation. But if we cannot manage the transition, well I'm afraid ultimately we might cause some people to lose their homes, lose their residences,” he told RTHK after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who leads the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units, said he doesn't think such evictions will be a big problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have talked to different parties earlier and heard about such sayings. But we haven't found any signs of a widespread issue. Also we have emphasised multiple times that under the existing landlord and tenant ordinance, the protection for tenants is still here. If any landlords break the rules and evict their tenants please let us know, we will address that seriously,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the proposed policy, subdivided flats will have to have a floor area of at least eight square metres and a minimum ceiling height of at least 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords caught renting out substandard flats would face jail terms of up to three years, as well as a maximum fine of HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials told lawmakers that they will consult the public on how long the grace period should be for landlords to modify their flats to meet the new requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, some lawmakers said they were worried people might simply switch to renting beds or guest rooms instead, which could be even more cramped than subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the government will look into other relevant policies to address potential issues.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local creative studio is hosting an exhibition called "Panda Go! Fest HK" showcasing 2,500 panda sculptures at various iconic locations across the SAR on weekends in December and during Christmas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony, SK Lam, founder of All Rights Reserved, said the exhibition will be held at the Avenue of Stars, Ngong Ping 360, Ocean Park and Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our past 10 years of experience and also the recent experience we had with [Doraemon], we think these are the more accessible areas that the public can go and visit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said the team has created six new panda characters inspired by the Ocean Park panda family, consisting of Ying Ying and Le Le, new arrivals currently named An An and Ke Ke, as well as the newborn twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the company introduced a giant panda installation a decade ago, featuring 1,600 panda sculptures to symbolise the existing panda population at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that thanks to global conservation efforts, the giant panda population has since increased to over 2,500, encompassing both wild and captive pandas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The local stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.65 percent to close at 19,550.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the gains were driven by encouraging manufacturing data and expectations of continued policy support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentiment was buoyed by data that showed China's factory activity expanded last month, with Beijing's stimulus blitz since September starting to trickle through.

 An impeachment complaint was filed on Monday against Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing a legal storm over a death threat she made against the president, the alleged misuse of government funds by her office and other criminal accusations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The impeachment bid filed by several prominent opponents and activists in the House of Representatives accuses Duterte of violating the country’s Constitution, massive corruption and other “high crimes,” including the death threats she made against the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice president's legal troubles have unfolded in the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in online news conference on November 23 that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned was not a joke.
  <br>
  <br>
  She later said she was not threatening him but was expressing concern for her own safety. (AP)

    HK Island to get 'smart and green' transit line

<img alt="The Transport and Logistics Bureau says the 'smart and green mass transit system' it has opted for is more cost effective than a heavy rail project.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport officials say they hope to kick-start construction projects for a transit line linking HKU and Wong Chuk Hang MTR stations in 2027.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a paper submitted to Legco, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said rather than the heavy rail originally proposed, the new plan for the South Island Line (West) is to build a "smart and green mass transit system" using viaducts, along with a tunnel through the hilly terrain between Queen Mary Hospital and HKU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 7.5-kilometre line will also pass through Aberdeen, Tin Wan, Wah Fu and Cyberport and will serve 130,000 residents and 50,000 people working in the areas, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  No expected completion date was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau said it hopes to begin detailed planning and design for the project next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang, who's a former railway engineer, said he expects construction work to be completed within five to six years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the capacity of the mass transit system is much lower than the original.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new smart [and] green system - capacity could reach around 8,000. But normally the optimal capacity could be something around 5,000," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the capacity, yes, would be a disadvantage. But construction costs would be much much lower."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Georgia fired tear gas and water cannon on Sunday on a fourth straight day of pro-EU protests that drew tens of thousands of people, as the prime minister rebuffed calls for new elections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in October 26 parliamentary polls that the pro-European opposition said were fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil has deepened since Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on Thursday that Georgia was shelving accession talks with the European Union until 2028, sparking a wave of protests in the capital, Tbilisi, and other cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition is boycotting the new parliament, while pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili has asked the constitutional court to annul the election result, declaring the new legislature and government "illegitimate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years, an accusation it denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry has said about 150 demonstrators have been arrested in this latest protest wave, while the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association put the number at 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in some instances have chased protesters through the streets, beating them and firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Waving European and Georgian flags, tens of thousands rallied outside parliament on Sunday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some demonstrators tossed fireworks and stones at riot police, while others banged on the metal door blocking parliament's entrance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later fired water cannon, but were unable to disperse the crowds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late at night, riot police in full gear moved in, using tear gas and water cannon to disperse the rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the opposition United National Movement party, Levan Khabeishvili, told journalists that he was attacked by around 15 masked police officers attempting to detain him, but said he had managed to escape with the help of protesters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another protest took place outside the offices of Georgia's Public Broadcaster, widely accused of acting as a propaganda tool for the ruling party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster conceded to the protesters' demand to grant Zurabishvili airtime, which it had previously denied her.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simultaneous protests took place in cities across Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuelling popular anger, Kobakhidze ruled out new parliamentary elections, saying that "the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this week, the party nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the largely ceremonial post of president.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zurabishvili told AFP in an exclusive interview on Saturday that she would not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels has not recognised the outcome of the October elections, and demanded an investigation into "serious electoral irregularities".
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Parliament has called for a re-run and for sanctions against top Georgian officials, including Kobakhidze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zurabishvili on Saturday said that she was "the only legitimate institution in the country", and that "as long as there are no new elections... my mandate continues".
  <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional law experts have questioned the legitimacy of the new parliament, citing the fact it approved its own credentials in violation of a requirement to await a court ruling on Zurabishvili's bid to annul the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defence and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision to postpone EU accession talks. (AFP)

    Left-wing looks set for gains in Romanian election

<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenged the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on November 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  His unexpected win ushered in support for ultra-nationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at eight percent of economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said Hong Kong would continue to leverage its advantages under the One Country, Two Systems framework and use its global network to become an international education hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made his remarks while addressing the Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit, where attendees included leaders and presidents from more than 50 global universities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our unique advantages spring from One Country, Two Systems. Thanks to this unique principle, we enjoy unwavering support from our country together with global connectivity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong attracts students from more than 100 countries. Over half of the academic staff in our institutions comes from outside Hong Kong. And we are building on that solid foundation, the Hong Kong SAR government endeavors to develop Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE noted the SAR has five universities among the world's top 100, and three in Asia's top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government would continue to promote the “study in Hong Kong brand” as well as encourage local universities to seek more collaboration with overseas and mainland institutions, especially with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same occasion, the director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, said under support from the central government, Hong Kong has upheld its universities' independence and academic freedom since the city's return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope that local universities would work even more closely with their global counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope local universities will seize the opportunity at this forum to deepen their connections with the global higher education sector, enhancing mutual understanding, respect and trust, as well as collaboration in joint programmes and academic exchanges,” Zheng said.

<img alt="Paul Chan has revised the government's budget deficit estimate this year to around HK$100 billion." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781721_1_20241202122432.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion, citing lower revenue mainly due to poor asset market performances.
 <br>
  <br>
  When Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget in February, he forecast a shortfall of a little more than HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told lawmakers on Monday that as well as relatively poor asset market performances, revenue from profits tax is lower because firms aren't doing too well at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the latest estimate was made after considering revenue from government bonds and repayments due.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to geopolitical tensions and other uncertainties, the asset markets continue to be under pressure and this has somewhat affected the revenue from land sales and stamp duty," Chan said at a financial affairs panel meeting in the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to consider our fiscal balance as well as long-term needs of our society. We'll put in place arrangements with a view to restoring fiscal balance in the coming few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials have met credit rating agencies and they agree with the government's assessment that it shouldn't try to reverse the deficit in one to two years as that would "bring a major shock to the society".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the government is conducting transitional fiscal consolidation, mainly by cutting expenditure, while raising revenue is considered to be supportive only.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said US President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies could contribute to global uncertainties next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Trump's threat to impose new tariffs against different countries, including China, could affect Hong Kong's re-exports of mainland goods to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary also reassured lawmakers that they need not worry too much about the government's dwindling fiscal reserves, saying the key is "taking care of our own business".
