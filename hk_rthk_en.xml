 Japanese police were searching on Sunday for the attacker who fatally stabbed a junior high school student and wounded another at a McDonald's restaurant, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teens were in line to order around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the attacker entered the fast-food restaurant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, and wordlessly stabbed them both, according to national broadcaster NHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were rushed to hospital where the girl later died. The other victim, a boy, survived and told police he did not know the man who had stabbed them, NHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear whether the girl knew the man, who remained at large on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of police have deployed to find the attacker, described as a man who appears to be in his 40s, wearing a grey jacket and dark pants, according to Television Nishinippon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack happened in less than a minute, local media reported, adding that around 10 customers were inside the restaurant at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent crime is rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws. But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, two people, including a schoolgirl, were stabbed to death and more than a dozen wounded in the Japanese city of Kawasaki in a rampage by an attacker who targeted children as they waited for a bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 51-year-old attacker slashed at a group of children before fatally stabbing himself. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday urged Hongkongers to "team up for a brighter future" as he invited people to put forward suggestions for his next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  A consultation exercise ahead of the blueprint expected in February got underway on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the government doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said the government has to carefully manage public finances as the global outlook remains gloomy and the city is undergoing economic transformation. But he added that accelerating the city's economic development is of equal importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this period, development is core and stability is the key. The administration has been seeking to expand into new markets and strengthen its position in technological innovation. Results of this are now beginning to flow through," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's make wise use of resources, and team up for a brighter future," he added, in a promotional video on the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the city's market sentiment has been improving, with the central government continuously rolling out measures to support Hong Kong, including bringing back unlimited entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 130,000 mainlanders visited the SAR last weekend, Chan said, adding that this was a 15 percent increase on the average number in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of innovative technology start-ups in the city is continuing to grow and a lot of enterprise founders from across the world agree that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in innovation and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign companies are confident towards Hong Kong. The government's efforts overseas in promoting the city's advantage and telling real Hong Kong stories are yielding positive impacts," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Challenges are inevitable in each development stage, but we have to focus on greater opportunities and prospects. According to our past experiences, Hong Kong remains strong despite highs and lows, and we will continue to make steps forward in new developments and reach newer heights," he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures struggled to reach 15 degrees Celsius across much of the city on Sunday morning, as the observatory warned of the coldest day so far this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A low of 13 degrees was recorded at the forecasters' headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was even colder in parts of the New Territories, the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A strong northeast monsoon will affect the coast of southern China today. Since it will be windy, wind chill effect will be particularly significant on high ground and exposed areas. People are advised to be aware of the change in weather and keep warm when engaging in outdoor activities," it warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that daytime temperatures are expected to rise this week, but mornings will still be cool.

    ABC faces US$15mn payout over Trump lawsuit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 ABC News will pay a US$15 million settlement payment to resolve a defamation lawsuit brought by President-elect Donald Trump, according to court documents filed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit stemmed from on-air comments made by top anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump was found "liable for rape" during an interview with US Representative Nancy Mace that aired in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the settlement require ABC News to make a US$15 million donation to a fund dedicated to "a presidential foundation and museum" for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news organization and Stephanopoulos will also issue public apologies saying they "regret statements" made about Trump during the aforementioned interview, and the broadcaster will pay an addition US$1 million in attorney fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was settled one day after Judge Lisette M. Reid requested depositions from both Trump and Stephanopoulos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had been found liable for sexual abuse -- a different transgression from rape under New York law -- in a 2023 case filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement marks the latest legal victory for Trump since winning the November 5 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a US appeals court granted the dismissal of charges for Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents upon exiting the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith also paused a second federal case regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, although Trump faces racketeering charges over the same issue in a case out of Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  And for Trump's May conviction in the hush money case -- the only criminal charges against him to go to trial -- Judge Juan Merchan has indefinitely postponed sentencing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

 Authorities in Thailand have arrested two men following a bomb blast at a festival near the border with Myanmar that killed three people and wounded dozens, police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An improvised explosive device went off on a dance floor at a festival in Umphang district in Thailand's northern Tak province on Friday night, according to local police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were killed instantly and another died later in hospital, police said. The explosion also injured 48 people among approximately 8,000-9,000 attending the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai police said they had arrested a Thai youth and a man they said was a member of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority rebel group that has fought the Myanmar military for decades for autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar's Karen state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tak police chief Major-General Samrit Ekamol said the Myanmar suspect had thrown the bomb after encountering a "rival gangster" he had previously fought with.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior KNU denied any involvement and said the group did not have any members in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The KNU can call on more than 5,000 fighters, maintains close links with the Thai police and military, and has extensive business interests on both sides of the border, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and urged security agencies to carry out an investigation. (AFP)

 Georgia's ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country's president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected former Manchester City striker Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country's next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote "illegitimate" and refused to step down. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UN envoy on Saturday urged foreign powers to work to avoid a collapse of vital Syrian institutions following the downfall of leader Bashar al-Assad, as diplomats gathered in Jordan for a conference on the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geir Pedersen, the UN's special envoy for Syria, also backed a "credible and inclusive" political process to form the next government as he met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible," Pedersen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Arab, Turkish, EU and US diplomats are holding talks in the Jordanian Red Sea resort city of Aqaba less than a week after Islamist-led rebels toppled Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, on a trip in which he met the leaders of Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, has repeatedly called for an "inclusive" process that reflects all the diverse ethnic and religious communities in Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting Pedersen, Blinken said the United Nations "plays a critical role" in humanitarian assistance and protecting minorities in Syria. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has elaborated on the plan to reform the healthcare system due to population and demographic changes - specifically boosting health management efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau earlier pointed out that even though the overall population in the SAR will increase in 2041, that's not the case for Hong Kong Island, which might drop slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the key components of the plan, is the merging of Hong Kong East and West hospital clusters, which the health chief said would improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Saturday, Lo said the move aims to utilise resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at merging the Hong Kong East and West clusters to co-care for 1.2 million people on Hong Kong Island. This will improve management and administration efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of medical services, it will allow the two to have a strong collaboration through increased cooperation in terms of training and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that services offered by Eastern Hospital would remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the bureau is also looking into adjusting public hospital charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo revealed that critical and emergency patients might be charged less, noting that the government is responsible for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for semi and non urgent patients, he said the authority will offer more a precise subsidy for them.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to remove President Yoon Suk Yeol from office for his failed attempt to impose martial law last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Out of 300 lawmakers, 204 voted to impeach the president on allegations of insurrection while 85 voted against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three abstained, with eight votes nullified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is now suspended from office while South Korea's Constitutional Court deliberates whether to uphold his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in as the interim president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court now has 180 days to rule on Yoon's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it backs his removal, Yoon would become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached.
  <br>
  <br>
  For weeks, thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul to demand Yoon’s resignation and jailing after his short-lived martial law declaration sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers quickly responded, breaking the military cordon and assembling in parliament to vote down the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, prosecutors said they had arrested a military commander who headed the capital defence command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrest warrants were also issued by the Seoul central district court for the national police chief and the head of the city’s police, citing the “risk of destruction of evidence”. (AFP/Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 People flocked to Victoria Park in Wan Chai to enjoy one of Hong Kong's largest outdoor fairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, the Brands and Products Expo opened on Saturday and will run until January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's event saw 900 booths set up, with some offering discounts, including HK$1 special deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lady said she had not been to the fair for many years, and this time, she bought a bag of medicinal herbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a steal. I didn't line up for too long. You can't imagine how happy I am because I got so many things for just HK$1. It would originally cost at least HK$100," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she arrived at the venue four hours early to make sure she got what she was looking for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Abalones and fish maw. I will make soup and other delicious dishes. It's almost new year and also the winter solstice," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also visited the Expo, and bought soup packs, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimps and egg rolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman Wingco Lo said Hong Kong's retail market had been facing various challenges, but with the festive atmosphere and the resumption of the multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, he's confident with the sales from the fair.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up his four-day duty visit to Beijing, making a last stop at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in the capital before returning home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, alongside Chief Secretary Eric Chan who arrived in Beijing on Friday, met Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security, as well as other mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a government statement, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the integrated development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and building the SAR into an international hub for high-calibre talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee reported to the minister that the idea of the committee came from President Xi Jinping, who “pointed out that education development, scientific and technological innovation, and talent cultivation should be promoted as an integrated effort”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He said he hopes that the [Hong Kong] SAR government can create joint forces with the ministry in serving the country’s workforce development strategy and make greater contributions to building a great country in all respects through Chinese modernisation,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the chief secretary, who chairs the committee, said the group would leverage Hong Kong’s strategic positioning and advantages in its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee held its first meeting on Friday and agreed to review and improve existing schemes on attracting high-performing individuals.

    Pandas boost Ocean Park's atmosphere: chairman

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the debut of pandas An An and Ke Ke have boosted the atmosphere at the park, and he expects the facility to see more visitors during festive holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two pandas gifted by the central government earlier made their first appearance to the public, and Pong said tourists from both home and abroad have been lining up to spend time with the animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme on Saturday, the chairman said the park was ready for a visitor boom in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is always a peak. We normally expect more visitors during Christmas and Chinese New Year, and now people are eagerly looking forward to visiting the giant pandas. We know they're going to visit the park during these festivals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said Ying Ying's baby twins are expected to greet visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether visitors would have to pay extra to see the twins, Pong said he had not considered it yet, but stressed that ticketing is integral for Ocean Park's income.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Water World has been closed for a seasonal break this winter, instead of keeping its doors open all year round as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said this allowed better allocation of manpower, so that more staff could help out at Ocean Park when the Water World was having a slack season.

    'HK can expand its market in developing EV'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transformation into green transportation is a new opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its market in developing electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Tse Chin-wan, who told a radio programme that while many countries and regions are promoting green transportation, not many places have double-decker buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities earlier announced a green transformation roadmap of public buses and taxis, with plans to subsidise the purchase of electric buses and taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief stressed that it's worth investing as Hong Kong can make use of the advantage and expand its market in the technology that's involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This green transformation actually provides opportunities under the establishment of a new economy... If we use subsidies to help double-decker buses develop the technology, we can grasp the opportunity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international city and we can set an example for other places."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government shelved the pay-as-you-throw scheme earlier this year, and though some green groups say the scheme should still be rolled out at some point, Tse noted that the authorities would continue to promote waste reduction and recycling rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there are different means to do so, but the ultimate aim is to establish a green-focused culture in society.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

 President Xi Jinping will conduct a three-day visit to Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR’s return to the motherland, Xinhua reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>

  “Xi will also conduct an inspection tour during his stay in the Macau SAR,” the report said.
  <br>

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

    Xi briefed on plans to achieve HK fiscal balance: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he detailed to President Xi Jinping strategies to achieve fiscal balance "in three to five years", after the SAR government warned the deficit would balloon to around HK$100 billion for the current financial year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who was received by the president on the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, added the administration will aim to develop new growth points and grasp the opportunities provided by the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the CE was asked if the president was concerned by the SAR government's fiscal situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have explained the strategies that we will be adopting to ensure that we will eventually make a balanced budget. That may take a few years," Lee replied.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said one way to strengthen the city's economy would be "expanding outside" to markets like Asean and the Middle East, or even Latin America and central Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the nation still offers "the biggest opportunities" for Hong Kong, Lee stressed, and that it's up to the SAR to capitalise on them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee revealed he and the president also discussed safeguarding national security, raising the level of governance, boosting development momentum, and improving people's livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a brief photo call at the start of the closed-door meeting, Xi had affirmed Lee's work and hailed his administration for completing the "historic legislation" of Basic Law Article 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that recognition speaks for itself. I am a believer of there is never the best, only the better. That is also the doctrine advocated by President Xi. In this area, we see things in the same angle," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I have been making reports to him as to how I can create extra synergy, new development, and also create economic growth for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will meet officials from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in Beijing on Saturday, before returning to the SAR on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee hoped the exchange would provide insight to a recently established SAR committee on education, technology and talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group, announced in his policy address, is chaired by the chief secretary.

    France's Macron names centrist ally Bayrou as PM

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Emmanuel Macron on Friday named centrist leader Francois Bayrou as prime minister, handing him the daunting task of hauling France out of months of political crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou, the 73-year-old head of the MoDem group which is allied to Macron's party, was appointed nine days after Michel Barnier's government was ousted by parliament in a historic no-confidence vote following a standoff over an austerity budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President of the Republic has appointed Mr Francois Bayrou as prime minister and tasked him with forming a government," the French presidency said in a statement, giving no more details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou is the sixth prime minister of Macron's mandate after last week's toppling of Barnier, who became France's shortest-serving prime minister and lasted only three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also Macron's fourth prime minister of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayrou now faces an immediate challenge in putting together a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence vote in a deeply divided parliament and thrash out a 2025 budget in a bid to limit economic turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made after Macron received Bayrou for nearly two hours of talks Friday. BFMTV reported the talks with Bayrou had been "tense".
  <br>
  <br>
  Barnier, 73, was expected to hand over power to his successor at a ceremony late on Friday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England were placed in a group with Serbia as the draw for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Europe took place on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As they prepare to begin life under new coach Thomas Tuchel, England were also drawn alongside Albania, Latvia and Andorra in the five-team Group K.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matches will take place between March and November next year, with the group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runners-up in each of the 12 qualifying groups will get a second chance via a series of play-offs, with Europe now contributing a total of 16 nations to the expanded 48-team competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact make-up of the groups is not yet completely clear as it depends on the outcome of the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties will see reigning European champions Spain face the Netherlands, while Germany play Italy, Portugal take on Denmark and France meet Croatia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups in which these teams end up depend on whether they win and progress to the Nations League semi-finals next June, or are eliminated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are six groups of five teams who will begin qualifying in March, while the six groups of four teams will only start next September. (AFP)

    Stiffer penalties mooted for major illegal structures

<img alt="The government is proposing tougher penalties for serious illegal structures, while offering leniency for smaller works such as oversized drying racks. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783391_1_20241213191930.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday a two-fold proposal to handle unauthorised building works, with those convicted of serious breaches facing a maximum jail term of two years and a HK$2 million fine.
 <br>
  <br>
  While stiffer penalties could be introduced for serious contraventions of the Buildings Ordinance, authorities are also rolling out a leniency scheme for minor unlawful works deemed to be low risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau conducted a review of the existing regulations following a spate of incidents where chunks of concrete fell off the exterior facade of ageing buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was also public concern after a landslide exposed unauthorised structures at multiple Redhill Peninsula villas last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposed amendments to the Buildings Ordinance, those who ignore removal orders for "serious unauthorised works", such as an illegal basement, could be jailed for two years, double the current ceiling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum fine would also be raised by 50 percent to HK$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Owners, building professionals or contractors who erect structures without government approval even face a HK$2 million fine, up from HK$400,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau is also proposing to lower the prosecution threshold, such that proceedings could be initiated even when the person concerned doesn't "knowingly" begin construction without permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who inherit illegal structures from the previous owner could still be prosecuted, if they didn't remove them within a certain time frame after the new law is passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relatively minor additions, including retractable awnings and outdoor signboards fixed to the floor, could be performed without prior approval in the future so long as the structures fit the prescribed size and height.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also plan to relax requirements for drying racks for clothes and air conditioner support frames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a three-year grace period for owners to have minor structures inspected by a certified professional. Structures which are approved can be kept.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokeswoman said the policy is aimed at minimising nuisance to the public. But the bureau was also aware of opinions that existing laws are not deterrent enough for serious breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, our resources are limited. So we want to focus our law enforcement efforts on the most serious cases, tackling the bigger illegal structures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which are served to premises aged 30 years or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  A two-month public consultation on the proposal will begin later this month, and the amendment bill could be tabled to the legislature in the first half of 2026.

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says President Xi Jinping showed his affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783388_1_20241213183923.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Friday said Hong Kong needs more long-term planning in connecting its development strategy with that of the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said President Xi Jinping showed affirmation and appreciation towards Chief Executive John Lee and his administration during their exchanges in Beijing on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consultant said Lee was awarded with a high evaluation due to the SAR completing national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law earlier this year, and its efforts in building ties with different countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think particularly [President Xi is] concerned about Hong Kong's international development space, which has been, to a certain extent, shrunk by the United States and the West," Lau told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why President Xi must be happy to see John Lee and his government trying to develop, or to enlarge, Hong Kong's international economic space by developing closer relationships with countries in the Belt and Road Initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi was optimistic on Hong Kong's economy, and he expects "reform" and "innovation" to be the major principles for the city's future governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that it would require long-term planning so that Hong Kong could connect its development strategy with that of the mainland's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan also departed for Beijing to join the chief executive in meeting with relevant ministries in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said President Xi may want Hong Kong to boost its inter-departmental cooperation and also work with the central government to tackle external threats as US President-elect Donald Trump takes office next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That might involve a bigger impact on Hong Kong, and may also involve Hong Kong cooperating with the central authorities so that we can jointly handle the threats coming from Trump and his new administration," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Lee meeting leaders from universities in Beijing, Lau said Hong Kong has to strengthen its exchanges with mainland universities to further enable the city to serve as an educational hub.

    Russian strikes target Ukrainian energy grid

<img alt="Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaking with local residents at the site of a missile strike carried out by Russia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783385_1_20241213182214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Friday said Russia launched a massive aerial attack against the country's energy infrastructure, firing 93 missiles and almost 200 drones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described it as one of the heaviest bombardments on the country's energy sector since the war began almost three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian defences shot down 81 missiles, including 11 cruise missiles that were intercepted by F-16 warplanes, according to Ukrainian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A strong reaction from the world is needed,” Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has repeatedly attempted to cripple Ukraine's electricity system in an effort to disrupt civilian life and Ukrainian defence manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest attack comes as uncertainty surrounds how the war might unfold next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month, has vowed to end the war and has thrown into doubt whether American military support for Kyiv will continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow said on Friday that Trump's opposition to Ukraine firing US-supplied weapons deep into Russia "fully aligned" with Moscow's position.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The statement fully aligns with our position, with our view on the reasons for escalation. It is obvious that Trump understands exactly what is escalating the situation," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry says it carried out the attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in retaliation for Kyiv's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said that air- and sea-based long-range precision weapons and drones were used against "critical facilities of Ukraine's fuel and energy infrastructure that support the military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar massive attack on November 28 involved about 200 missiles and drones and left more than a million households without power until emergency teams restored supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia also said on Friday that discussions of possibly deploying European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine to guarantee a future ceasefire were premature, and added it wanted peace rather than simply a truce. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has praised Chief Executive John Lee for implementing the city’s domestic national security law and shoring up the global influence of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi, who received Lee on Friday during the third day of his duty visit to Beijing, also said the central government fully recognised the work of the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the past year, you have led the SAR government to be responsible and pragmatic in completing the historic legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, focusing on economic development and promoting solutions to people’s livelihood issues such as housing and healthcare,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have strengthened external exchanges and cooperation, which not only enhanced the international influence [of Hong Kong], but also further consolidated the great momentum of Hong Kong’s stable development. The central government fully affirms your work and that of the SAR government.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also said central authorities fully support the SAR government in leading Hong Kong to seek reforms and make greater contributions to the city’s prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee thanked Xi for his continued care and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the halfway point of the term for the current government. It is a critical period for leading Hong Kong to move forward, and to inherit the past and usher in the future. It is also an important moment to make great contributions to the building of a great country through Chinese modernisation,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has seen results in different areas over the past two and half years, Lee said, with global rankings of the city reflecting the confidence in the SAR and proving that the policy direction is correct.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the senior leaders at the meeting were Premier Li Qiang; Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang; and Cai Qi, director of the central committee’s general office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong were also present.

 The Hang Seng Index ended the week on Friday sharply lower, finishing down 2.09 percent to close at 19,971, its biggest decline in a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday proposed amendments to road traffic regulations to improve road safety and keep up with new technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the changes is requiring electric vehicles to have acoustic warning systems to alert pedestrians. Private cars will also need to use child restraining devices, while vehicles with extendable aerial structures must have over-height warning systems installed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposals also include allowing remote control parking features and camera-monitor systems as alternatives to traditional mirrors. Electric commercial vehicles will also be permitted to use expressways without special permits under the new rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a Transport and Logistics Bureau spokesman said the government will continue updating regulations as needed to keep pace with evolving technologies and international standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim to create a safer and more convenient road environment for road users in Hong Kong through optimising vehicle design and construction standards with the amendment regulations," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amendments will be tabled to the Legislative Council next Wednesday for negative vetting.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday said he saw "encouraging signs" of progress towards a ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza Strip on a visit to Turkey.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about the imperative of Hamas saying 'yes' to the agreement that's possible, to finally help bring this to an end. And we appreciate very much the role that Turkey can play in using its voice with Hamas to try to bring this to conclusion."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed I think the opportunity... to get a ceasefire [in Gaza] in place. And what we've seen in the last couple of weeks are more encouraging signs that is possible," Blinken said after meeting Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two diplomats also discussed the situation in Syria which is in a state of flux following the fall of president Bashar al-Assad last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fidan said that possible Turkish and US roles for Syria's future were among the topics they discussed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Turkey's priority in Syria is ensuring the stability and prevention of domination by groups deemed terrorists after the ouster of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken said it was "imperative" to work against a resurgence of the Islamic State group in Syria post-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country worked very hard... to ensure the elimination of the territorial caliphate of ISIS, to ensure that that threat doesn't rear its head again. And it's imperative that we keep at those efforts," Blinken said in Ankara at a press conference with Fidan. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said training its spokespersons on how to communicate with the public and family members after medical incidents occur is necessary.
 <br>
  <br>
  This recommendation of setting up a spokesperson preparedness programme comes from a review committee tasked with improving the authority’s management, which put forward various suggestions last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration had earlier ordered the authority to review its management following a spate of medical blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau told a Legco panel meeting on Friday that it’s impossible to avoid medical incidents entirely, highlighting the incident rate in Hong Kong is much lower than in other advanced healthcare systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Ko, the authority’s chief executive, added that proper communication to avoid misunderstanding is more important.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must understand that adverse clinical outcomes do happen. That is the same everywhere. The point is to communicate the incident well to the public, the family members and our internal staff members to be transparent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On this, we think training is needed. Most of the time, we focus our training on medical training. So there's room for improvements in terms of communication skills. That's why we will follow up on this recommendation seriously.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the other recommendations put forward by the review committee is for a high-level reform committee, which will be formed and led by the HA’s chairman Henry Fan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers asked the HA for a clear timeline on the committee's formation and whether legislators could get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko said the HA has begun its work on this issue, noting that no more details can be given at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liberal Party lawmaker Peter Shiu, who's also a former Eastern District Council member, expressed concern about the authority’s plan to merge the Western and Eastern Hong Kong Island hospital clusters, saying he’s heard people worry that some hospitals would be shut down after the integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo assured the legislator that hospital services will remain unaffected, noting the cluster is designed to cater to the population distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In 2041, there should be 8.5 million people in Hong Kong. A cluster would serve one-seventh of the population. So I think that is necessary for us to review and make adjustment. By integrating the two clusters, the Eastern Hospital services will not be affected. There could even be improvement because upon integration, the management and administrative efficiency will be enhanced,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel’s chair Chan Hoi-yan, for her part, raised concerns over the rising expenditure of the HA, noting the authority will receive over HK$95 billion in subsidies this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Lo mentioned that healthcare expenditures make up only 3.9 percent of the SAR’s GDP, which is quite low by global standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister said Hong Kong is well-known for the cost-effectiveness of its healthcare system, but also noted that an ageing population and implementation of new healthcare technologies are putting a strain on finances.

 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will decide whether and when to conduct military exercises in accordance with its needs and the situation on the ground, a defence spokesperson said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks when responding to media questions on military drills following Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's recent transit through Hawaii and Guam, emphasising the PLA's unwavering resolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu reaffirmed the PLA's mission to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and defend the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any attempt to split the nation through soliciting external support or resorting to force will be punished, and will never succeed," Wu said. (Xinhua)

    Govt urged to subsidise installation of taxi cameras

<img alt="Taxi drivers are required to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783335_2_20241213134537.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has been urged to subsidise taxi drivers to help them install surveillance cameras while providing more education for cabbies struggling to adapt to new electronic payment systems.
 <br>
  <br>
  This follows a legislative proposal to require taxi drivers to install CCTV cameras in their vehicles by the end of 2026, and implement electronic payment methods by late 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel on Friday, newly appointed transport minister Mable Chan said the proposal had been well-received by the public and the taxi trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proposing a win-win situation for passengers, taxi drivers as well as the entire taxi trade. We will be able to enable all passengers to have a better travelling experience with these systems. We will also be able to increase the deterrent effect for the black sheep in the trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Ryan Wong who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi Council, said he’s worried about rising operational costs and urged the government to consider subsidising CCTV camera installations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said while the industry generally welcomes introducing e-payment means, some taxi drivers may not be familiar with digital platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some drivers may not be very familiar with using these platforms, which is a bit worrying. But we believe that through education and even workshops to provide information, this problem can be solved," he told reporters before the panel meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick said he doesn't think privacy is an issue as the government has implemented a system in which camera footage can only be accessed by authorised personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at all other public transport in Hong Kong, they already have a CCTV camera there. So I think you have to remember, even within the taxi cab, it's not a totally private place. It's semi-private. So I think the most important thing is to make sure the passengers are aware that the CCTV system is on," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton stars Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet on Friday crashed out of the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, falling to the national team's Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin in three games.
 <br>
  <br>
  That result could be the end of the road for the SAR pair, with Tse having already hinted at retirement earlier this year as she continues to battle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei pulled ahead late to win the opening game, 21-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Tang and Tse to bounce back, though, claiming a nail-biting 21-19 victory in the second to force a winner-take-all third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by six at the break, the SAR pair put up a fight by scoring six straight points to cut the deficit at 14-11.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jiang and Wei pulled away to seal a 21-15 victory to round out the 63 minute match-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong duo finished group play with one win and two losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei will join compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in the knockout round, which begins on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest chess world champion on Thursday after beating defending champion Ding Liren of China in the final match of their series in Singapore.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju, 18, secured 7.5 points against 6.5 of his Chinese rival in the contest, surpassing the achievement of Russia’s Garry Kasparov who won the title at the age of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian teen prodigy has long been considered a rising star in the chess world after he became a chess grandmaster at 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had entered the match as the youngest-ever challenger to the world crown after winning the Candidates tournament earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After securing victory, Dommaraju burst into tears and raised his arms in celebration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years. I am happy that I realised the dream (and made it) into reality,” he told reporters after his win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju is now the second Indian to win the title after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand, who has been a mentor to Dommaraju, said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the 18-year-old on his “remarkable accomplishment,” calling it “the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s match was a 14-round long-time classical event with a prize fund of US$2.5 million. (AP)

 A memorial ceremony was held in Nanjing on Friday in honour of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mourners gathered at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders to remember those killed by invading Japanese forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers placed numerous large floral wreaths on stage, before the national anthem was played and a moment of silence held to a lowered national flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed during the six-week massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as National Memorial Day, to ensure the massacre is not forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, there are only 32 living registered survivors of the massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1945, the war against Japan came to an end as Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender in the Second World War. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung said on Friday that the best way to restore order in the country is to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol, a day ahead of a planned parliamentary vote over Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  A vote by South Korea's parliament on whether to impeach President Yoon over his martial law decree has been moved to 4pm on Saturday, the speaker's office said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the national significance and gravity of the matter, the plenary session was finalised for 4pm to allow adequate time for thorough discussions and consultations," the National Assembly Speaker's Office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's move to impose military rule on December 3 was rescinded before six hours but it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and widespread calls for him to step down for breaking the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon on Thursday vowed to "fight to the end," blaming the opposition party for paralysing the government and claiming a North Korean hack into the election commission made his party's crushing defeat in an April parliamentary election questionable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee called Yoon's remarks "a declaration of war" against the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It proved that impeachment is the fastest and the most effect way to end the confusion," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon survived the first attempt to impeach him last Saturday when most of his ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then some PPP members have publicly supported a vote to impeach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition parties, which control the single-chamber parliament, have introduced another impeachment bill and plan to hold a vote on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They need at least eight PPP members to join to pass the bill with the two-third majority required. (Reuters)

    Trump extends invite to Xi for his inauguration

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has invited President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to kick off trading for the day, that he had been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration” without referring to any specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came soon after his incoming White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed during a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends” that Trump had invited Xi and other world leaders to attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  No head of state has previously made an official visit to the US for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented invitations come at a moment when much of the world is bracing for what comes next when Trump and his “America First” world view return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has vowed to levy massive tariffs against the United States' chief economic competitor, China, as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico - citing illegal immigration and illegal drugs as a factor in his decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danny Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said President Xi would not allow himself to “be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded, “I have nothing to share at present.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s January 20 inauguration is set to take place a day after the US deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City captain Kyle Walker has called for tough action to tackle online abuse after he received a "vile, racist and threatening" message following Wednesday's 2-0 loss at Juventus.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walker played the whole European Champions League match in Turin but could not help Pep Guardiola's team avoid a seventh defeat in 10 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international posted a screenshot of a message he received on Instagram from an unnamed user to his social media accounts on Thursday that used obscene racist language.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one should ever be subjected to the sort of vile, racist and threatening abuse I have received online since last night's match," Walker wrote on his X and Instagram accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instagram and the authorities need to stop this happening for the sake of all who are suffering this abuse – it is never acceptable," he went on to say. "To our fans, we will continue to work as a team to do better, to improve and to turn the corner together."
  <br>
  <br>
  City condemned the racist attack. A club statement read: "Manchester City strongly condemns the racist abuse that Kyle Walker was subject to online following last night's fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We refuse to tolerate discrimination of any kind – regardless of whether that be in stadiums or online," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League also weighed in, saying in a statement that "racism has no place in the game or anywhere in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage anyone who hears or sees discriminatory abuse to report it so action can be taken," it wrote. "The Premier League will support Kyle Walker and the club to tackle online hate." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund fired Manchester United to a 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League as Chelsea beat Astana 3-1 in the Europa Conference League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's United side came from behind to best the Czech side thanks to a second-half brace by Danish striker Hojlund, provisionally moving to fifth in the league phase standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top eight finish will see United qualify automatically for the round of 16, while finishing ninth to 24th will earn them a play-off tie to reach that stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matej Vydra opened the scoring three minutes after half-time to stun United, before substitute Hojlund scored twice in the last half-hour to seize a vital three points for the English club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner came two minutes from time when Bruno Fernandes cleverly slipped a free-kick into the 21-year-old's feet and he held off a defender before slipping home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Europa League, Roma beat 10-man Braga 3-0 thanks to goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Saud Abdulhamid and Mario Hermoso to move to 12th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic Bilbao top the standings with 16 points after beating Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 2-0 on Wednesday courtesy of an Inaki Williams double.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a much-changed Chelsea side battled the frigid conditions in Kazakhstan and won to all but guarantee a top-eight finish in the league phase, which would ensure automatic qualification to the round of 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a solid performance," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. "We knew it was quite cold – we tried to adapt quickly. The players did fantastically with the weather conditions and long journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea sit top of the standings on 15 points, three ahead of Fiorentina in second and Legia Warsaw who lost to Switzerland's Lugano to break their perfect record in the competition. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US equity markets dipped fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq retreating below 20,000 following a US inflation report that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US wholesale inflation came in at 0.4 percent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 percent in October and higher than projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the inflation report, markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we're seeing profit-taking after a big day," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research, who viewed the inflation report as unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dropped 0.7 percent to 19,902.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 percent to 43,914.12, while the S&P 500 also shed 0.5 percent to 6,051.25.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock indices have scored repeat records since Donald Trump won the November 5 presidential election. The Republican took a victory lap on Thursday morning, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Adobe tumbled 13.7 percent on disappointment over the software giant's forecast for next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Warner Bros. Discovery surged 15.4 percent as it announced a reorganization, with one major division focused on operating television networks and the other focused on streaming and movie studios. (AFP)

 The West Kowloon Cultural District is bringing the holiday spirit to life with the opening of its Christmas Market, which is set to run until December 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The market features around 30 specialty stalls selling a wide variety of festive treats, drinks and holiday gifts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jenny, a visitor to the market, said she’s enjoying the bustling atmosphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since it's been this lively," she said.

  "It's really nice because it makes for a good atmosphere, you can just sit and talk to your friends."

 The government said it has submitted requests to extend the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and are awaiting approval from the mainland authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The requests include overnight service at the Shenzhen Bay port and extended hours at the Lo Wu checkpoint until 2am from the current 12am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Huanggang checkpoints will operate round the clock as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government’s inter-departmental working group on festival arrangements held a meeting on Thursday ahead of the upcoming festive period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who chairs the group, said he expects a significant influx of visitors during New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said SAR officials will do all they can to facilitate tourist flow and ensure smooth operations at the various border checkpoints.

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers over the next six weeks in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

    Plaza Hollywood cinema likely to close on Friday

<img alt="Many people said they have fond memories of the cinema in Plaza Hollywood. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783222_1_20241212190641.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cinema in Diamond Hill will likely cease operations on Friday, potentially becoming the seventh movie theatre to close this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Even though the MCL branch at Plaza Hollywood hasn’t made an official announcement yet, the cinema has suspended ticket-selling on its website and its ticket counters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanning 38,000 square feet, the cinema has six halls with a total capacity of almost 1,600 seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  While staff members at the cinema refused to comment on the reported closure, they conceded that "operation of the cinema will temporarily pause from Friday".
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those paying a potential last visit to MCL Cinemas PLUS+ Plaza Hollywood was Shaun, a university student.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe because of people heading north or the internet is growing fast, not many people are coming to the cinemas. But I love watching movies inside cinemas, that's why I'm quite distressed," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diana, who’s lived in the housing complex above the mall for over two decades, said the cinema means a lot to her.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just get in the lift and come here within ten minutes. It's very convenient ...it's very causal and easy,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Also, during my childhood, my parents often brought me to watch movies during the weekends and so this is a habit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another nearby resident, 76-year-old Raymond, said he’s been a big fan of the cinema.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's such a pity. There's only this cinema in the area. I am an elderly and this cinema offers discounts for senior citizens until 1:30pm. I once watched five movies in a week," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least six cinemas have closed this year, including the almost six-decade old President Theatre in Causeway Bay.

    Bulgaria and Romania fully integrated into Schengen

<img alt="Bulgaria and Romania are now fully integrated into Europe's vast Schengen area of free movement. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783219_1_20241212184750.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union ministers on Thursday agreed to let Bulgaria and Romania fully integrate into Europe’s ID-check free travel zone, known as the Schengen area, by lifting land border controls from next year, the EU's Hungarian presidency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria and Romania joined the Schengen area in March after years of negotiations, providing free access for travellers arriving in both countries by air or sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, land border checks remained in place due to opposition, chiefly from Austria, over concerns the two countries were not doing enough to prevent migrants from entering without authorisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Interior ministers have just adopted a decision to lift internal land border controls with and between Bulgaria and Romania,” the Hungarian presidency posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A great victory for Bulgaria, Romania, and all of Europe!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Land border checks will end from January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romania’s Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the decision would be a “major benefit” to his country’s economy and enable “faster journeys home for the millions of Romanians” living and travelling within the Schengen area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freedom of movement is central to European integration.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 420 million people live in the Schengen area, and their freedom to move across borders helps businesses and tourism to flourish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Romanian President Klaus Lohannis called it a “natural and necessary step” that will significantly reduce wait times at borders, lower logistical costs for businesses, and raise attractiveness to foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Schengen membership has been a strategic objective for our country,” he said in a statement. “Over time, there have been numerous obstacles, despite Romania’s technical readiness to meet Schengen standards for many years.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Romania would “continue to act responsibly to protect and strengthen the EU’s external borders” to manage illegal migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Schengen Area was established in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before Bulgaria and Romania’s partial admission, it comprised 23 of the 27 EU member countries, along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 3.5 million people cross an internal border each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the main achievements of the European project.
  <br>
  <br>
  It started as an intergovernmental project between five EU countries– France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and has gradually expanded to become the largest free travel area in the world. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting and six other defendants were on Thursday convicted of rioting in Yuen Long during the 2019 protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty for their roles in clashes inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21 that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his verdict, District Court judge Stanley Chan said the former Democratic Party lawmaker had "fanned the flames" by going to the station and asking his assistant to livestream the events there.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecution had said that the defendant was using his capacity as a legislator to lead a group of protesters to provoke a rival group dressed in white.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, 47, had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been serving a separate sentence of six years and nine months for subversion, for his role in an unsanctioned Legco primary.

    Surge in cases involving impersonation of officials

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday reported a surge in cases involving the impersonation of officials, with nearly 900 scams reported in the initial 10 months of this year, marking a 12 percent increase from the previous period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they received 874 cases that amounted to HK$1.42 billion, more than double from previous figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Theodora Lee, the superintendent at the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre of the Commercial Crime Bureau, said that 30 percent of victims were university students, adding that scammers have adopted novel tactics to deceive people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scammers are getting more aggressive. In recent cases, we have seen scammers demanding students to take nude photos or videos and hide in remote areas. In one case, they even requested a victim leave Hong Kong for Thailand and cut off contact with their families," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tactics were aimed at pressuring the students' parents for more money."
  <br>
  <br>
  One victim who is a master's student in the SAR said she travelled to the mainland, and handed over 500,000 yuan in cash to the scammers, after she was informed by scammers dressed in police uniforms with identification that she was involved in a money laundering case.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was then directed to Thailand, where she was told she was prohibited from contacting anyone.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the scammers later falsely informed her parents that she had been kidnapped and demanded a 10 million yuan ransom.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her parents reported the incident, and she was eventually found in a Bangkok hotel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there were 36,405 cases of fraud from January to October this year, involving a sum of over HK$7 billion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

    'HK exports to see 4 percent growth in 2025'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The captain of Hong Kong, China men's team, James Christie, on Thursday said the squad would be looking to build on their recent success in Asia as they enter the final stretch of training in the run-up to the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having been named as the successor to Max Woodward in September, Christie weighed in on what the opportunity to lead Hong Kong meant to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always said I'm not much of a talker," Christie said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not much difference between being a player and a captain – I need to lead from the front a bit more, but I like to lead through the games and matches that I play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, 28, has already tasted early success in leading the SAR to a clean sweep of victories during the Asia Rugby Sevens Series this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the SAR defeated Japan in the final of the last leg of the tournament in Thailand, repeating its earlier successes in China and South Korea, to become the first side to win all of its 15 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Christie said the team's eyes are on the bigger prize on home soil, as the annual tournament makes its debut at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge motivation, the new facilities look fantastic," said Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking forward to running out a new spot with a new team and new faces, so hopefully, it'll be all good."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also added that fitness, skills, and cohesion are major aspects that the team are looking to polish up on ahead of the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chloe Chan, the new co-captain of the women's side, said she wants to encourage her teammates on and off the field, to ensure that the team bonds well together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really want our team to come together and perform and do well in the Challenger Series," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for veteran co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne, she said she's looking forward to working with a new partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chloe Chan has actually been on the leadership group for quite a while, so she has stepped up. She's been a leader multiple times before, so I see it going quite smoothly," Olson-Thorne told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She's got a lot of experience and a lot of positivity leading into the team environment."
