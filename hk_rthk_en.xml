<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Tuesday said three more children are in intensive care with severe flu.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the centre said the first case involved a six-year-old boy with good past health. It said his household contacts so far have no symptoms and there was no flu outbreak at his school.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second involves a 12-year-old boy with an underlying illness. He lives in a school dormitory and seven other students from the same school recently had upper respiratory symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The above-mentioned two boys had no travel history during the incubation period. An initial investigation revealed that they did not receive 2024/25 SIV [seasonal influenza vaccine]," a spokesman for the CHP said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third case is an eight-year-old boy with good past health. He was diagnosed with flu and another serious infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre says this brings to eight the number of severe flu cases in children, since the flu season began this month. It said six of the children were unvaccinated against seasonal flu.

 An Air Busan plane caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in Busan in South Korea on Tuesday while preparing for departure to Hong Kong. All 169 passengers and seven crew members evacuated without casualties, Yonhap news agency reported, citing authorities.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire began in the plane's tail, Yonhap said, adding that one person was injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a month since the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil when a Jeju Air plane coming from Bangkok crashed on Muan Airport's runway as it made an emergency belly landing, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budget airline Air Busan is part of Asiana Airlines, which in December was acquired by Korean Air. (Reuters)

    'DeepSeek may not cause shift in flow of global funds'

<img alt="A local finance expert says the release of DeepSeek is a good thing for the development of artificial intelligence. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789484_1_20250128184931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial experts in Hong Kong on Tuesday said low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model DeepSeek may not necessarily cause a shift in the flow of global funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the AI assistant led to a sell-off in Nvidia shares, which fell 17 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$600 billion from the AI chip market leader’s market value – a record one-day loss for any company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The startup behind DeepSeek said it uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available, a comment that has garnered attention worldwide, and sparked speculation that global investors will look for cheaper AI options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, pointed out that intense competition is commonplace in the AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what we have seen from DeepSeek is the fact that the Chinese have innovated using older chips and being able to use them by understanding the architecture better and linking them better together," Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's difficult to see how utilising old chips is really going to keep up with the modern advances that we're seeing in the current generation and the next reiteration of the Nvidia chips, so I think there's still going to be a lot of competition there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almagest Asset Management chief executive James Wong said DeepSeek’s emergence is a good thing for the development of AI, but he did not think it would cause a significant change in terms of global capital flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't come as a surprise for us that the cost of developing the model R1 is that much less than the cost that OpenAI is running," Wong said, using the name of DeepSeek’s open-source AI model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the city's Hang Seng Index rose for the third straight session in a row, increasing 0.1 percent to close at 20,225, partially boosted by the optimism generated by DeepSeek. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four more South African soldiers have been killed in fighting against the M23 rebel group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the defence force said on Tuesday, after nine were killed last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three soldiers were killed in fighting near Goma airport on Monday and another died after being wounded in an earlier battle, the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The M23 rebels launched... a mortar bomb in the direction of Goma Airport, which landed in the SANDF base, and this resulted in the SANDF losing three members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, the SANDF is also saddened to announce that one of our members who was injured during the battle with M23 rebels over the past three days later succumbed to injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  The SANDF announced on Saturday that nine South African soldiers, including two from the UN peacekeeping force MONUSCO, were killed in clashes with M23 forces on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa has also deployed troops to a regional force sent by the Southern African Development Community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting has raged in Goma despite calls from the international community for the Rwandan-backed M23 to halt its advance on the city which is in a mineral-rich part of the vast DRC and is home to more than a million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were conflicting accounts over how much of Goma remained under Congolese control after the M23 group and Rwandan soldiers entered the city centre on Sunday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SANDF remains fully committed to its peacekeeping responsibilities under the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) and SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (SAMIDRC)," its statement said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday visited a Lunar New Year fair in Tuen Mun, before the fairs end early tomorrow morning on the first day of the Year of the Snake.
 <br>
  <br>
  He bought 10 gladiolus, or sword lilies, which symbolise perfectness and moving forward, along with a pinwheel for good deeds and good luck, and an ornament that represents connecting the community together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press, Lee said he thinks business at the fair will improve later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popularity of stalls and products differ. Some are doing well, while some are still struggling. I believe when it gets darker, business at the fair will get better as we get closer to the New Year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee gave citizens his best wishes and called for Hongkongers to shop at the fair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be the Year of the Snake tomorrow. The snake is agile, which indicates that Hong Kong will seek and respond to changes. I wish everyone good luck, have a great time during the Lantern Festival and other activities, and also good health," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan went to a fair at Victoria Park, where he chatted with a few stall owners and took pictures with citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent around HK$1,000 to purchase a giant panda plush toy, a cushion, a pinwheel, and some orchids.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said he hopes more citizens will visit Lunar New Year fairs across the city ahead of the festival.

 Vendors were on the fence on Tuesday about how much revenue they would generate as people flocked to wet markets to buy food for their family reunion dinners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve is traditionally regarded as the most important meal of the year in Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  One man said he spent over HK$1,000 shopping at the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I picked up things like clams and shrimp. They are a little pricier this year, about 10 percent more than last year. But it’s New Year, so that’s expected,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vegetable seller at Kowloon City Market said business was pretty rough overall, noting that lettuce was the only top seller because it symbolises the generation of wealth in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a poultry vendor at the same market was not worried about her sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People usually buy one or two chickens and don’t mind the price. They are willing to spend big as long as the chickens are fresh. Whether it’s HK$300, HK$400 or HK$500 it doesn’t matter,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “During New Year, everything is a bit pricier and that’s just part of the festive atmosphere. People don't even bother asking about the price.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business activity for the catering sector was better than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while many Hongkongers travel to the mainland during the holiday, those who stay in the city are more willing to dine out.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Overall, I believe business over the Lunar New Year holiday is more than 10 percent better than last year,” he said.

    Trump bans 'transgender ideology' from military

<img alt='US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to get what his administration calls "transgender ideology" out of the military. Photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789451_1_20250128160041.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Monday said he had signed an executive order ridding the military of what he called "transgender ideology," in a potentially major setback for LGBT rights.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a series of orders related to the military that Trump told reporters he had signed on Air Force One, he also called for the building of a US version of Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican signed further orders reinstating service members dismissed for refusing to take the Covid vaccine, and extending a wider government crackdown on diversity programmes to the armed forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military," Trump told a Republican Congressional retreat earlier in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has previously promised to bring back a ban on transgender troops and demonised any recognition of gender diversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his order, Trump claimed the armed forces "have been afflicted with radical gender ideology to appease activists" and that "many mental and physical health conditions are incompatible with active duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  The order said "adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life."
  <br>
  <br>
  "A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honour this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The orders came at the start of Trump's second week back in the White House and on the day a welcome ceremony was held at the Pentagon for his new defence secretary, military veteran and Fox News personality Pete Hegseth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for your leadership Mr President. We will execute!" Hegseth -- who was confirmed last week despite concerns over his inexperience, and alleged record of heavy drinking and domestic violence -- said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgender Americans have faced a roller coaster of changing policies on military service in recent years, with Democratic administrations seeking to permit them to serve openly while Trump has repeatedly sought to keep them out of the ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military lifted a ban on transgender troops serving in the armed forces in 2016, during Democrat Barack Obama's second term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under that policy, trans troops already serving were permitted to do so openly, and transgender recruits were set to start being accepted by July 1, 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the first Trump administration postponed that date to 2018 before deciding to reverse the policy entirely, sparking criticism from rights groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's Democratic successor Joe Biden moved to reverse the restrictions just days after he took office in 2021, saying all Americans qualified to serve should be able to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the number of transgender troops in the US military is fairly small -- with estimates of around 15,000 out of more than two million uniformed service members -- their dismissal would reduce US forces at a time when the country is already facing difficulties recruiting new personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden's defence secretary Lloyd Austin appeared to criticise Trump's plans during a farewell address earlier this month, saying: "Any military that turns away qualified patriots who are eager to serve is just making itself smaller and weaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Transgender issues have roiled US politics in recent years, as states controlled by Democrats and Republicans have moved in opposite directions on policies ranging from medical treatment to what books on the topic are allowed in public or school libraries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has meanwhile repeatedly promised to build a version of the Iron Dome system that Israel has used to shoot down missiles fired by Hamas from Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he ignored the fact that the system is designed for short-range threats, making it ill-suited to defending against intercontinental missiles that are the main danger to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield," Trump said in Miami, adding that it would be "made right here in the USA." (AFP)

 Chief Executive John Lee issued a Lunar New Year message on Tuesday, saying that Hong Kong would be agile and resilient in the Year of the Snake, and would continue to seek innovation and change.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the pre-recorded message, John Lee said the city has had a year full of cheer, including the gift of two giant pandas from Beijing and the birth of two panda cubs - which will greet the public in mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video also featured various snake and panda decorations, along with a variety of Lunar New Year specialities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also wished good health and good fortune to Hongkongers in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year is the Year of the Snake - which is nimble and agile, and symbolises prosperity and wealth. This year, Hong Kong will again show off its agility, and resilience, with flexible thinking - to innovate, reform and develop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My wife and I wish Hong Kong's people good health in the Year of the Snake. May you have joy, prosperity and good fortune," he added.

    Cross-border bus services up by 20pc during LNY

 Cross border coach operators will increase their frequency of services by 20 percent over the Lunar New Year holiday, the Hong Kong Guangdong Boundary Crossing Bus Association said today.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice chairman Freeman Cheung told an RTHK radio programme that he expects the city to see the highest number of Hongkongers heading north on Thursday and Friday, while the number of travellers returning from the mainland is expected to peak on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Usually, cross-border coaches are less than 50 percent full. But during the Lunar New Year holiday and other festivities, this can rise to 80 percent - or even 100 percent,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung welcomed the government's decision not to operate border checkpoints beyond the usual hours during the period, as he expects there will only be a slightly higher flow of tourists on the second day of the holiday due to the fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes by arranging more coaches at hotspots such as Wan Chai, West Kowloon and Prince Edward an hour after the fireworks show – which he expected to be the peak period of travellers heading home – they would be able to divert the flow of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the move would allow operators to allocate more resources for the rush hour during the daytime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, local florist Yeung Siu-lung pointed out that business had improved by 10 percent compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he had not raised prices in recent years amid the poor economy and inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from selling orchids at the Victoria Park flower market, he also grows and sells them in Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people who buy more flowers tend to drive, and they get pots. Why do I say business is up by 10 percent this year? It's because the old customers have recommended the market to new customers. There are more unfamiliar faces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also said that there was a need to boost sales to make customers happy on the final full day of the market, before it closes tomorrow morning.

 A Hong Kong resident who had been detained for illegal work in Myanmar returned to the SAR late Monday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Accompanied by members of a government task force, the man arrived at the Hong Kong International Airport via a flight from Bangkok. He was subsequently taken to the airport police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a press briefing, Assistant Secretary for Security Paddy Yuen said the man is very happy to be back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was grateful to see us head to Thailand to follow up on his case, and very excited to be able to return to Hong Kong, and reunite with his family before the Lunar New Year," Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said he won’t disclose additional details of the case, including whether a ransom was paid, to avoid complicating the future course of action.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Chinese diplomats in Southeast Asia, as well as local authorities for assisting in the rescue operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuen added that work is still underway to bring the rest of the victims home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also remember that there are still ten Hong Kong residents who have not been released," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The assistant security chief reminded Hongkongers to stay vigilant against job offers that promise high salaries without the need for professional skills, or require the person to transport goods between places.

    Neymar tipped to return to Santos after Al-Hilal exit

<img alt="Neymar was held to just seven games in two seasons for Al-Hilal due to injuries. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789417_1_20250128094813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian star Neymar has ended his injury-plagued 18-month stay in Saudi Arabia as his club, Al-Hilal said they had "agreed to terminate the player's contract by mutual consent".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The club expresses its thanks and appreciation to Neymar for what he has provided throughout his career with Al-Hilal, and wish the player success in his career," said a club statement posted on social media," the team said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain forward played just seven times since joining the club in August 2023, despite a reported salary of around US$104 million a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neymar, the subject of what is still the biggest transfer in football history when he joined Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona in 2017 for a fee of US$230 million, joined Al-Hilal in August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He followed fellow superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema to the lucrative Saudi league.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two months after his arrival in Riyadh, he ruptured a cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing for Brazil in a World Cup qualifier in October 2023, which kept him on the sidelines for a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He returned for Al Hilal with two brief appearances in October and November but injured a hamstring and has not played since. He said he is targeting the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He can no longer play at the level we are used to," the club's coach, Jorge Jesus, said recently. Things have become difficult for him, unfortunately."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in January, Neymar said he was aiming to play in the 2026 in the US, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know this will be my last World Cup, my last shot, my last chance and I will do everything I can to play in it," he told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  A return to Brazil would likely be the last chance for a player who is his country's all-time leading scorer with 79 goals in 127 matches. (AFP)

<img alt="The ongoing drama between the Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler may be coming to a head. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789402_1_20250128071232.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat indefinitely suspended Jimmy Butler after the disgruntled forward walked out of a practice session, reportedly when he was told he would be coming off the bench for the NBA team.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Miami Heat are suspending Jimmy Butler without pay effective immediately for an indefinite period to last no fewer than five games," the Heat said in a statement posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspension is due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services," it read. "This includes walking out of practice earlier today."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the third time this month the Heat have suspended the 35-year-old Butler, who had been expected back on Monday from a two-game ban for missing a team flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had previously been suspended for seven games for "multiple instances of conduct detrimental to the team".
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, in his 15th NBA campaign, sparked the Heat into the 2020 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers, and the 2023 finals, where they lost to Denver.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even before his first suspension, Butler had indicated he wanted a trade. Initially resistant, the Heat have said the would "listen to offers" from other teams for the six-time All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minimum five-game suspension announced on Monday would run through the NBA's mid-season trade deadline on February 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Miami Herald reported that the Heat would determine whether the suspension would continue after that if Butler remains on their roster after the deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's star guard Tyler Herro said the team is getting used to playing amid the uncertainty surrounding Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It kind of feels normal now at this point," Herro said in comments reported by the Herald. "It's kind of just what it is. Nothing is guaranteed, so we just got to be ready to roll with whatever cards we're dealt with tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  Just past the halfway point in the regular season, the Heat are eighth in the Eastern Conference with their playoff chances in the balance. (AFP)

    Spain coach De la Fuente extends contract
   </title>

<img alt="De La Fuente's contract will run until 2028. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789401_1_20250128071112.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Euro 2024 winning coach Luis de la Fuente has extended his contract until 2028, the Spanish football federation said in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 63-year-old has been in the post since 2022, guiding Spain to the Nations League title in 2023 and then to victory against England in last year's Euro final.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract extension includes the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and Euro 2028 in Britain and Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the most self-critical and I'm not afraid to take the plunge if I'm convinced of something," De la Fuente told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue on the same path that has brought us here, trying to improve and grow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente previously coached Spain age-group teams, winning both the European under-19 and under-21 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took over the senior side from Luis Enrique following Spain's last-16 exit from the 2022 World Cup against Morocco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was convinced of where I wanted to be. I'm at home, with the RFEF, and very happy. We never thought of another option," De la Fuente said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank the RFEF for their effort," he continued. "I feel even happier than I was because I have been so well treated. We work from stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain powered to a record-breaking fourth European Championship title last year, winning all seven of their matches in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  La Roja will start their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign later this year, after the completion of the Nations League. In that competition, they face Netherlands in the quarter-finals in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain will be one of the favourites for the 2026 World Cup, boasting a young squad including teenage star Lamine Yamal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I let myself be carried away by euphoria I could promise many things," said De la Fuente. "But I only promise enthusiasm, effort and work to achieve our goals. Give everything to achieve something. We have a lot of football potential, but so do our rivals."
  <br>
  <br>
  If De la Fuente sees out his extended contract, he will become Spain's longest-serving coach since Vicente del Bosque spent eight years in charge, during which they won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. (AFP)

    Fuji Media bosses resign over sexual assault scandal

<img alt="Fuji Media has promised an independent investigation by a third-party committee, which will be made up of three lawyers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789378_1_20250128012750.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Fuji Media said on Monday its chairman and the head of its TV unit would step down immediately amidst a probe into alleged sexual misconduct by a celebrity TV host.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scandal, which has led to an exodus of advertisers and investor calls for a management shake-up, has also raised concerns about the exploitation of women in Japan's entertainment industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, Japanese magazines accused Masahiro Nakai, a TV host and leader of the former boy band SMAP, of sexual misconduct. While Nakai has worked for many of Japan's TV networks, the dinner at which the incident occurred was reportedly arranged by one of the broadcaster's executives.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the magazines, Shukan Bunshun, has also reported the same executive had in a separate event gathered female TV personalities at a hotel to act as entertainment for Nakai and other celebrities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nakai, 52, has apologised for causing "trouble" and announced his retirement from show business. He acknowledged reaching a settlement with another party but has not addressed the allegations directly. Nakai did not respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media said Chairman Shuji Kanoh and the head of its TV unit Koichi Minato would step down effective Monday. Another TV executive, Kenji Shimizu, will lead the TV unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to tabloid magazines Josei Seven and Shukan Bunshun, a woman was invited to a dinner in June 2023 with a Fuji TV executive that Nakai also attended. But the executive backed out at the last minute leaving her alone with Nakai and there was a sexual act against her will, they reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First of all, as a person, I would like to offer my sincere apologies to the woman involved to whom we were unable to show adequate care and awareness of human rights," Kanoh told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Fuji Media spokesperson said the company became aware of the woman's complaint that June but did not widely investigate it or report it due to privacy concerns and settlement talks between the parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said on Monday that it had questioned an employee multiple times about the dinner and that the employee had denied knowing about or arranging the dinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outrage over the scandal grew after a January 17 news conference by Minato that was closed to most of the press with Minato answering few questions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of big-name firms including Toyota and cosmetics giant Kao have suspended advertising with Fuji and most of its ads are currently public service announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fuji Media has promised an independent investigation by a third-party committee. It will be made up of three lawyers and is scheduled to submit a report by the end of March. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December 18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in US chipmakers.
 <br>
  <br>
  AI leader Nvidia sank 17 percent, and about US$590 billion in stock market value, the deepest ever one-day loss for a company on Wall Street, according to LSEG data. It was more than double the previous one-day record loss, set by Nvidia last September.
  <br>
  <br>
  An index of semiconductor stocks dropped 9.2 percent in its biggest single-day percentage fall since March 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese startup DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant that it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, raising questions about investor expectations that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centers.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's AI Assistant by Monday had overtaken US rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's App Store.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said there are still many questions about the DeepSeek model and its impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is a drubbing for these (AI leader) stocks, but I don't necessarily think whatever's going to happen in the short while here - the next couple of days - is where they are ultimately valued," she said. Optimism over AI and gains in Nvidia and other big technology-related shares helped to drive the stock market's sharp gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65 percent, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46  percent, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07 percent, to 19,341.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 registered its biggest one-day percentage fall since January 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other big tech-related companies, Microsoft shares fell 2.1 percent and Google-parent Alphabet dropped 4.2 percent, while AI server maker Dell Technologies declined 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centre operators also tanked, including Digital Realty, which fell 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power companies, which are expected to see higher demand from energy-intensive data centres needed to develop AI technology, also fell. Vistra dropped 28.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks are likely to stay in focus this week, with some big technology names, including Microsoft, due to post-quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are keen to hear from the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to hold its lending rate steady in its first interest-rate decision of the year due on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers also were digesting news that the US and Colombia had pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hang Seng Bank has been fined HK$66.4 million for regulatory failures and overcharging clients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Securities and Futures Commission on Monday said it found significant regulatory breaches on the bank’s sale of collective investment scheme and derivative products between February 2014 and May 2023, during which clients were overcharged and inadequately informed about the financial benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Hang Seng Bank received at least HK$22.4 million in excess fees from these transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SFC concluded that the bank had failed to operate with due care and diligence, ensure adequate disclosure to clients, prevent conflicts of interest, and comply with regulatory requirements necessary to protect client interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank, for its part, said it accepts the investigation findings, adding that it has already compensated the affected clients and taken remedial actions to rectify and strengthen its internal controls.

<img alt="The Official Receiver's Office says it was only notified of the incident a month after it happened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789361_1_20250127205747.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government office responsible for providing insolvency services has issued an apology after magnetic tapes containing information of about 76,000 people went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  However, it stressed chances of a data leak is "extremely low".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Official Receiver's Office revealed on Monday that seven magnetic backup tapes were lost while being delivered from Immigration Tower to Queensway Government Offices on December 23 last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the office only received a report about the incident last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] expresses sincere apologies for the loss and for the delay in reporting the incident," a spokesperson for the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tapes were stored in a locked protective case and information on them had been encrypted by a system "used extensively in government and military applications", according to the office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [Official Receiver's Office] considers that the risk of leakage of personal data from the tapes is extremely low. Based on the current investigation, there is no evidence that the data contained on the tapes has been read or compromised," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tapes contained personal data of about 76,000 individuals, including creditors of insolvency cases and serving staff of the [Official Receiver's Office]."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office said it has made changes to existing procedures and is conducting a thorough investigation, including on the delay in reporting the incident to senior management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken, the office added.

 President Xi Jinping on Monday said the country has made solid progress in advancing Chinese modernisation amid "complex and challenging" situations over the past twelve months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a high-level reception ahead of the Lunar New Year, the President touched on the country’s achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Year of the Dragon, we demonstrated vitality and a can-do spirit. We endured storms and saw the rainbow," Xi said at the reception held by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with complex and challenging situations, China responded with composure and implemented a range of comprehensive measures, overcame difficulties and forged ahead with determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the President expressed confidence that the country will continue to forge ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will undoubtedly break new ground in reform and development as long as we strengthen our conviction and confidence, confront problems and obstacles directly, and tackle risks and challenges without hesitation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firm DeepSeek's artificial intelligence chatbot has soared to the top of the Apple Store's download charts, stunning industry insiders and analysts with its ability to match its US competitors at a lower cost.
 <br>
  <br>
  The programme has shaken up the tech industry and hit US titans including Nvidia and Meta, which has spent vast sums of cash to get ahead in the fast-developing AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasdaq futures slumped and technology shares slid in Japan on Monday as surging popularity of DeepSeek's product wobbled investors' faith in the profitability of AI and the sector's voracious demand for high-tech chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, seemingly challenging a widespread bet in financial markets that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a case of a crowded trade, and now DeepSeek is giving a reason for investors and traders to unwind," said Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than eight percent, on course for its biggest one-day fall since September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week it announced a US$19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-centre joint venture with OpenAI. (Agencies)

    Exchange Fund investment income drops in 2024

<img alt="Eddie Yue, HKMA chief executive, says the global investment outlook remains challenging in 2025. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789327_1_20250127181821.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said income from the exchange fund fell by 3.1 percent in 2024 to HK$219 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the whole year, income from bond investments dropped 6.3 percent year-on-year to HK$135.6 billion, while income from non-local equity investments declined 6.7 percent to HK$68.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign exchange valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets also fell by HK$35.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, income from local equity investments gained HK$21.8 billion, while returns on other investments stood at HK$28.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the fund used to defend the Hong Kong dollar saw a HK$226 billion gain, its best ever result.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the fourth-quarter loss last year was due to increased volatility in the global markets following geopolitical risks, as well as increasing concerns over inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strong US dollar also weighed on other major currencies during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said further challenges lie ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new US administration's policies on the economy, tax and trade could add uncertainties to the inflation path, and that, in turn, affects how much room the Fed has for adjusting monetary policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[And] any escalation in trade frictions among major economies or geopolitical situation could impact real economic activities, and may also trigger volatility in the financial markets."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property developer China Vanke on Monday said its chairman Yu Liang and CEO Zhu Jiusheng had resigned, amid concerns over the company's liquidity as it faces several debt maturity deadlines this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vanke warned Monday that it incurred major losses in 2024, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanke said it expected a net loss of approximately 45 billion yuan (US$6.2 billion) in 2024, citing reasons including "the continuous market downturn" and "sales and gross profit margins (that) turned out to be lower than investment expectations". (Agencies)

    Congolese rebels say they've captured city of Goma

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rwanda-backed rebels claimed they captured eastern Congo’s largest city of Goma early on Monday, as the United Nations described a mass panic among its two million people and Congo’s government said the rebel advance was a “declaration of war."
 <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels announced the city's capture in a statement minutes before a 48-hour deadline expired that had been imposed by the group for the Congolese army to surrender their weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Monday morning, gunfire was heard throughout the city, according to two aid workers sheltering there who were not authorised to speak to the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the rebels urged residents of Goma to remain calm and for members of the Congolese military to assemble at the central stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The M23 rebels’ offensive in the heart of the mineral-rich region threatens to dramatically worsen one of Africa’s longest wars and further displace civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a United Nations report, over a third of the population of North Kivu province where Goma is located are currently displaced and the capture of Goma will likely exacerbate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Sunday night, UN peacekeepers began to process members of the military who had begun to surrender on the outskirts of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya made a statement in a video posted on X calling for the protection of civilians and saying the country is “in a war situation where the news is changing.”
  <br>
  <br>
  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the Rwanda-backed offensive "must stop", expressing his country's solidarity with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
  <br>
  <br>
  With international pressure mounting for an end to the battle for Goma, Kenya announced on Sunday that Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame had agreed to attend a summit in the next two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  M23 fighters and 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers had been laying siege to Goma for several days, according to the United Nations and security sources. (Agencies)

 The world marked 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Monday, with some of the few remaining survivors attending ceremonies at the site of the Nazi death camp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was the largest of the extermination camps and has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews, one million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945, along with more than 100,000 non-Jews.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, Polish President Andrzej Duda laid flowers at the site alongside survivors, some wearing scarves in the blue-and-white stripes of their death camp uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 50 survivors were expected at the main commemoration outside the gates of Auschwitz II-Birkenau alongside dozens of world leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we will focus on the survivors and their message," Auschwitz Museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be any speeches by politicians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Survivors around the world spoke about the need to preserve the memory of what happened when there will no longer be living witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also warned about rising hatred and anti-Semitism around the world and spoke of their fears about history repeating itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said it could be the last major anniversary with such a large group of survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all know that in 10 years it will not be possible to have a large group for the 90th anniversary," Sawicki said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Auschwitz was created in 1940 using barracks in Oswiecim, southern Poland. Its name was Germanised into Auschwitz by the Nazis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first 728 Polish political prisoners arrived on June 14 of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 17, 1945, as Soviet troops advanced, the SS forced 60,000 emaciated prisoners to walk west in what became known as the "Death March".
  <br>
  <br>
  From January 21-26, the Germans blew up the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria and withdrew as Soviet troops approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 27, Soviet troops arrived, finding 7,000 survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day of its liberation has been designated by the United Nations as Holocaust Remembrance Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Until the conflict with Ukraine in 2022, a Russian delegation had always attended the annual liberation ceremony but Moscow will be barred again this year. (AFP)

    Palestinians begin returning to northern Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Masses of displaced Palestinians began streaming towards the north of the war-battered Gaza Strip on Monday after Israel and Hamas said they had reached a deal for the release of another six hostages.
 <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough preserves a fragile ceasefire and paves the way for more hostage-prisoner swaps under an agreement aimed at ending the more than 15-month conflict, which has devastated the Gaza Strip and displaced nearly all its residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel had been preventing Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the truce, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late on Sunday they would be allowed to pass after the new deal was reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds began making their way north along a coastal road on foot Monday morning, carrying what belongings they could.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling when you go back home, back to your family, relatives and loved ones, and inspect your house -- if it is still a house," displaced Gazan Ibrahim Abu Hassera told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas called the return "a victory" for Palestinians that "signals the failure and defeat of the plans for occupation and displacement".
  <br>
  <br>
  Its ally Islamic Jihad, meanwhile, called it a "response to all those who dream of displacing our people".
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came after US President Donald Trump floated an idea to "clean out" Gaza and resettle Palestinians in Jordan and Egypt, drawing condemnation from regional leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Mahmud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a "strong rejection and condemnation of any projects" aimed at displacing Palestinians from Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any attempt to move them from Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We say to Trump and the whole world: we will not leave Palestine or Gaza, no matter what happens," said displaced Gaza resident Rashad al-Naji.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had floated the idea to reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One: "You're talking about probably a million and half people, and we just clean out that whole thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Moving Gaza's roughly 2.4 million inhabitants could be done "temporarily or could be long term", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- who opposed the truce deal and has voiced support for re-establishing Israeli settlements in Gaza -- called Trump's suggestion of "a great idea".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arab League rejected the idea, warning against "attempts to uproot the Palestinian people from their land", saying their forced displacement could "only be called ethnic cleansing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said "our rejection of the displacement of Palestinians is firm and will not change. Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians."
  <br>
  <br>
  Egypt's foreign ministry said it rejected any infringement of Palestinians' "inalienable rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce has brought a surge of food, fuel, medicines and other aid into rubble-strewn Gaza, but the UN says "the humanitarian situation remains dire".
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, 87 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 47,306 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    'HK border checkpoints ready for LNY tourists'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Director of Immigration on Monday said he is confident that Hong Kong’s border checkpoints have enough capacity to handle an influx of tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border crossings won’t operate beyond the usual hours during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a year-end press conference, Benson Kwok said he expects 7.3 million land border crossings during the eight-day holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our border capacity is enough to handle the large crowds of tourists. But of course we hope the travellers will arrive or depart Hong Kong out of the peak periods, so that they don’t waste too much time at the control points,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also said there were a total of 298 million inbound and outbound trips last year, 40 percent up from 2023 and close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  On 10 Hongkongers held prisoner in Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, Kwok said the department will continue to assist security officials in trying to get them released.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are quite a lot of challenges but the Immigration Department is supporting the special team to provide assistance to the assistance seekers,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We sincerely hope that our special team can help them to come back to Hong Kong in the very very near future, and even to enjoy Chinese New Year with their family members.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Kwok said children aged seven or above with an SAR passport and permanent Hong Kong identity card will soon be able to use e-channels at control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The immigration chief said he expects around 200,000 children will benefit from the new measure.

    Public lack knowledge of space oil drug: survey

<img alt="TWGH CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin, left, said a lack of understanding would cause more people to use the drug.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey by a drug counselling centre under the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals found that 30 percent of respondents were unaware of the harmful effects of the "space oil drug."
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre polled around 1,600 citizens aged between 15 and 56 from September to December last year. About half of them were under the age of 15, and almost 80 percent of them were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that more than 70 percent of those surveyed mistakenly believed nicotine and synthetic cannabinoids were the main ingredient of the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hospital group's CROSS Centre’s clinical psychologist Christopher Sin on Monday said a lack of understanding would lead to more young people using the drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If their perception of space oil is [that] the ingredients are nicotine or cannabinoids, then they will easily be in contact with this kind of harmful substance under peer influence or via internet advertisements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Speaking of the long term, if they don't have a [good] understanding of the ingredients, this will increase the chances of [them] depending on this substance to manage their life hassles or other life issues," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sin pointed out that respondents might also want to try the drug out of curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the centre said more than 10 percent of its current 526 substance abuse cases had taken the space oil drug. Among them, 55 percent were minors, with the youngest being 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity called for more promotion of the harmful effects through various social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged parents and schools to take action if they think youngsters have been taking the substance while being aware of some of the tell-tale side effects, such as losing control of one's emotions, loss of balance and convulsive movements.

 As the Year of the Snake approaches, various floats and international performing groups are putting the finishing touches on their preparations for the annual Chinese New Year night parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the parade will kick off at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza, winding its way through Canton, Haiphong and Nathan roads, before reaching the Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s festivities, under the theme "Unfold a Year of Good Fortune", will feature nine floats showcasing unique elements from the SAR, alongside 46 performing groups from around the globe, to highlight the city's reputation as an events capital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The first report on last month’s Jeju Air crash in South Korea confirmed bird strikes in the plane's engines, though officials haven't determined the cause of the accident that killed all but two of the 181 people on board .
 <br>
  <br>
  The preliminary accident report released on Monday said feathers and bird blood stains were found in both engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal Teals,” the report said, referring to a migratory duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said the plane's black box stopped recording about four minutes before the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea earlier announced it would remove a concrete structure at the end of the airport's runway that was involved in the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some experts have said that Muan International Airport’s localiser — a set of antennas in a concrete structure that guide aircraft during landings — likely made the crash of the Jeju Air plane worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 skidded off the airport’s runaway on December 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into the concrete structure and bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many observers said the structure should have been made with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials closed the Cheung Sha Wan Lunar New Year fair for several hours on Monday after some stalls were damaged by strong winds overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goods were left scattered on the ground and scaffolding was damaged, with a similar scene at a fair in Tsz Wan Shan.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman selling orchids at Cheung Sha Wan told RTHK she thinks she has lost tens of thousands of dollars due to the damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the entire year, the two days before the Lunar New Year is the most important for business. This is really miserable for farmers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan inspected the scene in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair reopened at around 3pm after damaged scaffolding was removed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a new season of the series "The Nitty Gritty of Law" with the Law Society next month to explore different legal issues with experts in the field.
 <br>
  <br>
  RTHK assistant director Vincent Lee told a launch ceremony on Monday that the inaugural season of the programme, which was solely in audio form, had been well-received.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the coming season will also be aired on television and online platforms, while introducing a radio drama to promote legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roden Tong, the president of the Law Society, said he hopes audiences can learn more about the law through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The programme, which has 16 episodes, will be aired on Sundays with the first episode launching on February 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The episodes will first be aired from 12.15pm to 1pm on RTHK Radio 1, before being broadcast on RTHK TV 31 on 7pm. They are also available on RTHK's website and mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legal experts, such as former secretary for justice Elsie Leung and a number of ex-Law Society heads, will be invited to the show to discuss various legal topics, such as family law, criminal law, and intellectual property.

 Monday marks the 28th day of the 12th lunar month.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Chinese tradition, it is a day designated for "spring cleaning", when families deep-clean their homes in the run up to the Lunar New Year and put up new "fai chuns" -- red banners bearing auspicious phrases.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market is flooded with mass produced, digitally-printed "fai chuns", many people still prefer the more traditional, handwritten ones that are becoming quite rare these days.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK visited an elderly calligraphy master in North Point, and asked him why it's so important to preserve this traditional craft.

<img alt="Rosanna Law says the government hopes to review the positioning of performance venues by the end of this year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789282_1_20250127121148.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said the government would conduct a strategic review of the use of the city's performance venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Law expected this would be completed by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Ta Kung Pao published on Monday, Law said Hong Kong would have more venues to stage more kinds of performances and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include the Kai Tak Sports Park, and the WestK Performing Arts Centre that is set to be completed next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Airport Authority also recently announced that it would build the second phase of the AsiaWorld-Expo to expand the total exhibition space to 100,000 square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is set for completion in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This venue has a favourable location, [it’s] near the airport, and [it’s also] convenient for Zhuhai and Macau travellers to head to. I have high hopes [for the venue],” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With more venues, she said the SAR would be able to stage more events.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If there is a better allocation, world-class venues can carry out more world-class performances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In another interview with Wen Wei Po, the minister stressed the city has to focus on both quality and quantity for tourism development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said on Sunday that Colombia had backed down and agreed to accept repatriated citizens on military flights, after US President Donald Trump threatened major sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afterwards, Colombia said it had "overcome the impasse" with Washington in the row over the reception of migrants deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue receiving Colombians who return as deportees," Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said at a news conference after Bogota blocked the entry of US planes carrying deported Colombians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had threatened sanctions of 25 percent that would quickly scale up to 50 percent against Latin America's fourth largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia has agreed to "unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on US military aircraft, without limitation or delay," a White House statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's events make clear to the world that America is respected again," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump will continue to fiercely protect our nation's sovereignty, and he expects all other nations of the world to fully cooperate in accepting the deportation of their citizens illegally present in the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a leftist, had infuriated Trump by refusing to accept military planes of Colombians deported from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had earlier said he would take back migrants but "with dignity," including on civilian planes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kaylin Hsieh has become the third Hong Kong fencer in history to win a Grand Prix, after defeating world number six Nelli Differt in the women's epée final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, 23, beat the Estonian 15-7 on Monday for her first victory against the 34-year-old in six attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR fencer joins Olympic gold medallists Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong in winning a Grand Prix for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh wrote on social media that she started the competition with a cold and struggled to find rhythm, but decided to try to fight through it to see how far she could go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes life throws challenges at you when you least expect it and you just have to find a way to push through," she wrote, calling her triumph an unforgettable moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This gold medal is not just a milestone for me. It's a reminder of the power of resilience and mindset."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh, currently ranked 28th in the world, last topped a podium in international competition in the under-17 World Championships in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  She snatched a bronze at the World Cup in Vancouver last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsieh represented the SAR in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was an individual and team champion representing the University of Notre Dame in the US during the 2022 NCAA fencing tournament.

    China's factory output falls in January

<img alt="Workers producing photovoltaic modules for solar panels in a factory in Suqian, Jiangsu province. China's PMI dipped below the 50-mark in January, indicating contraction in manufacturing activity. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789279_1_20250127115151.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data on Monday showed that China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for its domestic manufacturing sector came in at 49.1 in January, down from 50.1 in December.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for China's non-manufacturing sector, which includes services and construction, was also lower in January coming in at 50.2, down from 52.2 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the combined profit of major industrial enterprises went up 11 percent year on year in December 2024, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI data in January was influenced by factors such as the approaching Chinese New Year holiday and enterprise employees' returning home for festival reunions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy hit the government's growth target of around five percent over 2024, but exports and industrial output far outpaced retail sales and unemployment remained elevated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports on February 1 also adds to the lingering uncertainty surrounding the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus reached almost US$1 trillion last year, as producers looked to shift stocks overseas to counter weak domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's outbound shipments were further assisted by factory gate deflation and a weak yuan, making Chinese goods more competitive in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Back at home, falling prices affected corporate profits and workers' incomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers have promised to roll out further stimulus over 2025, in addition to the ones already implemented last year, as Beijing prioritises revitalising domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting mainland consumers spending again would reduce producers' exposure to Trump's tariff threats, which he said could be as high as 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  State leaders are also hoping last year's policy support measures will increase demand in the struggling property sector and ease developers' financial difficulties, which affects domestic demand and local government finances. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority (HA) dietician told people to avoid festive fat traps and overeating during the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Registered dietitian Ivy Chua from the HA said people can order healthier dishes when they are having their reunion dinner at restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you really want to eat out, try to control the portion and the food choices you are having. For example, you can choose some better quality protein, something like  steamed fish is a really lower fat protein source,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can get rid of chicken skin, and avoid eating sauces to have a healthier diet, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua also said people could select high-fibre food, like vegetables, so as to eat less meat.

  <br>
  To avoid overeating before the main reunion dinner, Chua said people could have high-fibre snacks before the big meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also reminded citizens, especially diabetes patients and people who have high blood pressure and high blood lipids, not to have too many Chinese New Year cakes and deep-fried traditional snacks as they contain a lot of oil, salt and sugar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a lot of food that is really high in calories, especially in fat and sugar. I'd recommend everyone to try limit their portion of the food, especially the traditional snacks, and actually they can find some healthier snacks to replace it,” Chua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chua suggested that people can make healthier snacks at home such as rice crackers, low calorie jelly with fruits, or plain popcorn with a little bit salt.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley rushed in three touchdowns each as the Philadelphia Eagles reached the Super Bowl with a 55-23 win over the Washington Commanders in the NFC Championship game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles' powerful running game proved too much for the Commanders as Philadelphia reached the NFL's championship showpiece for the second time in three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia's 55 points, with seven rushing touchdowns, was the highest total scored in a conference championship game, beating the previous best of 51 points set by the Buffalo Bills in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs will face the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl in New Orleans on February 9 - in a rematch of the 2023 Super Bowl, which they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's Jayden Daniels was looking to become the first rookie quarterback to reach the Super Bowl, but while he was his composed self again, the Commanders defense was no match for Philadelphia's awesome power on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Zane Gonzalez opened the scoring with a field goal for the Commanders, Barkley displayed his incredible power and speed once again as he sprinted home for a 60-yard score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley then put the Eagles 14-3 up late in the first quarter bursting into the end-zone from four yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders got themselves back into the game when another Gonzalez field goal was followed up by Daniels connecting with Terry McLaurin on a 36-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the final minutes of the opening half were a mess for the Commanders. On fourth-and-5 from near midfield, Eagles receiver A.J. Brown was able to get behind cornerback Marshon Lattimore for a crucial 31-yard completion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, Lattimore got called for pass interference in the end zone after a third-down incompletion, which left Hurts with just a yard to rush in for a score.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disastrous turnover followed when Jeremy McNichols was stripped off the ball on the kickoff return, allowing the Eagles to have the ball again. Hurts made the most of it - finding Brown with a 4-yard pass as Philadelphia opened up a 15-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gonzalez's field goal reduced the gap before the interval but the Eagles were in no mood to open the door to their divisional rivals with Hurts showing his prowess with his feet as he ran in from 9-yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniels then showed his rushing ability, wrongfooting the Eagles defense with a sharp change of direction for a 10-yard score and then he provided a succesful two point conversion to reduce the deficit to 11 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hurts started the fourth quarter with a quarterback sneak getting him over the line for his fourth overall touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  After another Barkley touchdown, rookie running back Will Shipley joined the party, with a 2-yard rush in the final minutes. (AFP)

<img alt="Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy and his wife Tracy Dixon look dejected after their side's loss, while Leicester City chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha celebrates. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789240_1_20250127053623.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leicester pushed Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou closer to the exit door with a 2-1 win that extended Spurs' dismal run, while Manchester United's 1-0 victory at Fulham eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham blew the lead on home turf as they crumbled to a sixth defeat in their last seven league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  With only one win in their last 11 top-flight matches, Postecoglou's side are languishing in 15th place, just eight points above the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another woeful result for the beleaguered Australian, who has faced mounting calls for his dismissal throughout a turbulent second season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are dangerously close to being sucked into the relegation battle but Postecoglou believes his injury-ravaged squad are still fighting for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you are the manager of a football club, you can be very vulnerable and isolated. I don't feel that," said Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like this group of players, not for me, are giving everything for the club. I have a group of staff that is really committed. I focus on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Richarlison had headed the home side in front but two goals in four minutes at the start of the second half from Jamie Vardy and Bilal El Khannouss ended Leicester's seven-game losing streak in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Postecoglou fights to save his job, Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy can breathe a little easier over his own future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester are now one place and one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive win," said Van Nistelrooy. "The players are buying into it. I can only be very proud of this team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Any notion United could be dragged into a relegation battle now appears gone after Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike ground out a much-needed victory at Fulham for the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chances were at a premium for both sides until the Argentinian's effort flicked off Sasa Lukic to loop over Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joachim Andersen had a header cleared off the line by Toby Collyer as the visitors held out for a victory which lifts United up to 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League qualification for a second consecutive season were dented as an under-strength West Ham battled back to earn a 1-1 draw in Birmingham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Ramsey's strike was just reward for a fast start by Unai Emery's side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Graham Potter was forced to name four full-backs in his starting line-up for the injury-hit Hammers, who were without captain Jarrod Bowen.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the visitors rallied in the second half and were unfortunate not to take all three points after Emerson Palmieri's header levelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Paqueta thought he had won the game in stoppage time, but Tomas Soucek had strayed offside before teeing up the Brazilian to quell Potter's jubilant celebration on the touchline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa remain in eighth, four points off the top four, while West Ham sit 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford benefited from penalty controversy to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Frank's team earned a 66th minute spot-kick when Maxence Lacroix fouled Nathan Collins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo's spot-kick hit the post, but Palace's reprieve was short-lived as VAR ruled Marc Guehi had encroached before the shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brentford forward gratefully accepted his second chance by sending Palace keeper Dean Henderson the wrong way for his 14th goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade netted in the 80th minute for Brentford before Palace winger Romain Esse came off the bench to score with his first touch on his debut five minutes later. (AFP)

    Trump vows tariffs, sanctions on Colombia over flights

<img alt="US President Donald Trump (Left) and Colombian President Gustavo Petro are at loggerheads over mass deportations of migrants by Washington. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789231_1_20250127031851.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump vowed on Sunday to hit Colombia with steep tariffs and other sanctions after his counterpart Gustavo Petro blocked deportation flights from the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Petro's denial of these flights has jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States, so I have directed my Administration to immediately take the following urgent and decisive retaliatory measures," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He listed "25 percent tariffs," a travel ban on Colombian government officials, and invoking sanctions under emergency presidential powers -- among several other severe responses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia's refusal to accept the flights is the second case of a Latin American nation refusing US military deportation flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals," Petro wrote, noting that there were 15,660 Americans without proper immigration status in Colombia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petro's comments add to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as Trump's week-old administration starts mobilising for mass deportations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's foreign ministry late on Saturday condemned "degrading treatment" of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight. Upon arrival, some of the passengers also reported mistreatment during the flight, according to local news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane, which was carrying 88 Brazilian passengers, 16 US security agents, and eight crew members, had been originally scheduled to arrive in Belo Horizonte in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.
  <br>
  <br>
  There, Brazilian officials ordered the removal of the handcuffs, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commercial charter flight was the second this year from the US carrying undocumented migrants deported back to Brazil and the first since Trump's inauguration, according to Brazil's federal police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The use of US military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the past, US military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  This has been the first time in recent memory that US military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one American official said. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli army fire killed 22 people in south Lebanon on Sunday including a soldier, health officials said, as residents tried to return home on the day Israel was meant to withdraw under a truce deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The withdrawal deadline is part of a ceasefire agreement reached two months ago that ended Israel's war with Iran-backed Hezbollah, which had left the Lebanese militant group weakened.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal that took effect on November 27 said the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside United Nations peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew over a 60-day period that ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parties have traded blame for the delay in implementing the agreement, and on Friday Israel said it would keep troops across the border in south Lebanon beyond the pullout date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry said on Sunday that Israeli forces opened fire on "citizens who were trying to return to their villages that are still under (Israeli) occupation".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said in a statement that its "troops operating in southern Lebanon fired warning shots to remove threats" where "suspects were identified approaching the troops".
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint statement from the UN special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the head of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission acknowledged that "as seen tragically this morning, conditions are not yet in place for the safe return of citizens to their villages". (AFP)

    Yoon Suk-yeol indicted on insurrection charges

<img alt="President Yoon is accused of being a 'ringleader of insurrection' over the short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789208_1_20250126184414.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's prosecutors indicted President Yoon Su-yeol on Sunday on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3, the main opposition party said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk-yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection," Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference. "The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The indictment was also reported by South Korean media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties over the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers had urged the prosecutors to immediately release the him from what they call illegal custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under criminal investigation, he has been in custody since becoming the first sitting president to be arrested on January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and his lawyers argued at a Constitutional Court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break political deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  In parallel with his criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers, with 180 days to decide.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on December 14, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon rescinded his martial law after about six hours after lawmakers from the main opposition party, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers equipped with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment, were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows during the dramatic confrontation. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Jordan and Egypt should take more Palestinians from Gaza, where Israel's war against Hamas has caused a humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I said to him I’d love you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess. I’d like him to take people," Trump said about his call on Saturday with Jordan's King Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’d like Egypt to take people," Trump told reporters, adding he would speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after the October 7 attack by the Hamas, when militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, Israel's campaign has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have also died in Gaza combat. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's public hospitals are ready to handle an expected rise in flu cases during the Lunar New Year, Hospital Authority (HA) chief executive Tony Ko said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Ko said the authority has taken steps to prepare for the peak flu season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arranged additional manpower and asked colleagues to avoid taking many leaves during that period. We have also increased the number of hospital beds, so we are confident in our ability to handle an uptick in service demand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ko, who will step down in July after serving for almost six years, said it is an appropriate time to leave and that he has no regrets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have successfully overcome many challenges like the Covid pandemic. Looking at the Hospital Authority now, we've recovered our services, improved our systems, and built better cooperation with the mainland and other countries... I can see many things are on track. It's the right time to leave," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the HA will continue to automate and streamline certain work processes so that clinical staff can spend more time with patients and better serve them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers braved the chilly conditions to explore the 1.1-kilometre section of the East Coast boardwalk from Fortress Hill to North Point, which opened on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  North Point resident Adrienne Garvey told RTHK that her family is looking forward to using the promenade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The kids play area here is fantastic… the kids are loving and exploring it, and I am looking forward to running along here, all the way down to Kennedy Town [in future]. I can have a nice long running route to train on," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we'll be here every week, if it's the kids with their scooters and running and playing in the park, I think this is a really nice place. It is under the shade as well, so in the summer it will be so good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her son Max also said he loves the play area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The waterfront looks quite nice, and I think it's very fun because it has a playground. Also we like running down the bumps. It's the first day we are here, so we are just going to maybe go and see the whole bridge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another resident, surnamed Kwok, said the trail is perfect for running.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I often run, and it is impossible to run along the harbour before. So I came this morning to take a look to prepare for future runs… It is very comfortable and faces the sea," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pet owner Carina Chan also told RTHK that the boardwalk is great for walking her dog.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We go to East Coast Park every day via Java Road. We had to cross the road each time, but now with the boardwalk... it is more convenient and safe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The harbourfront walkway - built under the Island Eastern Corridor - spans 2.2 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its eastern section, which will connect North Point to Quarry Bay, is set to open in phases in the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway is part of a bigger, 13-kilometre harbourfront promenade project that will eventually connect Kennedy Town with Shau Kei Wan.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has vowed to beef up efforts in promoting Hong Kong to the rest of the world, saying some of those attending the World Economic Forum in Davos have signalled their intention to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said on Sunday that he has invited delegations to explore the "tremendous opportunities" offered by Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area as well as the mainland, during the high-level conference in Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some fintech companies in Europe said they are planning to set up shop in Hong Kong, and use the city as a base for expanding business in Asia," he wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, we will continue to step up our efforts to promote Hong Kong, so that more friends can learn about, make good use of, and contribute to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the SAR can help connect the mainland with developed economies and emerging markets in the Global South in areas like technology and green finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also pointed out that the economic situation in China and the United States, as well as Sino-US ties, were topics of concern among those attending the Davos forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang had cited facts and data in explaining China's economy to let foreign investors have a more comprehensive understanding of the country's development while strengthening their confidence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday said the government will set up three more community living rooms this year to improve the quality of life for underprivileged families.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Lee said two projects -- in Shau Kei Wan and Kowloon City -- have already received funding from the Community Care Fund and are expected to begin operations by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said some grassroots families told him that community living rooms have become another home for them, with shared facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms; and offering services like homework assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lee said the first batch of light public housing units in Yuen Long -- providing 2,150 units -- will be ready for move in, in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the second phase of the project will be open for applications soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The administration is committed to fixing housing problems for grassroots families. We are taking concrete action to help these families find a place to live and feel secure," he wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment promotion agency on Sunday said her office will focus on bringing in non-local companies that can "create a larger financial impact" in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the past year, InvestHK helped a record 539 non-local companies establish or expand in the SAR, with total investment reaching HK$67.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The companies we want to attract are from all industries... We want to put more focus on companies that would create more jobs, and to bring in more direct investments, and create a larger financial impact for Hong Kong," its director-general, Alpha Lau, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of these [companies] that we brought in... they are looking at the growth of the demographics and the wealth in the region, so they would want to invest more here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said her department would boost promotional efforts in regions like Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director-general added that she would act as a “salesperson” and clarify any misunderstandings that foreign firms might have about the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The concerns that some of them might have, whether because of geopolitics or other reasons -- they might be due to a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about Hong Kong. I think facts tell a thousand words," Lau said.

    Flu outbreak to worsen after LNY break: paediatrician

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong (HKU) paediatrician on Sunday called on people to stay on the alert, saying the current influenza outbreak may worsen after the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Mike Kwan from HKU’s Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season is expected to peak next month, and people should get vaccinated as soon as possible, if they haven’t already done so.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Temperatures will drop during the upcoming Lunar New Year [holiday], and there will be more social contact through New Year visits and gatherings," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some residents will also travel abroad, but they should be aware that many countries across Asia, including Japan and Korea, are currently experiencing flu outbreaks, so everyone needs to be careful."
  <br>
  <br>
  Three severe flu cases involving children were reported last week, with two of them unvaccinated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said kids who’ve received the flu jab typically show milder symptoms, and require only one to two days of hospitalisation in more serious cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert also urged members of the public to use reliable test kits and maintain good personal hygiene.

<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea has conducted a strategic cruise missile test, state media KCNA reported on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test on Saturday, according to the report which described it as a test-fire of an "important weapon system."

  The strategic cruise missiles traveled 1,500 kilometers and flew between 7,507 and 7,511 seconds before hitting their targets, KCNA reported.

  North Korea's war deterrence means were being "perfected more thoroughly," Kim was quoted as saying, while the leader also vowed to continue efforts to strengthen the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Kim Jong Un affirmed that the DPRK will always make strenuous efforts...to perform its important mission and duty for defending sustainable and lasting peace and stability on the basis of more powerfully developed military muscle in the future."

  The DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
  <br>

  The report said the missile test was part of plans to build national defence capabilities against potential enemies in line with changing regional safety circumstances. (Reuters)

<img alt="Cody Gakpo scores Liverpool's fourth goal against Ipswich. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789155_2_20250126074029.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cody Gakpo struck twice as Premier League leaders Liverpool thrashed Ipswich 4-1 to maintain their six-point lead over Arsenal, who survived Myles Lewis-Skelly's controversial red card to snatch a 1-0 win at Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Troubled champions Manchester City recovered from Abdukodir Khusanov's debut disaster to move into fourth place with a vital 3-1 win against top four rivals Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Anfield, Liverpool cruised to their second successive league victory thanks to a first half goal-spree.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominik Szoboszlai's 11th-minute opener fizzed past Ipswich goalkeeper Christian Walton from Ibrahima Konate's assist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah doubled Liverpool's advantage in the 35th minute with his 23rd goal in all competitions this term.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Egypt forward's 100th Premier League goal at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gakpo killed off Ipswich before half-time when he bundled home after Walton parried Szoboszlai's shot in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch forward netted again in the 66th minute, heading past Walton from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Greaves' stoppage-time diving header was little consolation for third-bottom Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's 16th win from 22 league games this season keeps them on course for a first English title since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think about how can I make sure these players play in a style I would love them to play. And they have done that from the start. It's a joy to watch," Liverpool boss Arne Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quadruple-chasing Reds have a game in hand on second-placed Arsenal, who left it late before keeping the pressure on the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, without ill captain Martin Odegaard, had Lewis-Skelly contentiously sent off for tripping Matt Doherty to stop a Wolves counter-attack in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were furious, protesting that the tackle was too far from goal to warrant a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League Match Centre confirmed on social media that the 18-year-old defender was sent off for "serious foul play".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wolves were also reduced t0 10 men in the 70th minute when Joao Gomes earned a second booking for a foul on Jurrien Timber.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Italy defender Riccardo Calafiori won it for Arsenal in the 74th minute with a half-volley that went in off the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that it was very difficult to accept. I leave it to you guys because it's that obvious. You don't need my words. It was so obvious," Arteta told reporters of Lewis-Skelly's dismissal.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, Uzbekistan defender Khusanov, signed from Lens as part of struggling City's January overhaul, made a woeful start when his miscued header allowed Noni Madueke to give Chelsea a second minute lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City, who also gave a debut to Egypt forward Omar Marmoush after his move from Eintracht Frankfurt, hit back to equalise with Josko Gvardiol's 42nd minute strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland chipped out of position Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez to put City ahead in the 68th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden sprinted clear to score his sixth goal in his last four league games in the 87th minute as Pep Guardiola's side climbed one point above sixth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a much-needed win for City, who suffered a damaging loss at Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and must beat Club Brugge next week to have a chance of reaching the Champions League play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara hit a hat-trick as Bournemouth dented Nottingham Forest's top four charge with a 5-0 demolition at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andoni Iraola's side are undefeated in their last 11 league games and up to seventh place after ending third-placed Forest's own impressive run of eight top-flight matches without losing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Justin Kluivert bagged Bournemouth's opener and Ouattara completed a memorable treble before Antoine Semenyo sealed the Cherries' biggest victory this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak starred as fifth-placed Newcastle won 3-1 at bottom of the table Southampton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jan Bednarek put Southampton ahead but in-form Isak struck twice before Sandro Tonali scored Newcastle's third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton boss David Moyes celebrated becoming the third manager to reach 700 Premier League games with a 1-0 win at Brighton secured by Iliman Ndiaye's 42nd minute penalty. (AFP)

<img alt="USA's Madison Keys celebrates after beating Belarus' Aryna Sabalenka during their women's singles final match on day fourteen of the Australian Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789140_1_20250125213922.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Underdog Madison Keys upset Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in the Australian Open final on Saturday to win her first Grand Slam crown at the age of 29.
 <br>
  <br>
  The American ended world number one Sabalenka's dream of becoming the first woman for 26 years to win a third successive Melbourne Park singles title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys yelled in delight and wiped away tears on securing the title after withstanding a fierce fightback from the Belarusian two-time defending champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, the 2023 and 2024 champion, buried her head in a towel after her 20-match win streak at Melbourne Park was ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 19th-seeded Keys it was the culmination of a 15-year journey from teenage prodigy to major winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have wanted this for so long and I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it did not go my way," said an emotional Keys, whose coach Bjorn Fratangelo is also her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know if I was ever going to get back to this position to try to win a trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm mostly just really proud of myself to get back to this position, to be able to play the way that I played and finish on such a strong note."
  <br>
  <br>
  The American had been tipped as a future world number one after winning her maiden WTA Tour match at the age of 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made her first major semi-final at Melbourne Park 10 years ago as a 19-year-old, but a decade on she can finally call herself a Grand Slam champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made my very first Grand Slam semi-final here in Melbourne," said Keys, the runner-up at the US Open in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to now have won my first Grand Slam in the same place means the absolute world to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My team believed in me every step of the way. So thank you so much," added Keys, who will now equal her career-high seventh in the world ranking she attained nine years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They believed in me when I didn't believe in myself and helped me every step of the way. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didn't know if I was gonna be able to do it again." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian militants and Israel carried out a hostage-prisoner swap on Saturday under a Gaza ceasefire deal, but a last-minute dispute blocked the expected return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to devastated northern Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of the exchange, the second since the truce took effect last Sunday, four freed Israeli women hostages, all soldiers, arrived home in Israel after more than 15 months of captivity in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In exchange, Israel's prison service confirmed that 200 prisoners, whom it called "terrorists", were freed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli captives, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20, and Liri Albag, 19, waved, smiled, and gave thumbs up as they were paraded on a stage in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked and armed militants flanked them during a ceremony watched by hundreds of residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tel Aviv, where a crowd gathered to watch their release on a large TV screen at a plaza known as Hostage Square, there were tears of joy, applause and a loud cheer as Israeli flags waved.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their handover to the Red Cross, Israel's military said the women were transferred back into Israel and "reunited with their parents".
  <br>
  <br>
  Buses carrying the released Palestinians left Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank and Ktziot prison in the Negev desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  As dozens of the former prisoners reached the West Bank city of Ramallah, crowds of Palestinians erupted in joy, raising many of them onto their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas’ political bureau had said on Friday that Palestinians displaced by the war to southern Gaza should have been able to begin returning to the north following Saturday's releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel on Saturday said it would block such returns until civilian woman hostage Arbel Yehud is released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said she "was supposed to be released today" but a Hamas source has said Yehud will be "released as part of the third swap set for next Saturday". (AFP)

<img alt="A government spokesperson says that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789115_1_20250125154721.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday condemned lawmakers in the United States again for proposing a bill to review sanctions against certain SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, calling it an attempt to intimidate those safeguarding national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said in a statement that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty and an inherent right of sovereign states, while accusing US officials of hypocrisy and using double standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the National Security Law has helped restore social stability and improve the business environment after the “black-clad violence” of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, Hong Kong ranks as the world's freest economies among 165 economies. In the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to fifth globally," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, those US politicians insist on turning a blind eye to all these facts, and even clamour for so-called 'sanctions' against the HKSAR personnel who dutifully safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly condemns their political grandstanding rife with ill intentions, which have been seen through by all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson also said that authorities reject any so-called sanctions and vowed to continue its efforts to safeguard national security, and urged US lawmakers to respect international law and stop interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also affirmed that human rights in Hong Kong are constitutionally protected and that law enforcement actions are conducted based on evidence without regard to political beliefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added that the judiciary operates independently, ensuring fair trials and adherence to the rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The judicial system of the HKSAR has always been highly regarded by international communities. Any attempt by any country, organisation, or individual to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power is a reprehensible act undermining the rule of law of the HKSAR," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Making any statement with the intent to interfere with or obstruct the course of justice, or engaging in conduct with the same intent, is very likely to constitute the offence of criminal contempt of court or the offence of perverting the course of justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that the government remains committed to implementing the National Security Law and upholding the principle of "One Country, Two Systems".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday visited residents in Oi Man Estate ahead of the Lunar New Year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee greeted those who came out to see him at the housing estate in Ho Man Tin, and shook hands with members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm also here to have a look at the operation of shops. I bought these turnip cakes. I love them and I will share them with my wife. I heard from the shops that business has been good, meeting their expectations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Lee visited the community living room in Hung Hom, and had a meal with people there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, who pointed out that care teams have an important role to play when it comes to assisting residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive visited the residents with a care team, and learnt about how they provide services to people in the community. We did a year-end clean-up and home repairs for the elderly," Mak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added government officials will continue to visit residents, including elderly people, grassroots families and ethnic minorities, at different districts before the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  An 88-year-old resident said she was happy that she was able to shake hands with the Chief Executive and that people have high expectations of him.

<img alt='Pete Hegseth has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon. File photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789114_1_20250125153744.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate narrowly confirmed former Fox News co-host Pete Hegseth as Pentagon chief on Friday, despite allegations of alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and other fears about his ability to lead the world's most powerful military.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Republican senators voted against Donald Trump's pick as secretary of defense, resulting in a 50-50 tie that required JD Vance to cast the deciding ballot – only the second time in history a vice president has had to intervene to save a cabinet nominee.
  <br>
  <br>
  The razor-edged result underscored concerns about Hegseth, who will take over the Pentagon with war raging in Ukraine, the Middle East volatile despite ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, and as Trump expands the military's role in security on the US-Mexico border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old is a former Army National Guard officer who until recently worked as a co-host for Fox News – one of Trump's favoured television channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has a combative media personality, fierce loyalty and telegenic looks – common hallmarks in Trump's entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters say Hegseth's deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq give him the insight to run the Defense Department better than more experienced officials who would normally be considered for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to focus the military on "lethality" and to bring back "warrior culture" to the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  In confirming him, Republicans brushed aside his lack of experience leading an organisation anywhere near the size of the Defense Department – the country's largest employer with some three million personnel.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also approved Hegseth despite allegations of financial mismanagement at veterans' nonprofits where he previously worked, reports of excessive drinking, and allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked during his confirmation hearing last week about criticism he has faced, Hegseth said there was a "coordinated smear campaign" against him, and that he is "not a perfect person, but redemption is real".
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has stood by him, telling reporters on Friday: "Pete's a very, very good man."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after he was confirmed, Trump wrote on his Social Truth platform: "Congratulations to Pete Hegseth. He will make a great Secretary of Defense!" (AFP)
