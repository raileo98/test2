<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two as Manchester City's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win the 2015 to 2016 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could not have asked for more," said Liverpool manager Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second half was outstanding. There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong," he added. "Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had to settle for a second consecutive league draw, allowing Arsenal the chance to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long balls we won and we could run and in that moment we didn't take the right decisions," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "Maybe that would have been different but at the same time they had chances. Their strikers are really good, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are really dangerous."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night. They were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th. (AFP)

    Mixed day for US stocks as market awaits bank earnings

<img alt="The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787570_1_20250115062828.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed after a choppy session as traders digested better-than-expected inflation data and looked ahead to bank earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future," Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds," said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)

    S. Korea investigators in 'clash' arresting Yoon

<img alt="People gather inside the barricade blocking the road leading to the residence of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787563_1_20250115051133.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators seeking to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol were involved in clashes as they tried to execute a new warrant at his official residence, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Investigators in physical clash as they attempt to forcibly enter presidential residence," the agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as thousands of the embattled leader's die-hard supporters massed outside the presidential residence in the capital Seoul to protect Yoon, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived December 3 imposition of martial law plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators said they would detain anyone who tried to block their bid to execute a new warrant, after they arrived at the presidential residence Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two CIO vehicles have arrived in front of the (presidential) residence," Yonhap News TV reported, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office that is probing Yoon's declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court-ordered warrant is successfully executed, Yoon would become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a first attempt to arrest Yoon on January 3 failed after a tense hours-long standoff with his presidential guards, who refused to budge when investigators tried to execute their warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint team of the CIO and police have since secured a new warrant and massed as many as 1,000 personnel for Wednesday's attempt to detain Yoon, according to local media reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also threatened to detain any guards who obstruct the sitting leader's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Personnel who appeared to be guarding the entrance from outsiders were seen walking from the residence towards its entrance gate early Wednesday, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Yoon were also heard chanting "illegal warrant!" while waving glow sticks and South Korean and American flags. (AFP)

    Fire-hit LA faces new peril as dangerous winds ramp up

<img alt="Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley says teams are in place ready to repel any new fires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787545_1_20250114224256.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hot, powerful winds on Tuesday threatened to rekindle and whip up major fires that have devastated the hills and suburbs of Los Angeles, killing at least 24 people and changing the face of America's second biggest city forever.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after blazes erupted and spread uncontained, forecasters predicted "particularly dangerous" dry Santa Ana winds would spike the wildfire threat for already exhausted firefighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate. Avoid anything that can spark a fire," the National Weather Service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large part of Southern California was under a Red Flag warning, indicating that intense dryness and furious winds would make conditions ripe for wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of Los Angeles County and much of neighbouring Ventura County were in a "Particularly Dangerous Situation," according to the NWS, a designation that was also declared before last week's deadly blazes erupted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials insisted they were poised, with Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley telling reporters a huge firefighting operation was well placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strategically pre-positioned engine strike teams and task forces which are dedicated to rapid response for any new fire that breaks out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed danger comes with 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) of the upmarket Pacific Palisades in ruins and 14,000 acres of the city of Altadena badly charred.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 evacuees are desperate to get back to their homes – or even just to see if anything at all survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My house is gone, I know that. I've seen pictures and all that's left is the chimney. But I need to see it by myself to believe it," said Fred Busche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the desperation, there were stories of fortitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeff Ridgway told how he had refused to abandon the apartment complex he manages, defending it against the fires by hauling buckets of water from the pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was just a war," the 67-year-old said, pointing to a eucalyptus tree he extinguished when it caught fire and threatened the building last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I was just stubborn. I was like: 'I'm not going to be defeated by you. I'm sorry, this is just not gonna happen.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  Search teams using cadaver dogs have been scouring the rubble for days, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna saying he expected more victims would be unearthed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every day we're doing this, we're running across the remains of individual community members," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll continue to find remains."
  <br>
  <br>
  With so many in dire straits, the city was clutching for any sliver of good news.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offered by the Los Angeles Rams, who beat the Minnesota Vikings in an NFL playoff game on Monday night to take them one step closer to the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game, which had been scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, was moved to Arizona to relieve pressure on stretched law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Basketball fans also had a welcomed diversion from the fires when the Lakers played the San Antonio Spurs at home, although they lost 102-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers were among a dozen city sports clubs – also including the Dodgers baseball team – that have pledged US$8 million toward wildfire relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mainstay entertainment industry was also stepping up, with major studios and streamers including Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner and Universal parent company Comcast having all announced eight-figure donations to the recovery effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were also many stories of individual generosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a converted parking lot in Arcadia, 600 people showed up in a single day to distribute donated supplies to evacuees, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many had been redirected from other shelters that also could not accommodate the extra help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very different experience than any other volunteering that I typically do. Because there's really no difference between the people that are helping and the people that are being helped," said 19-year-old student Gianna Karkafi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just, like, luck." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Maro Itoje was selected on Tuesday as England's captain for the Six Nations rugby tournament, replacing Jamie George.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old lock takes the role for the first time, having previously deputised for George when the hooker has been replaced in the second half of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  George, who has had the armband since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, was demoted to vice-captain alongside Ellis Genge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itoje, who has 88 caps, was appointed as Saracens captain for this season, also ahead of George.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s a calm, influential leader, renowned for his commitment to upholding high standards and his ability to motivate those around him," England coach Steve Borthwick said. “His strong rapport with the squad and coaches, combined with his leadership experience at Saracens, makes him ideally placed to take on this responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Borthwick has picked a 36-man squad for the Six Nations that includes No 8 Tom Willis, but is missing veteran prop Dan Cole and scrumhalf Ben Spencer. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A British computer scientist on Tuesday urged countries to prioritise cooperation when it comes to the issue of safety in the development of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible," he said. "Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day financial forum hosted some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday launched a caring food coupon programme, allowing elderly people in need to taste dishes at discounted prices from the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 50,000 seniors, including those living alone, will receive a set of five coupons so they can try signature dishes from five catering groups for just HK$25 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coupons will be accepted from January 29 to late March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who officiated at a launching ceremony, said he hopes the elderly people will feel warmth through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a collaboration between the government, the business sector and the community, building a harmonious and caring society together," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to test out this programme, and see how to review it based on the experience. We hope more catering groups and restaurants will participate in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fast food chains taking part in the programme, Café de Coral, said it is a meaningful way to help the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have HK$25 baked pork chop rice, which is our signature dish. All the Café de Coral stores will offer this special price for the programme's participants," general manager Nelson Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other chains will offer dishes like boneless Hainan chicken rice, fish burgers, and char siu rice with sunny-side up eggs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election result if he hadn't been elected four years later, said a report by then special counsel Jack Smith released early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice's "view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Indeed, but for Mr Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the (Special Counsel's) Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20, had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify US President Joe Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the Republican's supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith, who was special counsel appointed to investigate Trump, dropped the federal criminal case against the incoming leader after he won November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after the report's overnight release, Trump hit back on his Truth Social platform, calling Smith "deranged", and adding he "was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss'."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1am in the morning," Trump added in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys had earlier urged US Attorney General Merrick Garland not to release the report, calling the plan to release it "unlawful, undertaken in bad faith, and contrary to the public interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith's report details Trump's alleged efforts to persuade state-level Republican lawmakers and leaders to "change the results" of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Trump contacted state legislators and executives, pressured them with false claims of election fraud in their states, and urged them to take action to ignore the vote counts and change the results," according to the report released by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significantly, he made election claims only to state legislators and executives who shared his political affiliation and were his political supporters, and only in states that he had lost," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the report alleges Trump and co-conspirators planned to organise individuals who would have served as his electors, if he had won the popular vote, in seven states where he lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- "and cause them to sign and send to Washington false certifications claiming to be the legitimate electors."
  <br>
  <br>
  They ultimately "used the fraudulent certificates to try to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The special counsel office concluded that "Trump's conduct violated several federal criminal statutes and that the admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed a separate case against the former and future president last year -- over Trump's handling of top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but charges are still pending against two of his former co-defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith left the justice department last week, days after submitting his final report as special counsel. (AFP)

    HK should cut down on red tape, survey finds

<img alt="About a third of mainland residents in Hong Kong felt the SAR could cut down on red tape. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787463_1_20250114144638.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly a third of mainland students and workers in Hong Kong said there is too much red tape in the city, according to a survey by a concern group helping young mainlanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 young and educated mainlanders who are working or studying in Hong Kong, participated in an online survey jointly conducted by the Youth Expats Association and two lawmakers, Gary Zhang and Johnny Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  The respondents were asked about their life in Hong Kong and their perspectives on the economy, culture and policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 30 percent said there is too much red tape in Hong Kong, such as regulations governing money transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The banking system is very troublesome if you want to make a legal transfer back to mainland China,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage.

    Serious abuse of public housing could be made a crime

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The impeachment trial of suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began on Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court deciding whether to strip him of his duties over a failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It has started," the Constitutional Court's spokesperson told international media, adding that the first hearing -- out of a confirmed five -- ended minutes later with Yoon not in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following sessions will take place on January 16, 21, 23 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. (AFP)

 North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea’s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint chiefs said the South Korean military had strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the US and Japanese militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a “clear provocation" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was North Korea’s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea said the January 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong-un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the US mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea. (AP)

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday authorities will comprehensively investigate any suspected links people or organisations may have with those who endanger national security, to see if any support or assistance has been given.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after prominent pollster Robert Chung was was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that plans to redevelop a cluster of government buildings in Wan Chai will go ahead, even though his predecessor, Carrie Lam, is moving her office there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam's relocation to Immigration Tower later this year comes after lawmakers complained about how much public money is being spent on the rent for her current office in Pacific Place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Wan Chai redevelopment plan will go ahead as planned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier explained that Lam rented the Grade A office space in Admiralty after her term ended in 2022 because there was no room for her at offices for former CEs in Mid-Levels.

<img alt="Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green scored 42 points against the Memphis Grizzlies at Toyota Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787438_1_20250114121505.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Green matched his career-high with 42 points and the Houston Rockets rallied from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 120-118 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jake LaRavia supplied the Grizzlies with a 100-87 lead when he stole the ball and sank a layup with 9:55 to play. The Rockets then began their comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were seven lead changes and two ties in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson posted 19 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two steals while teammate Alperen Sengun logged 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Cam Whitmore tallied 16 points and hit four 3-pointers off the bench. Houston made 16 of 31 from behind the arc and shot 50.6 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant paced the Grizzlies with 29 points but committed seven turnovers. Desmond Bane scored 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter for Memphis, which shot 52.9 percent but could not corral Green throughout the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston has won all three meetings with Memphis this season, two of them in the past five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 10 points as the Grizzlies jumped in from 18-11, but the Rockets answered with a 10-0 run that featured 3-pointers from Green and Dillon Brooks and yielded a 21-18 lead. Memphis responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Jaren Jackson Jr. 3-pointer that was part of a 12-2 close to the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies made 6 of 14 3-point attempts in the first and turned to their bench whenever the Rockets attempted to rally in the second. LaRavia scored 10 of Memphis' 24 first-half bench points, delivering a timely tip-in and a 3-pointer before a five-point surge from Whitmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green completed a four-point play that gave Houston a 55-54 lead, but Memphis scored the next six points and took a 60-57 halftime lead. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are [in captivity]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three men were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, firefighters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger was trapped in the truck and firefighters spent about two hours freeing him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After conducting a risk assessment and stabilising the injured person, the Disaster Response and Rescue Team arranged a crane to secure and lift the excavator and the stone block, while simultaneously using explosive tools to create enough space to enable us to rescue him,” Assistant Divisional Officer Kao Chung-lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men aged between 25 to 50, were conscious when taken to United Christian Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were investigating the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said frontline staff and inspectors should do more to ensure site safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Working on-site we have safety personnel and construction workers. They all bear significant responsibility. In situations like this, it's important to find out whether the frontline construction workers and management did their jobs properly," said chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Edward Ma from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said the group is really worried about serious industrial accidents occurring two days in a row, adding that safety awareness is still lacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven people were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code of practice on bamboo scaffolding safety was revised in October, requiring workers to hold a valid safety training certificate before carrying out such works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said on Tuesday that the administration would hold a conference with relevant stakeholders to seek improvements in the industry workflow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from looking into whether or not those involved, have fully complied with the code of practice, we have to look at, which is why we're going to hold a stakeholders conference, inviting not just those involved in scaffolding work, but also the principal contractors as well as those responsible for installing external glass walls,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's because we have to look at not just the scaffolding work itself, but also the workflow, and also the related work procedures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government will step up its inspections, as well as take enforcement action against those violating the law.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787420_2_20250114120033.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

 Hong Kong stocks opened higher on Tuesday, despite global markets mostly retreating after traders trimmed bets on US Federal Reserve rate cuts and oil extended a rally sparked by new sanctions on Russia's energy sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 27 points, or 0.15 percent, to open at 18,901.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<img alt="Two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off a weak opening and another uptick in Treasury bond yields amid shifting monetary policy expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices began the day in the same posture as Friday's session, when equities sold off after a strong jobs report was seen as dimming the odds for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,836, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent to 19,088, well above its session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market is less overbought compared with a few weeks ago after the sluggish beginning to 2025 equity trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is showing less sensitivity to higher bond yields," Haeling said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for about US$14.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intra-Cellular, which focuses on treatments for depression and schizophrenia, jumped 34.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moderna sank 16.8 percent as it projected 2025 revenues of between US$1.5 and US$2.5 billion, falling from the 2024 level of around US$3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail shares were mixed following financial updates that included inputs from the critical holiday shopping season. Macy's dropped 8.2 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 15.6 percent but Lululemon Athletica climbed 0.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes earnings from large banks, as well as economic releases on US inflation and retail sales. (AFP)

    Biden says Gaza ceasefire deal 'on the brink'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalised, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

 A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit south-western Japan, the country's meteorological agency said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centred, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9.19pm local time, according to the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tsunami can strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or go near coastal areas," the agency said on X.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

    Blue Origin pushes back launch of giant new rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin will have to wait a little longer for the long-anticipated maiden orbital flight of its brand-new rocket after a launch attempt dragged on for hours before being canceled due to unspecified technical issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary astronaut John Glenn, was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window starting at 1am (0600 GMT) on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the countdown repeatedly stalled as teams scrambled to resolve anomalies, before the mission was officially "scrubbed" around 3.10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are standing down today's launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue that will take us beyond our launch window," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin executive, during a livestream watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cornell added: "We are reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, billionaire Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos, who celebrated his 61st birthday on Sunday, watched the events unfold from the nearby launch control room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, for his part, wished Blue Origin "Good luck!" on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, told AFP, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket -- this week, upping the high-stakes rivalry. (AFP)

    SKorea to adapt airport barriers after plane crash

<img alt="Officials inspect the instrument landing system localiser area at the site where a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 aircraft crashed on December 29.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Monday said they would change the concrete barriers used for navigation at airports around the country after the Jeju Air crash that left 179 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the worst-ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improvement was deemed necessary including the localiser and its foundations for a total of nine facilities across seven airports, including Muan airport," the land ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would also apply to international airports in the cities of Jeju and Gimhae.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attention has focused on several possible causes but questions have been raised about why the concrete barricade, known as a localiser and used to help planes navigate their landings, was at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The barrier at Muan airport was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it would finalise plans to adapt the localisers by the end of January, with the aim of "completing upgrades within this year".
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation was further clouded on Saturday when the transport ministry said the black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed flight stopped recording four minutes before the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raided offices at Muan airport, a regional aviation office in the southwestern county, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul as the probe continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land ministry added that Muan airport's closure period had been extended until January 19. (AFP)

    HK can help companies diversify risk: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

 Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 wounded while fighting for Russia, a South Korean lawmaker said Monday, citing information from Seoul's spy agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent more than 10,000 soldiers to fight in the Ukraine conflict, in return for Russian technical assistance for Pyongyang's heavily sanctioned weapons and satellite programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, releasing video of the injured combatants being interrogated and raising the possibility of a prisoner swap for captured Ukrainian troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia has reportedly expanded to include the Kursk region, with estimates suggesting that casualties among North Korean forces have surpassed 3,000," lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a briefing from the spy agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes "approximately 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries," Lee said, after a briefing from Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers, reportedly from North Korea's elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Notably, memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some of the soldiers had been granted "amnesty" or wanted to join North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, hoping to improve their lot by fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIS analysis also revealed that the North Korean soldiers have "a lack of understanding of modern warfare," and are being used by Russia in a manner leading to "the high number of casualties," the lawmaker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee -- speaking for South Korea's intelligence committee in parliament -- said in the coming year, US president-elect Donald Trump, who has previously tried to woo North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, "may push for dialogue... once again".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Kim may "weigh the possibility of a visit to Russia in the first half of this year" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Zelensky said: "Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un's soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  There would "undoubtedly be more" North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available," said Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged that North Koreans have been deployed to fight. (AFP)

 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

    400mil pilgrims gather for giant Hindu festival

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vast crowds of Hindu pilgrims in India began bathing in sacred waters on Monday as the Kumbh Mela festival opened, with organisers expecting 400 million people -- the largest gathering of humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The millennia-old Kumbh Mela, a show of religious piety and ritual bathing -- and a logistical challenge of staggering proportions -- is held at the site where the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the cool pre-dawn gloom, pilgrims surged forward to begin bathing in the waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great joy," said Surmila Devi, 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like bathing in nectar."
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesswoman Reena Rai's voice quivered with excitement as she spoke about the "religious reasons" that brought her to join the sprawling tents, packed along the river banks in the north Indian city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Hindu, this is an unmissable occasion," said the 38-year-old, who travelled around 1,000 kilometres from Madhya Pradesh state to take part in the festival, which runs from Monday until February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saffron-robed monks and naked ash-smeared ascetics roamed the crowds offering blessings to devotees, many of whom had walked for weeks to reach the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive congregation is also an occasion for India's Hindu nationalist government to burnish its credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "divine occasion", that brings together "countless people in a sacred confluence of faith, devotion and culture".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Utter Pradesh's chief minister, welcomed devotees to "experience unity in diversity" at the "world's largest spiritual and cultural gathering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country -- with numbers expected to total around the combined populations of the United States and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some 350 to 400 million devotees are going to visit the mela, so you can imagine the scale of preparations," festival spokesman Vivek Chaturvedi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindu monks carried huge flags of their respective sects, while tractors turned into chariots for life-size idols of Hindu gods rolled by behind them accompanied by elephants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pilgrims exulted in the beat of drums and honking horns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organising authorities are calling it the great or "Maha" Kumbh Mela. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

<img alt="Chinese exports surged to record highs in 2024 as the prospect of a testing second Trump administration looms. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787274_1_20250113125415.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.

  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<img alt="Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook motions to Mavericks fans after scoring on a layup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787254_1_20250113102753.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) hands the ball off to running back Ty Johnson (26) in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787251_1_20250113101925.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen threw two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills trounced the Denver Broncos 31-7 to cruise into the next round of the NFL playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second-seeded Bills underscored their status as the biggest threat to Kansas City's hopes of reaching a fifth Super Bowl in six seasons by producing a dominant performance at their Highmark Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buffalo's wild card game victory sets up a blockbuster AFC divisional round clash next weekend against third seeded Baltimore, pitting Allen against the Ravens' reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great quarterback obviously with what he's able to do," Bills quarterback Allen said of his looming duel with Jackson. "He's one of the most dynamic if not the most dynamic quarterback in the league. He's fun to watch. But I'll be watching their defence this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen finished with 272 passing yards from 20-of-26 attempts, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with 46 rushing yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventh seeds Denver rocked Buffalo with a touchdown on the first drive of the game, quarterback Bo Nix finding receiver Troy Franklin with a deep pass for a 43-yard touchdown to mute the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills responded with 10 unanswered points, Tyler Bass slotting a 26-yard field goal and James Cook skipping into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver had a chance to tie the game on the stroke of halftime but Wil Lutz's 50-yard field goal attempt bounced back off the posts to leave Buffalo 10-7 ahead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills took a stranglehold on the game in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bass slotted a 27-yard field goal to make it 13-7, and after the Bills defense forced another Denver punt, Ty Johnson snagged a superb catch inches off the ground at the back of the end zone from Allen's pass to make it 19-7. A successful two-point conversion put the Bills 21-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen tossed his second touchdown pass at the start of the fourth quarter, picking out Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard touchdown that took the score to 28-7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's offense continued to be stymied by Buffalo's defense, their impotence summed up by a failure to convert a 4th&2 situation on their next possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen and the Bills took that opportunity to extend the lead to 31-7 with Bass's third field goal of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also means that the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will host the Houston Texans in the divisional round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles advanced in the NFC with a 22-10 win over a disappointing Green Bay Packers in a defensive grind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts returned after missing the past two games following a concussion and he showed no signs of rust with an early 11-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packers quarterback Jordan Love had a tough day, throwing an early interception with Darius Slay snaffling up the pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even when Love did manage to get Green Bay within field goal range, with a 13-play drive in the second quarter, Brandon McManus missed the kick from 38-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Love threw another interception at the end of the half and although McManus reduced the deficit with a 26-yard field goal in the third, Green Bay never looked in contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Goedert put Philadelphia 16-3 up when he collected a pass from Hurts and then burst towards the end-zone, delivering two stiff arms to keep Carrington Valentine at bay as he made the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josh Jacobs gave the Packers some hope with his one-yard rush after he had shown impressive power and strength on the previous play to break a series of tackles and make 31-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was the last productive moment from the Packers with two Jake Elliott field goals wrapping up the win for the Eagles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurts threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns while running back Saquon Barkley had 119-yards on 19 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how it looks and there's some things we can work on, improve on, the defence did a hell of a job and we got the win," said Barkley. (AFP)

    Atlético Madrid claim La Liga lead with Osasuna win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Julián Alvarez's strike helped Atlético Madrid move top of La Liga with 1-0 win over Osasuna.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side climbed one point clear of champions Real Madrid and six ahead of third-placed Barcelona at the halfway mark in the Spanish league season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético claimed a 14th consecutive victory across all competitions, a new club record, and have lost just one top-flight game all season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their eighth straight league win and a fifth clean sheet from those matches, with Simeone's side back to their miserly best in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been doing a great job, we know that it's not over here and there's a long way to go, a lot of games to come," Alvarez said. "We have to continue on this path, to keep working with humility, and good things will come."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético started well against an Osasuna side with several regular starters left on the bench, including their top scorer, striker Ante Budimir.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antoine Griezmann had an early goal ruled out for handball, while his strike-partner Alvarez missed Atlético's best chances of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearest came when Rodrigo De Paul scooped a pass over the top for the Argentina international, but Alvarez's effort, which bounced awkwardly off his shoulder, was saved by Sergio Herrera.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Moreno's visitors, 11th, improved as the first half progressed and managed to keep Atlético largely at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  However early in the second half a clever Rojiblancos corner routine helped them break the deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griezmann's whipped cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger area by Clement Lenglet and Alvarez was able to slam home from close range for his sixth league goal since joining last summer from Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a move we've been working on, we've had some days to train, to make these strategies," explained Alvarez. "Luckily today it came off, it's important to score from dead balls, because it can be decisive, above all in hard-fought games like these, which are tricky."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were not at their sharpest but had more than enough to seal another victory and claim top spot, with Osasuna not troubling Jan Oblak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Getafe earned a 2-1 win at Las Palmas to climb three points above the relegation zone. (AFP)

    Barca smash Real Madrid to win Spanish Super Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona hammered rivals Real Madrid 5-2 in a wild Spanish Super Cup Clasico final in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to win the first trophy of the Hansi Flick era.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead but a dominant Barcelona hit five in response before their goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to avenge their 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in October's La Liga Clasico but instead were left battered and bruised by their arch-rivals in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Mbappé's opener, Lamine Yamal levelled and Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead from the penalty spot, with Raphinha bagging a brace and Alejandro Balde also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo Goes pulled one back for Madrid with a free-kick but they could not capitalise further on their numerical advantage in a humiliating defeat for the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice, it had been a season since we won a trophy, it's always special and on top of that in a Clasico against Real Madrid," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde said. "We had a lot of calm and patience, knowing that if we applied the plan we would win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very proud and happy with the team," he added. "Right after the red card, we got together and said we were going to have to suffer, sit back, but we had a big advantage and this can't escape us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team's poor defending was the main reason for the heavy defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We defended badly and that cost us the game – they found their goals quite easily," Ancelotti said. "We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that – we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both coaches opted to maintain the same line-ups they started with in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal issued Madrid an early warning with a curling effort from the right which forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a strong stop to keep a Raphinha header at bay after the Brazilian evaded Lucas Vázquez with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Barcelona's opening salvo it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the fifth minute with Mbappé's brilliant goal on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward, frustrated numerous times by the offside flag in the league defeat by the Catalans, broke loose on the halfway line after Vinicius won the ball back and, after bursting into the area, clipped past Szczesny.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took a stunning individual goal from 17-year-old Yamal to level the scoreline, with the Spanish winger cutting in from the right before stroking home a low finish inside the near post in a similar style to former Barca great Lionel Messi, to whom he is often compared. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten-man Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-3 on penalties after a dramatic 1-1 draw in the FA Cup third round, while Tottenham needed extra time before seeing off non-league Tamworth 3-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defeated 2-0 by Arsenal in the Premier League in December, FA Cup holders United exacted revenge on their return to the Emirates Stadium to extend their revival after last weekend's impressive draw at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's troubled side took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, who smashed a superb strike into the far corner from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  United defender Diogo Dalot was sent off for a second booking after fouling Mikel Merino nine minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed Arsenal's equaliser in the 63rd minute, the Brazilian defender swivelling to hit a low shot that took a hefty deflection off Matthijs de Ligt.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal wasted a golden opportunity to take the lead when Harry Maguire's soft challenge on Kai Havertz was ruled a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The furious United defender and team-mate Manuel Ugarte were involved in a melee with several Arsenal players before Altay Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard's spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz missed a host of chances to win it and the German was culpable again in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Bayindir, setting up the much-maligned Joshua Zirkzee to stroke home the decisive kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to pass through this round because we all suffered together and showed character," said Amorim, whose side host Leicester in the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few weeks ago Joshua was in a difficult moment, now he was a game-changer," he added. "Life has these beautiful things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another painful result for Arsenal after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg and last weekend's damaging league draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a thousand games like this you lose one," said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta, who hasn't won a trophy since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's unbelievable," he added. "We deserved to win the game by a mile. But the reality is we are out and the only thing that's going to be judged is that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham, who are currently 12th in the Premier League, are 96 places above Tamworth – who sit 16th in the fifth-tier National League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supposed gap in quality was rarely apparent as Tottenham's dismal display took them to the brink of a historic humiliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A part-time team whose players work day jobs alongside their football careers, Tamworth matched their highly-paid and supposedly superior opponents for long periods on the Lamb Ground's sloping artificial pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should have caused one of the FA Cup's greatest upsets in normal time but their missed chances proved crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Tshikuna's extra-time own goal and late strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson sent Tottenham into the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a major trophy in 2008, but the under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou boasts he always wins silverware in his second season at a club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having beaten Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Tottenham remain in contention for a domestic cup double despite a troubled season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They made it hard for us, with the surface it was about us staying calm and being persistent. In the end, we got the job done," said Postecoglou, whose team travel to Aston Villa in the fourth round. (AFP)

<img alt="Health officials said no patient treatments were affected by the deployment of staff to attend two Kai Tak test events. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787185_1_20250112165215.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Sunday that around 1,700 staff members have been deployed to two test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park - but it stressed that this had "not in any way" affected the treatment of patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The clarification came after multiple media reports suggested some patients had to reschedule their bookings because medical staff were drafted in to take part in upcoming drills to gauge the park's crowd management measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department confirmed that staff will be sent to drills on January 24 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said minor adjustments were made to the appointment dates for non-therapeutic student health services with the consent of service recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All have been agreed by the members of the public concerned and only two appointments will be postponed by one working day, while the others will be brought forward by two to 10 working days," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that the Student Health Service provides regular health assessment and health education of a preventive nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, it pledged to make more careful planning and strengthen internal co-ordination when deploying staff for future drills, so as to minimise disruption to public services.

    Industry to bear cost of cigarette tax labels: Customs

<img alt="Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat says the labelling system is aimed at targeting untaxed cigarettes attempting to pass off as legal, duty-paid ones. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787178_1_20250112155320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs say tobacco firms will likely have to bear the cost of an upcoming labelling system which will help consumers differentiate duty-paid cigarettes from illicit ones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat explained the proposed scheme is aimed at weeding out untaxed cigarettes which boast identical or similar packaging to their duty-paid counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both feature government health warnings, and can be difficult to distinguish even by retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said one way to implement the scheme is to introduce anti-forgery features on the packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labels will be similar to anti-forgery features on banknotes, which are hard to replicate," Chan told a television programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be a digital tag to be scanned. The tag can be attached when the cigarettes are produced but duty has not been paid. When duty is paid, we can activate the label from the back end. Then we will know the batch has been taxed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed concerns that tobacco companies will transfer the extra costs to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our initial thought is to have the tobacco industry shoulder the cost. Currently, a pack of cigarettes on the market is sold for over HK$100. The cost of adding labels is minimal and will have no impact on the selling price," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also looking to introduce stiffer penalties for people who flout a law on the permitted amount of cigarettes they can bring into Hong Kong tax-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, each traveller can carry 19 sticks of cigarettes every time they enter the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are looking to amend legislation within this year, so offenders will be fined HK$5,000, up from HK$2,000.

<img alt="President Biden had cited national security concerns when he blocked the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787187_1_20250112170252.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US authorities have extended the deadline for Japan's Nippon Steel to abandon its acquisition of its American rival after President Joe Biden blocked the deal, the companies said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden cited national security concerns as he put a stop to the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to the Japanese giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing the president of "illegal interference", the companies filed a legal review with the US court of appeals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will now hold off enforcing the order until June 18, Nippon Steel and US Steel said, extending an initial 30-day deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) has granted an extension to June 18, 2025 of the requirement in President Biden's Executive Order that the parties permanently abandon the transaction," the companies said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to completing the transaction, which secures the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the outgoing president's decision to block the transaction enjoyed rare bipartisan support at home, it drew sharp criticism from the Japanese government and business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's industry minister labelled it "incomprehensible" and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called on Washington to "explain clearly" its rationale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to appropriately deal with the issue while not undermining the big picture of the Japan-US alliance," Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will ask the US side to remove concerns which are spreading in the business community," he said during a television debate. (AFP)

    Zheng Qinwen through at rain-hit Melbourne Park

<img alt="China's Zheng Qinwen (left) is congratulated by Romania's Anca Todoni after her victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787174_1_20250112151256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour's play was possible outside by early evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn't get any tennis," said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've paid 60 bucks and haven't seen anything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na's Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old's last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes," Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let's keep going playing with pressure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men's second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty nice, man. First time in my life I'm playing on a good court," the 20th seed said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it's much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Women's favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena. (Reuters)

<img alt="Paul Chan said a new chapter discussing cooperation with Gulf countries has been added to this week's Asian Financial Forum. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787162_1_20250112122438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said an annual financial forum this week includes a new discussion panel on how to cooperate with Gulf countries, as Hong Kong looks to grasp development opportunities with the Global South.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the Asian Financial Forum - set to begin on Monday - will host some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions, a scale similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The forum sets up a new chapter on the Gulf Cooperation Council, making new explorations on how to deepen financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, while encouraging more bilateral capital flows," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hong Kong businesses to grasp the new development opportunities brought by the emerging markets. These include the Middle East, as well as nations from Asean and the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also noted that the SAR serve as a platform for countries like Indonesia to raise funds for products such as catastrophe bonds, or infrastructure and green projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, he led a 130-strong delegation to Jakarta to conduct business exchange and lure investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said given the risks of disasters brought by climate change, companies can opt for Hong Kong's catastrophe bond products, raise funds through issuing bonds in different currencies, or establish trusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that Indonesian representatives also expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten startups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park took part in dozens of business matching sessions, potentially reeling in over US$5 million of business, Chan revealed.

<img alt="The suspended South Korean president has been holed up in the presidential residence since his short-lived declaration of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787171_1_20250112144935.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol will not attend the first hearing of his impeachment trial next week because of safety concerns, his lawyer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been holed up in the presidential residence and protected by an elite guard force since being suspended and impeached last month, following a short-lived declaration of martial law that plunged the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has refused to meet prosecutors and investigators and his presidential guard unit thwarted an attempt to arrest him following a tense, hours-long standoff earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has scheduled five trial dates spanning January 14 to February 4, which will proceed in his absence if he does not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the President will not be able to attend the trial on January 14," lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement sent to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President is willing to appear at any time once safety issues are resolved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will decide whether to uphold his impeachment or restore him to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, investigators seeking to question Yoon on insurrection charges linked to his ill-fated martial law declaration are preparing another arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have repeatedly said an initial seven-day warrant and the new one they secured this week were both "unlawful".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have kept secret the length of the new warrant, with local media reports saying it is longer than the previous seven days.

  Rival protesters for and against Yoon have gathered almost daily in the South Korean capital since the crisis unfolded.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday more demonstrations were planned by rival camps outside Yoon's residence and on the streets of Seoul -- either calling for his impeachment to be declared invalid or for him to be detained immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's legal team say his guards remain on "high alert".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested if investigators are able to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, he faces prison or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) officials and police are planning for the next attempt, which they said could be their last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO said anyone obstructing their attempt could be detained themselves and police reportedly held a meeting of top commanders on Friday to plan for the renewed effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Presidential Security Service (PSS) chief Park Chong-jun -- who resigned on Friday and was automatically replaced by a more hardline Yoon loyalist -- told reporters there must be no bloodshed in any second arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced two days of questioning and did not explain his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am cooperating as diligently as possible with the authorities' investigation," he told reporters Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hun, refused to turn up to a third summons on Saturday claiming he had to protect Yoon, opening him up to possible arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jin-ha, head of the service's security and safety division, was questioned on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Office of Investigation, a police unit, sent a note to high-ranking police officials in Seoul requesting they prepare to mobilise 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the crisis goes on Yoon's ruling party has seen a bump in approval ratings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Gallup survey published Friday showed the People Power Party's approval rating had risen to 34 percent from 24 percent three weeks ago. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A six-member task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk has set off for Thailand on Sunday to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force comprises officials from the Security Bureau, as well as police and the Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Cheuk said the Thai government is very concerned about the issue and is willing to arrange a meeting with SAR officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have been communicating with the relevant authorities. In terms of the latest development, we hope to meet them face-to-face and understand the situation and to seek all feasible help from them and see how we collaborate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the operation goal, we for sure want all Hongkongers to come back safely. This is our ultimate goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted criminals are adopting new methods to lure victims to Southeast Asian countries. These include asking people to help bring packages to Japan or Taiwan, but then changing the destination to a Southeast Asian country at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force will also meet officials from the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, and talk to Ministry of Justice representatives on an anti-human trafficking committee chaired by the Thai prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen have already returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said the remaining 12 are aged 21 to 43, and none were abducted. They reported restrictions on their movement but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Security Bureau revealed on Saturday that it had recently received an assistance request from the family of an SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman, in her twenties, was reportedly detained in a Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the case had since been taken up by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and the local Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relevant parities provided advice and all feasible help based on the family’s wishes, and it is understood the woman has returned to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau called on the public to be vigilant against online job advertisements which are too good to be true - either those which claim to offer quick money, or highly-paid positions which do not require any work experience or academic qualification.
