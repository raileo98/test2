<div class="itemFullText">
 The search-and-rescue effort has entered its final stage after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Dingri County in the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China on Tuesday, the regional government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The focus of work has shifted to the resettlement of quake-affected residents and post-disaster reconstruction, said Hong Li, head of the regional emergency management department at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will spare no effort in searching for those who are still unaccounted for and treating the injured, Hong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 rescuers have been dispatched for the search-and-rescue work, and have found and rescued 407 people, said Wang Fanghong, mayor of Xigaze, which administers Dingri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always taken safeguarding people's lives as the top priority, and have organised disaster prevention works in a timely manner, properly relocating those affected while minimising casualties," Wang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of aftershocks have been reported after Tuesday's quake that killed at least 126 people and injured 188 others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inspecting the rescue efforts, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing again called for all-out efforts to find survivors and treat the injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the importance of ensuring those living in temporary shelters safe and warm. (Xinhua and agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 People who report illegal public housing use can earn up to HK$3,000 starting from January 15 if their information helps authorities evict tenants who break the rules, the Housing Authority announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the authority said the Report Public Housing Abuse Award scheme aims to safeguard the use of public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  People aged 16 or above can report any misuse through multiple channels, including online forms, hotlines, email and estate offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  An assessment panel will review cases and make final decisions, especially for complicated situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said the identities of informants will be kept confidential, though they must provide their real name when reporting and be interviewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the HA [Housing Authority] implemented new measures to enhance combating tenancy abuse, cases that are relatively easy to detect have been discovered. To identify remaining hidden cases, more investigative clues from the public are needed," the statement read.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda craze is picking up speed, thanks to the launch of a panda-themed high-speed rail train by the MTR Corporation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Saturday, passengers travelling to Shenzhen or Guangzhou will be treated to cartoon illustrations of pandas striking playful poses and indulging in Hong Kong delicacies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the furry creatures are set against iconic Hong Kong landmarks, including the Big Buddha and the Convention and Exhibition Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [pandas] will act as travel ambassadors," MTR general manager Annie Leung told a media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They will] showcase some rich and unique aspects of Hong Kong to the travellers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch of the panda-themed high-speed train followed the debut of similar trains on the South Island Line and Airport Express in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains are part of a broader citywide celebration tied to Ocean Park's giant pandas, which aims to promote local tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-adorned train will run for 12 weeks until April 4.

    'Inbound tourism during the holiday should be strong'

<img alt="Tommy Tam says the industry stands to benefit from mega events and large-scale sports activities held in the SAR. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786678_1_20250108192742.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Travel Industry Council has expressed mixed views towards inbound and outbound tourism for the upcoming Lunar New Year break.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Tam, who was elected as the council’s new chairman last month, described the prospects of inbound tourism as "good".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong can expect an influx of individual mainland visitors and travellers from Southeast Asian countries during the holiday, courtesy of the high-speed rail link and short-haul flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident it will be better than before," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tam is less upbeat with outbound tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some Hong Kong people may not be able to book high-speed train tickets due to the Spring Festival rush on the mainland, contributing to a drop in outbound tour groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam also said some may have trouble securing flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The long-haul flight resumption is still under progress, so if there are not sufficient long-haul flights, this may cause high fares and the limited seats supply.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the council expressed confidence in the tourism sector in the coming year, saying that the industry will have more opportunities, such as mega events and large-scale sports activities held in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will continue to attract more new blood to the trade, especially young people, in order to reach the goal of having 210,000 workers in five years’ time.

    UK expands Electronic Travel Authorisation

<img alt="Eligible travellers will need one even if they are just using the UK to connect to an onward flight abroad. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786690_1_20250108215342.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to the UK from dozens of countries and regions - including the Hong Kong SAR, the United States, Canada and Australia - must now pay to enter Britain after a new visa-waiver entry system was extended on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme -- similar to the ESTA system in the United States -- requires visitors who do not need a visa to enter Britain to acquire pre-travel authorisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Costing £10 (US$12.50) and allowing stays of up to six months at a time over two years, it first launched in 2023, with Qatar, before being extended last year to five regional Gulf neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, it has been expanded to include citizens of around 50 more countries and territories, from Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand to Japan, South Korea and Caribbean nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the system kicking in for them on Wednesday, they have been able to apply since last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme, aimed at tightening border security, will next be extended to dozens of EU and European countries and territories on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those citizens covered by the scheme will be able to apply for the new ETA -- which is digitally linked to the traveller's passport -- via an app, from March 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around six million people from the United States, Canada and Australia visit Britain each year, according to the UK government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible travellers will need one even if they are just using the UK to connect to an onward flight abroad. ETA also applies to children and babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naila Hadi, a US woman in her fifties, told AFP at London's Heathrow Airport that the new system was "easy" to navigate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on our phones and they just scanned the passport, because this passport has a chip,... and within 20 minutes we got our approval," said Hadi, who had arrived from New Jersey with her daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackie Day, a 77-year-old arriving from Vancouver, said: "My only quibble is that when I selected the country I was applying from, Canada, I had to pay in US dollars."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had to scan the passport, I had to scan my face plus take a picture of my face and fill out basic information about where I live, nothing complicated," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Northern Ireland economy minister Conor Murphy warned that ETA will have a "devastating" impact on tourism in the British province, given that its neighbour the Republic of Ireland is not involved with the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murphy fears that the cost and red tape will deter international tourists visiting the Republic from making the journey across the land border to visit Northern Ireland, and has called for a time-limited exemption for people visiting up to seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heathrow has also opposed the scheme, saying its rollout has reduced the number of passengers transiting through the UK, and that it makes the country "less competitive" and harms economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new requirement does not apply to British and Irish citizens, those with passports from British overseas territories and legal UK residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  It does not change the requirements for citizens of countries who need a visa to visit Britain, such as Chinese, Ecuadorian and South African travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, most visitors not requiring a visa could arrive at a British airport and proceed through immigration control with their passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new UK entry scheme mirrors the imminent ETIAS scheme for visa-exempt nationals travelling to 30 European countries, including France and Germany, which will cost seven euros ($7.40) and last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission expects the system -- which will apply to around 60 countries, including the United States, Canada, Brazil and the UK -- to become operational in the middle of this year. (AFP)

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

 A rapidly growing series of wildfires raged across sections of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying numerous buildings, clogging roadways as more than 30,000 people evacuated their homes, while a second blaze doubled in size some 50 kilometres inland and a third began in the San Fernando Valley. Firefighters battled the wind-whipped fires throughout the day as officials prepared for the situation to worsen early Wednesday local time.

   <br>
   At least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal towns of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned by the Palisades Fire, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather.
   <br>
   <br>
   A fire official told local television station KTLA that several people were injured, some with burns to faces and hands.
   <br>
   <br>
   The official added that one female firefighter had sustained a head injury.
   <br>
   <br>
   The second blaze dubbed the Eaton Fire broke out some 50 kilometres inland near Pasadena and doubled in size to 400 acres (162 hectares) in a few hours, according to Cal Fire.
   <br>
   <br>
   Almost 100 residents from a nursing home in Pasadena were evacuated, according to CBS News.
   <br>
   <br>
   Video showed elderly residents, many in wheelchairs and on gurneys, crowded onto a smokey and windswept parking lot as fire trucks and ambulances attended.
   <br>
   <br>
   Fire officials said a third blaze named the Hurst Fire had started in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuations of some nearby residents.

   Witnesses reported a number of homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean.
   <br>
   <br>
   Local media reported the fire had spread north, torching homes near Malibu.
   <br>
   <br>
   Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley had earlier told a press conference that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened.
   <br>
   <br>
   Firefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames.
   <br>
   <br>
   Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed.
   <br>
   <br>
   The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said.
   <br>
   <br>
   With only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot.
   <br>
   <br>
   Cindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were "this close to the cars," demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger.
   <br>
   <br>
   "People left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going," Festa said from her car.
   <br>
   <br>
   Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 80 to 130 kph.
   <br>
   <br>
   With low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were "about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather," the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X.
   <br>
   <br>
   Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added.
   <br>
   <br>
   The powerful winds changed President Joe Biden's travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles.
   <br>
   <br>
   He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House.
   <br>
   <br>
   "I have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire," Biden said in a statement.
   <br>
   <br>
   A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said.
   <br>
   <br>
   Pacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, "I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing." (Reuters)

    More trains, flights to handle Spring Festival rush

<img alt="Mainland authorities are expecting a record Spring Festival travel rush. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786642_1_20250108163941.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they will increase capacity during the upcoming Spring Festival travel rush, which is expected to be the busiest ever.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 40-day period, also known as "Chunyun" season, will run from January 14 to February 22, with the Year of the Snake starting on January 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities expect the number of inter-regional trips to hit 9 billion, and rail and flight passenger trips to exceed 510 million and 90 million respectively, all record highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The scale of the Spring Festival travel rush will further increase this year. It's also the first year that Lunar New Year's Eve is a national holiday, so there will be eight days off in total during the Spring Festival," Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passenger flows will be higher before and after the holiday, and the NDRC and other bodies have conducted early research and planning. We'll adopt comprehensive measures to try our best to meet the demands of the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  To accommodate higher passenger flows, Li said more than 140,000 railway trains will be arranged on average each day during the travel rush, up 4 percent year on year, while the daily number of flights will be about 185,000, up 8.4 percent from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also said passenger flows will be particularly high in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions, as well as in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of road trips, meanwhile, is projected to reach 7.2 billion, accounting for about 80 percent of the total, and daily highway traffic could also hit a record high.

    OpenAI chief Sam Altman denies sex abuse allegations

<img alt="OpenAI chief Sam Altman has denied sexual abuse allegations against his sister. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786653_1_20250108171225.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Open AI CEO Sam Altman on Tuesday denied allegations from his sister Annie Altman, who has filed a complaint accusing him of childhood sexual abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, especially Sam," the boss of the California startup said in a letter co-signed by his mother and two brothers, and published on social platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our family loves Annie and is very concerned about her well-being. Caring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult," they wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Silicon Valley's more charismatic figures, Altman shot to global fame with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, which ignited a race to advance AI research and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prolific entrepreneur and already a billionaire, Altman, 39, has set himself the mission of developing a so-called "general" AI, with cognitive abilities similar to those of humans and which "benefits all of humanity".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Altman family said that they have tried to help their daughter and sister, covering her expenses and guaranteeing her "monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us," they said, pointing out that they have decided to respond publicly following Anne's legal complaint filed on Monday, and after years of tension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child," said the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these claims are utterly untrue."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the complaint, Annie -- who is nine years younger than Sam Altman -- alleges the assaults took place from 1997, when she was three, until 2006.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a report for New York Magazine in 2023, a journalist who met Annie in Hawaii described her as an artist suffering from depression and the growing rift with her family, and supporting herself mainly through online sex work. (AFP)

    'Gov't mulling further curbs against ticket scalping'

<img alt="Rosanna Law called on the public to buy tickets through official channels. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786639_1_20250108163000.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it’s considering further ways to combat ticket scalping, including possible legislation to ban the practice at government-owned venues.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to a question from lawmaker Chan Kin-por, culture, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said legislative options would be considered “in a prudent manner” – noting that such a move has both pros and cons, “given the multiple causes of ticket scalping, which involve various factors including supply and demand, market structure, regulation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that although real-name registration for ticket buyers has helped, not all organisers want to adopt this measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to communicate with stakeholders, because different organisers have their different ticketing considerations," Law said during a Legislative Council session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though I think real-name registration for tickets is the most effective way to tackle the issue of scalpers, the organisers often don't consider this to be their first option. We have to respect such business operations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also called on spectators to buy tickets through official channels, saying it's risky to buy through unauthorised means, especially at heightened prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official records show that no one was convicted of ticket scalping near concert venues between 2022 and the first half of last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers have expressed concern that scalping has become more rampant, saying Hong Kong's image could be at stake when tourists buy problematic tickets.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said Hong Kong's doors are wide open to professionals and businesses from Indonesia, adding the SAR has a lot to offer as a "super connector" between the mainland and the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a symposium in Jakarta, Chan said Hong Kong and Indonesia are "ideal partners" and Indonesian companies are welcome to set up headquarters in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in facilitating foreign investment into the Chinese mainland, serving as the largest source of overseas direct investment in the whole of China and a crucial gateway for channelling foreign capital into the Chinese economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief noted that Hong Kong's securities market has a capitalisation of over US$4.4 trillion, and pools both mainland and international capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In other words, any Indonesian company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be able to tap into both mainland and international capital," Chan said.

    'Plan to build homes gave arts hub a lifeline'

<img alt="Bernard Chan, vice-chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, says the proposed housing project will be crucial to maintain the arts hub's operations. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786632_1_20250108160319.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government decision last year allowing the sale of commercial and residential facilities at the West Kowloon arts hub gave the cash-strapped project a shot in the arm, the vice-chairman of its managing authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a funding proposal, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority on Wednesday said it plans to build seven residential blocks south of Austin Road West that could offer nearly 2,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the government endorsed the sale of residential developments within Zone 2 of the site by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That news itself already helped us a great deal," Bernard Chan, the authority's vice-chairman, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It allowed us to talk to the bankers... The fact that we now potentially have a future income stream coming from the sale of these residential units, we're able to get refinancing and we can generate the necessary funding... to allow the authority to continue to operate."
  <br>
  <br>
  That, Chan said, helped to overcome a "timing mismatch" with the development of arts and culture facilities outpacing that of commercial and residential sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The faster we open our new [arts and culture] facilities, the more losses we will incur. In the meantime, our income has yet to materialise, because we haven't really been able to generate any income from our commercial sites," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was always, from day one, the plan to use the commercial, residential area to subsidise the arts and culture offerings. This residential [area] is actually going to help us to finance the investment that we put in the arts and culture sites."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the residential project will help the arts hub stay afloat for at least a decade.

 A magnitude 5.5 earthquake shook China's northwestern province of Qinghai at 3.44pm on Wednesday, according to the China Earthquake Networks Centre (CENC).
 <br>
  <br>
  No casualties or property damage have been reported.
  <br>

    'Boost tourism at cruise terminal, Sports Park'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law said officials are exploring ways to enhance the operation of the cruise terminal and optimise the use of Kai Tak Sports Park to boost tourism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the first antechamber exchange session of the year, Law said she received valuable feedback and suggestions regarding the new tourism blueprint, with officials and members in attendance including Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk and Legco President Andrew Leung.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her expectations for the new operator of the terminal would significantly improve its performance, adding that she also hopes to improve the use of the shoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no 'the best situation', there is only better operation. So this is my constant expectation, and in the new tendering exercise, of course we will be reviewing the criteria imposed so far. After all, the cruise terminal has been in operation for more than 10 years and the same operator has been operating the terminal," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know that society and, of course, myself and my colleagues in the CSTB (Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau) have different views on the operation of the cruise terminal and how it might be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also noted that she had received insights and suggestions on how to enhance Kai Tak Sports Park's potential as a world-class venue for mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told RTHK it is necessary for greater collaboration with local investment groups interested in funding sporting events at Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The infrastructure, the hardware is fantastic. I've been to that already. Right now, I think that it all comes down to kind of software, what kind of events are we going to be hosting, the frequency of the event that we'll be hosting, the quality of it, and also how do we maintain this kind of standard throughout the years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got the big stadium, 50,000 people capable, and the smaller arena, you can have 10,000 plus people. So obviously, the scale of it is huge. In hosting this kind of scale of events, we need to engage local sports community to have athletes, organisers and all that, but more at the same time, sponsors as well as sort of investors too. I think that we need to ramp that up in a very near future."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Vincent Cheng, who is also vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, praised the transportation arrangements and crowd management during the recent test events at the Sports Park, but noted the importance of addressing additional issues, such as dining options, to maximise the potential of the local sports economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another DAB member, Brave Chan, suggested that officials should permit more private vehicles from the mainland to enter Hong Kong during holidays. He also recommended extending docking times for international and mainland private yachts and cruise ships to attract more tourists to the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former lawmaker Chim Pui-chung and his son Ricky Chim will be sentenced on February 3 over a fraud case.
 <br>
  <br>
  The District Court heard their mitigation on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud more than HK$42 million in transactions linked to a listed company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court earlier convicted Chim Pui-chung, who was the largest shareholder of Asia Resources, and his 55-year-old son, who was the chairman, for conspiring with mainland businessman Ma Zhonghong to defraud the company, its board and shareholders between July 2013 and November 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman, Wong Poe-lai, was convicted of money laundering in connection with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chim Pui-chung, 78, submitted more than 10 mitigation letters to the court, including letters from former Legco president Jasper Tsang Yok-sing and former financial secretary John Tsang.
  <br>
  <br>
  His defence lawyer also said his client is in poor health. He had suffered from throat cancer, heart disease and a stroke.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Ernest Lin adjourned the case to February 3 for sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three defendants were remanded in custody until sentencing next month.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quentin Grimes was the unlikely hero for Dallas as the injury-hit Mavericks out-classed LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 118-97 to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grimes came off the bench to score 23 points and grab nine rebounds, drilling six of the Mavericks' 18 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, last season's Western Conference champions, had gone 1-5 since losing Luka Doncic to a calf strain on Christmas Day. Still without the Slovenian star, they announced on Monday that Kyrie Irving would be sidelined for some time with a lower back sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by as many as six in the second quarter, the Mavs closed the first half on an 11-0 scoring run to take a 55-50 lead and never trailed in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 21 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Lakers and James added 18 points, 10 boards and eight assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Dallas out-rebounded the Lakers 44-33 and with 11 offensive rebounds managed 15 second-chance points to the Lakers' seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  P.J. Washington scored 22 points, Spencer Dinwiddie added 19 and Klay Thompson chipped in 13 for Dallas – who bumped the Lakers from fifth place in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew we had to get back on track," Grimes told broadcaster TNT. "Came out with the right mindset after dropping five in a row, so good to get back on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach JJ Redick said his team's inability to defend the perimeter was key.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the energy, It felt like we played a little tired tonight," he said. "When you're on the road and the other team is banging threes, it can be a little deflating to the overall energy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Anthony Edwards scored 32 points with nine rebounds to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-97 victory over the Pelicans, spoiling Pels star Zion Williamson's return from a two-month injury absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson scored 22 points with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Dejounte Murray led New Orleans with 29 points, but CJ McCollum had a rough night – scoring just five points on one-for-14 shooting. (AFP)

    Trump signals his interest in Greenland, Panama Canal

<img alt="US President-elect Trump has fueled speculation about his interest in Greenland. During his first term in office, Trump expressed interest in buying the resource-rich and strategic Arctic island. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786599_1_20250108115420.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, as he declared US control of both to be vital to American national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters less than two weeks before he takes office on January 20 and as a delegation of aides and advisers, that includes Donald Trump Jr., is in Greenland, Trump left open the use of the American military to secure both territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's intention marks a rejection of decades of US policy that has prioritised self-determination over territorial expansion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m not going to commit to that," Trump said, when asked if he would rule out the use of the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It might be that you’ll have to do something. The Panama Canal is vital to our country.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added, “We need Greenland for national security purposes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenland, home to a large US military base, is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime US ally and a founding member of Nato.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump cast doubts on the legitimacy of Denmark's claim to Greenland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Canal has been solely controlled by the eponymous country for more than 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US returned the Panama Canal Zone to the country in 1979 and ended its joint partnership in controlling the strategic waterway in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing Trump's comments in an interview with Danish broadcaster TV2, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the United States Denmark’s “most important and closest ally,” and that she did not believe that the United States would use military or economic power to secure control over Greenland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frederiksen repeated that she welcomed the United States taking a greater interest in the Arctic region, but that it would “have to be done in a way that is respectful of the Greenlandic people,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, it must be done in a way that allows Denmark and the United States to still cooperate in, among other things, Nato,” Frederiksen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trump posted a video of his private plane landing in Nuuk, the Arctic territory’s capital, in a landscape of snow-capped peaks and fjords.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Don Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland,” Trump wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength, and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen. MAGA. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Greenland’s government said Donald Trump Jr.’s visit was taking place “as a private individual” and not as an official visit, and Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha said his government hasn’t had formal contact with Trump or representatives of the incoming administration, but reiterated previous comments from the country’s president, José Raúl Mulino, who said last month that the canal will remain in Panamanian hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,” Martínez-Acha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, a Republican, has also floated having Canada join the United States as the 51st state. He said Tuesday that he would not use military force to invade the country, which is home to more than 40 million people and is a founding Nato partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, he said, he would would rely on “economic force" as he cast the US trade deficit with Canada — a natural resource-rich nation that provides the US with commodities like crude oil and petroleum — as a subsidy that would be coming to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders fired back after earlier dismissing Trump's rhetoric as a joke .
  <br>
  <br>
  “President-elect Trump’s comments show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country. Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said in a post on X. (AP)

    West Kowloon arts hub outlines residential development

<img alt="The proposed development is expected to offer a total gross floor area of 134,500 square metres. Image from Yau Tsim Mong District Council document" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786594_1_20250108105828.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The managing authority of the West Kowloon arts hub has outlined plans to build seven residential blocks that could offer nearly 2,000 private sector flats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Located south of Austin Road West, the proposed development also includes three multi-purpose basement levels and three other storeys above ground for retail, catering and entertainment, according to a document submitted to the Yau Tsim Mong District Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The West Kowloon Cultural District Authority said the development plan would take up roughly 20,000 square metres of land.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan would have a total gross floor area of 134,500 square metres, with some 80 percent coming from the residential project that's expected to provide up to 1,995 housing units.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing blocks would create a stepped profile to "maintain the decent views looking out from Hong Kong Island" to the waterfront in West Kowloon, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footbridges and walkways would be part of the plan, connecting the project with Kowloon MTR Station and Elements, the shopping mall nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority is planning to apply to the Town Planning Board for planning permission in the first quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July last year, the Executive Council conditionally agreed to a funding proposal to allow the authority to sell some of its land parcels and keep all proceeds received from tenders to private developers to ease a financial shortfall.

    Dennis Lo assumes office as head of CUHK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Professor Dennis Lo, the ninth Vice-Chancellor and President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said he will strive to enhance the institution's international status.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assuming office on Wednesday, Lo said he was honoured to take up the role, and would work hard to enhance quality in teaching, research, services, and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who's also a molecular biologist, revealed he would meet with his team this week, and arrange meetings with staff, students and alumni later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo said he would strengthen exchanges with the governing council that was reformed two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of members were reduced from 55 to 34, while the ratio of external to internal members was changed to 2:1 from 1:1 in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think communication is very important. Therefore, our management team will have frequent and regular exchanges with the governing council," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that all of us know that both the management team and governing council want CUHK to be better, and to enhance CHUK's international status."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo noted that a documentary by the university's student publication on district-level care teams had caught the attention of society.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the publication offered a chance for students to obtain hands-on experience, adding it was also a learning opportunity for them given their story had generated so many different opinions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Succeeding Rocky Tuan, Lo's term will run for five years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a new and potentially more robust attempt to arrest him on insurrection charges after a top investigator vowed to do whatever it takes to break a security blockade and take in the impeached leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Protesters both supporting and opposing to the embattled Yoon continued to brave freezing temperatures to stage rallies on the streets around the presidential compound on Wednesday after a court re-issued a warrant to arrest Yoon a day earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Presidential Security Service (PSS) was seen this week fortifying the compound with barbed wire and barricades using buses to block access to the hillside villa where Yoon is believed to be, having defied summons to appear for questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is under criminal investigation for insurrection over his December 3 martial law bid that stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also involved in a separate Constitutional Court trial over his December 14 impeachment for violating his constitutional duties with the late-night martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oh Dong-woon, head of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials - which is leading the probe against Yoon - apologised on Tuesday for a failed arrest attempt last Friday after a tense six-hour stand-off inside the presidential compound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oh called off the arrest attempt after being blocked from entering the presidential compound by a human chain of hundreds of PSS members and military guards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll do our best to accomplish our goal by thoroughly preparing this time with great determination that the second warrant execution will be the last," Oh told a parliament committee. It was not immediately clear how long the new arrest warrant would last.(Reuters)

 Tech giant Meta's shock announcement that it is ending its US fact-checking program triggered scathing criticism on Tuesday from disinformation researchers who warned it risked opening the floodgates for false narratives.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was going to "get rid" of its third-party fact-checkers in the United States, in a sweeping policy shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever," said Ross Burley, co-founder of the non-profit Centre for Information Resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an alternative, Zuckerberg said Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, would use "Community Notes similar to X" in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Community Notes is a crowd-sourced moderation tool that X has promoted as the way for users to add context to posts, but researchers have repeatedly questioned its effectiveness in combating falsehoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's announcement was cheered by conservative supporters of US President-elect Donald Trump, who said the move had "probably" been in response to his threats against the company and Zuckerberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta began fact checks in December 2016, after Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that “fake news” was spreading on its platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years, the tech giant boasted it was working with more than 100 organisations in over 60 languages to combat misinformation. (Agencies)

    Govt urges changes to tap into silver economy

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk has called for changes to cater to the city's ageing population, saying the rising number of elderly individuals offers “tremendous" market potential.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk is leading a working group on promoting the silver economy to address the growing needs of the elderly population.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, the minister said Hong Kong could reference measures in other places, such as the mainland, Japan, and South Korea, to support those aged 65 and above.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged businesses to "find their niche" and tap into the potential that the silver economy offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seniors are a very huge market. For people selling goods or services, they must cater to their customers' preferences... If businesses want to sell products to the elderly, they must make changes," Cheuk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, there should naturally be a designated area for a silver economy, for people to find food, healthcare products, and things that are suitable for the elderly. This is bound to happen, so I'm not worried whether the industry would cooperate on this or not."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans for the silver economy with measures to boost consumption among the elderly, promote industrialisation of products, and encourage seniors to return to the labour force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 44 years after Jimmy Carter left the nation's capital in a humbling defeat, the 39th president returned to Washington for three days of state funeral rites, starting on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Carter’s body was transferred in a grand and solemn military ceremony to the US Capitol, where it will lie in state until a national funeral on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter, who died on December 29 at the age of 100, served a single term from 1977-1981 and was widely praised for his post-presidential humanitarian efforts, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having been flown to Washington aboard a presidential US Air Force jet, his flag-draped casket was carried atop a gun carriage in a funeral procession from the US Navy Memorial – an ode to his military service on submarines – to Capitol Hill, tracing the opposite route he took during his inauguration parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of US service members accompanied the procession down Pennsylvania Avenue, which was cleared of snow from a recent winter storm that has prompted federal office and school closures in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Military pallbearers then carried his casket up to the Capitol Rotunda where a short service was held, with Carter's family, members of Congress and other dignitaries including Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice President Kamala Harris in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter is the 13th former US president to lie in state in the Capitol. Abraham Lincoln, assassinated in 1865, was the first.
  <br>
  <br>
  A state funeral service is to be held Thursday at the National Cathedral, an Episcopal church in Washington that also hosted funerals for former presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George HW Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current President Joe Biden is to deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat. Biden has declared Thursday a national day of mourning, with federal government offices to be closed for the day. (Agencies)

    Wildfire forces evacuations in upscale Los Angeles

<img alt="Flames rise as the Palisades fire burns during a windstorm in west Los Angeles. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786570_1_20250108083830.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A wildfire raged across an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, sending large billows of smoke over much of the metropolitan area and causing traffic jams as people fled their homes under evacuation orders.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 510 hectares of the Pacific Palisades area between Santa Monica and Malibu had burned, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from dry, powerful winds. The size of the fire grew six-fold in a matter of hours on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 26,000 people in more than 10,000 households and more than 13,000 structures are under threat from the blaze, said Kristin Crowley, fire chief of the LA Fire Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  California Governor Gavin Newsom said many structures had already been destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He warned residents across Southern California not to assume they were out of danger, saying the worst of the winds were expected between 10 pm Tuesday and 5 am Wednesday, local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters predicted the windstorm would last for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills, including in areas that had not seen substantial rain in months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighbourhood was completely blocked. Ash fell around them while fires burned on both sides of the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,” Trainor said. “People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The erratic weather caused President Joe Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, California, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. Biden will deliver his remarks in Los Angeles instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon and MGM Studios cancelled a premiere of Jennifer Lopez’s new film “Unstoppable” due to the fires and high winds. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as traders digested economic data which lowered the likelihood of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Services sector and job openings data pointed to price pressures and a relatively robust labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the Fed's dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, Tuesday's data suggest there is no burning need to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have some relatively minor numbers today, but they pointed to things that are not at all Fed friendly: higher prices and a more robust labour economy," said Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones faired best of the three major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.4 percent at 42,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,909, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.9 percent to close at 19,489.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the stock markets fell, yields on US Treasurys rose, with the yield on the popular 10-year US Treasury rising by six basis points to around 4.7 percent on growing fears that President-elect Trump's threats to impose tariffs could prove inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 24 hours, futures traders have raised their expectations that the Fed will pause interest rate cuts at its next rate meeting this month, according to data from CME Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, chip titan Nvidia plunged 6.2 percent after chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote address at a tech conference failed to impress investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was good news for pharmaceutical giant Moderna, which jumped 11.7 percent as flu and Covid-19 cases continued to rise across the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are now looking ahead to the release of job data on Wednesday and Friday of this week, which will provide key information on the overall health of the labour market. (AFP)

    Newcastle beat Arsenal in League Cup semis first leg

<img alt="Alexander Isak opened the scoring for Newcastle during their English League Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786563_1_20250108071526.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle took a giant stride towards the League Cup final as goals from Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon earned a 2-0 semi-final, first leg lead at Arsenal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies have never previously won the competition and have had to wait since 1969 to celebrate any major trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Isak they have the form striker in England right now and he rifled home the opener then helped tee up the second for Gordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have a mountain to climb when the sides meet for the second leg on February 5 if they are to progress to meet either Tottenham or Liverpool in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of silverware to both clubs was reflected in the line-ups, as Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe named their strongest available teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has brought Arsenal back into contention for Premier League titles in recent seasons, but his only trophy in charge of the Gunners came five years ago by lifting the FA Cup in the early months of his reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were able to welcome back Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli from the side that started the 1-1 draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's lack of a lethal striker like Isak proved the difference between the sides. Arsenal had the majority of the ball and the chances but failed to make them count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinelli came closest when he raced onto Leandro Trossard's pass and smashed against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later came the sucker punch. Arsenal, so renowned for their own set-piece threat, allowed a long free-kick into their box to fall at the feet of Isak who fired in off the underside of the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede's 14th goal in his last 15 games took him to 50 in a Newcastle shirt – doing so in five fewer matches than it took the club's record goalscorer Alan Shearer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak had a major role to play in what could be a decisive second goal in the tie just after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Newcastle striker's quick feet allowed him to get a shot off that was parried by David Raya into the path of the onrushing Gordon to fire in the rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal should still have made their mammoth task for the return leg in Tyneside next month a more manageable one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz somehow miscued a header wide with the goal gaping to cut the arrears. Howe replaced Isak and Gordon as Newcastle were happy to just to protect their lead in a 5-5-0 formation for the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, though, lacked the guile to break them down without the injured Bukayo Saka to seemingly extend their wait for Arteta's revolution to deliver another trophy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Didier Deschamps, France's longest serving national team coach, will reportedly not seek to renew his contract which expires in 2026, according to the French Football Federation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deschamps' deal runs until after the next World Cup, for which Les Bleus have yet to qualify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old took over from fellow 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc in 2012 and led Les Bleus to the World Cup title in 2018, two years after reaching the European Championship final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former France captain, one of only three to win football's most prestigious prize as a player and a coach, guided the national team to the World Cup final again in 2022 – losing to Argentina on penalties after one of the best matches in the tournament's history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham have exercised the option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until June 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Son's deal, which he signed in 2021, was due to expire at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean, 32, joined the Premier League club in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen and has made 431 appearances, scoring 169 goals – fourth on Tottenham's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son was named club captain in August 2023, and shared the Premier League's Golden Boot with Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah in the 2021 to 2022 season after scoring 23 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also captain of South Korea, making 131 appearances to date and scoring 51 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the current season, he has scored seven goals in all competitions in a struggling Spurs side who are 12th in the Premier League table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham said the South Korea international had become a “global star” and a “modern-day great” in his time at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement of his extension came ahead of Tottenham's English League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool. (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Tuesday marked 10 years since an Islamist attack on the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper that shocked the country, and led to fierce debate about freedom of expression and religion.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo led commemorations by laying wreaths at the site of the weekly's former offices, which were stormed by two masked Al-Qaeda-linked gunmen with AK-47 assault rifles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron and Hidalgo also paid tribute to Ahmed Merabet, a Muslim police officer who was executed at point-blank range near the building in the Bastille area of the capital in one of the most shocking images recorded of the tragedy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twelve people died in the attacks, including eight editorial staff, while a separate but linked hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris by a third gunman on January 9, 2015, claimed another four lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloodshed signalled the start of a dark period for France during which extremists inspired by Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group repeatedly mounted attacks that set the country on edge and raised religious tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is not necessarily sad," Frederica Wolinksi, the daughter of famed French cartoonist and Charlie Hebdo contributor Georges Wolinski. "It's good that 10 years later we can still remember those who died on January 7 so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack on Charlie Hebdo, carried out in retaliation for the newspaper’s irreverent caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, ignited fierce global debates about the limits of free expression.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the days that followed, millions marched in solidarity, brandishing pens and signs declaring, “Je Suis Charlie” (I am Charlie).
  <br>
  <br>
  But 10 years on, the unity of that moment has given way to deeper divisions. Charlie Hebdo said its research shows that while a majority of French still believe in the fundamental right to caricature, younger generations increasingly criticise satire they see as divisive or insensitive, particularly toward marginalised communities.

 The number of dead in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China has risen to at least 126.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tremor also left 188 others injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raised the earthquake emergency response to the highest level, the region's emergency command centre announced on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck at 9.05am, and the epicentre was in Tsogo Township of Dingri County.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 houses were damaged in the strongest tremor to hit Dingri in five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led a team to the quake site, and thousands of rescuers and medical workers have been sent to the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in northeastern Nepal also felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee said the Hong Kong government will maintain close contact with relief organisations and provide assistance through its Disaster Relief Fund to those affected in Tibet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed deep condolences to the victims and their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities have not received any requests for assistance from Hong Kong residents so far. (Additional reporting by Xinhua, agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank said on Tuesday it is making good progress in recruiting donors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank's director, Rosanna Wong, said it has received more than 100 calls from potential donors since the launch of the facility's website in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the opening of our website, we have actually received a lot of phone calls. More than 100 potential moms have already contacted us. So after today, we are going to contact them, actively support them, hopefully they could be donors at the end," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility, located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital, started operation on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to collect 1,000 litres of milk a year, which Wong said would require 150 to 200 donors, each contributing at least 5 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the annual target is met, it can be supplied to 450 to 600 premature babies born before 32 weeks, or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A donor, Yoyo Chan, who has an eight-month-old daughter, said she wants to help other premature babies after two previous miscarriages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I know that there's a breast milk bank, I decided to do it because I want to bless and contribute to the premature babies. At least I can do something to help them," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The facility's advanced practice nurse Christine Lam said a face-to-face interview will be conducted with prospective donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  To qualify as donors, the mothers must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and are currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also have to take a blood test once every three months, and to inform staff of the facility whether they are taking medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The milk bank will offer milk bottles and pouches to donors and arrange couriers to collect their milk.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,600 global finance and business figures will attend the annual Asian Financial Forum (AFF) which is set to kick off in Hong Kong next Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee; Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank; and Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on artificial intelligence will be among the speakers for the event, touching on the shifting global economic landscape and its impact on mainland China, as well as the development and governance of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 18th edition of the forum is "Powering the Next Growth Engine".
  <br>
  <br>
  While AI is expected to be a key focus, Patrick Lau, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council, told RTHK that the event will also explore other fields that are considered as new drivers for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing family offices and wealth management, together with philanthropy, as another area of high growth, especially leveraging in Hong Kong's strength as an international financial centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green and sustainability will continue to be very important going forward. Last but not least, we have many new friends in Asean and the Middle East, so Islamic finance is another big area [in focus] for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the SAR's financial markets have undergone a series of reforms, including a road map on sustainability disclosure and a policy statement on responsible application of AI in the financial markets, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the forum will showcase the SAR's latest financial advantages while exploring new collaborations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luanne Lim, chairwoman of the AFF Steering Committee and Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of HSBC, said despite greater uncertainties this year with increased tariff risks, Asia will continue to be the global growth engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The region's gross domestic product is expected to grow 4.4 percent this year, outpacing the 2.7 percent global average target.

 A South Korean court has re-issued a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, the country's corruption investigation agency said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investigators seeking to question him on allegations of insurrection have struggled to execute a warrant for his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the investigation unit, blocked by a human chain of hundreds of presidential security service and military guards outside his residence last week, said earlier on Tuesday they remained determined to bring him in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers filed an injunction request to a Seoul court to nullify the arrest warrant, but the court struck that down on Sunday, a court official said on Tuesday. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 This year's Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition will highlight a roster of young players from the SAR, as Hong Kong, China aim to nurture a new generation of talent for international play.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of the tournament will take place at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangdong on January 15, while the SAR will host the return leg at Hong Kong Stadium on January 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darren Arnott, head coach of the youth divisions, will be leading the Hong Kong, China team of 37 players, with 29 of them under the age of 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), said on Tuesday that the experience will be crucial in encouraging young players to take on a key role in football development in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the main initiatives of the HKFA is to develop more young players and give them more opportunities to play and train. So under this strategy, we have a number of initiatives," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that at the last Asian Games at Hangzhou, it was mainly comprised of the youth team U-23. We had a historic result in the Asian Games, which showed that Hong Kong has a bright future and we have many good quality youth players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said the association has established a league for younger players and set up a training base in Guangxi to provide players with better facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong Stadium will host the second leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK will broadcast both matches live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that the HKFA is in discussions with Kai Tak Sports Park about the possibility of hosting the home games for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, starting with the match against India in June.

    Govt to put up Tung Chung residential site for tender

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday said she is reasonably optimistic that a residential site put up for tender this quarter will be successful, adding it is too early to predict whether the annual land sales income target can be met.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parcel earmarked for sale in Tung Chung, which will provide around 745 flats, was first put up for tender in September 2023 but was unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Announcing the last land sale programme for the 2024/25 fiscal year, Linn said the government had been listening to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard views from the real estate industry, suggesting that the government should roll out simpler, smaller-sized [plots] with fewer requirements on site formation and government facilities," Linn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The tender] is in line with such market expectations as it attaches very simple tender conditions and no requirement to construct government facilities. Moreover, as the site sits on reclaimed land, the development is not required to conduct any further site formation works, which may help reduce the development cost."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the parcel was originally not part of the land sale programme for this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if she was confident the annual land sales revenue target of HK$33 billion could be met, Linn said it was still too early to make a conclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development chief said the administration had been listening to developers about the type of site that was in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain pragmatic and prudent in selecting the kind of land that we would like to roll out. When we know that the appetite of the market is for smaller sites, simpler sites, we are exactly moving along that direction, and that would help enliven the market and rekindle their interest in coming forward to bid for sites," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking into account various land sources, Linn said the land supply for the fourth quarter can provide around 1,100 new private residential units.

 China said it attaches "great importance" to remarks by US President-elect Donald Trump on developing bilateral ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of Sino-US economic and trade relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said in a media briefing on Tuesday, citing mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday said he and President Xi Jinping have been speaking through representatives, and that he believes the two leaders will get along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've already been talking. We've been talking through their representatives," Trump said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think we will probably get very well, I predict," he said. "But you know, it's got to be a two-way street."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo did not confirm that any exchanges had been made through the leaders' aides, but said the two countries have maintained communications through various means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks via video link with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, with both sides agreeing to maintain communication, manage differences and continue stabilisation of economic relations during the political transition period in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the video call was candid, in-depth and constructive, and both nations agreed on the importance of maintaining communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua added that the Chinese side expressed concern over US economic and trade restrictions on China, in particular clarifying Beijing's position concerning the recent trade investigation initiated by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yellen, meanwhile, raised concerns about "malicious cyber activity" by Chinese state-sponsored actors, according to a statement by the US Treasury Department. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Various local attractions such as the giant panda will feature prominently in the upcoming Lunar New Year parade.
 <br>
  <br>
  The parade will be held on the evening of January 29, the first day of the Year of the Snake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and sponsored by Cathay Pacific, it will feature nine floats and 46 performing groups from 14 countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many floats will even act as Hong Kong tourism ambassadors, featuring authentic elements of the city, such as the giant pandas. They will make an impressive appearance together with local famous food, such as milk tea,” Tourism Board chairman Pang Yiu-kai told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The K-pop girl group Kep1er and Thai boy band LYKN are among those invited to perform at the parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay’s chief executive officer Ronald Lam said the city's flagship carrier is committed to promoting mega events in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This parade is a platform for international cultural exchange. We have groups from different countries, gathering here and performing for local people and tourists, allowing everyone to experience the festive atmosphere with the characteristics of Hong Kong,” Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The parade will start at 8pm at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, proceeding along Canton Road, Haiphong Road and Nathan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets will be on sale from January 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board said the parade will kick off a series of festive celebrations across Hong Kong, including a fireworks display on January 30, Lunar New Year horse racing on January 31 and the Chinese New Year Cup football match on February 1.

    US-Japan ties rock solid: Blinken

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted during a visit to Tokyo on Tuesday that ties with Japan were stronger than ever, days after President Joe Biden blocked Nippon Steel's takeover of US Steel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Business groups say the decision could have a chilling effect on Japan's standing as the biggest foreign investor in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  With two weeks left before president-elect Donald Trump takes over and Blinken is slated to be replaced by Marco Rubio, the top US diplomat noted that he also came to Japan on his first trip in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visits show "not just the importance, the centrality, the United States attaches to our alliance", Blinken said as he met Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This allyship, I believe, it's actually stronger than it's ever been," Blinken said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pointing to the need to coordinate after North Korea's launch of a missile Monday -- while he was in South Korea -- Blinken said: "Even though we're in a political transition, the world doesn't stop."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken also cited the strength of economic ties but made no direct mention of Biden's decision last week to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9-billion takeover of long-struggling US Steel, citing national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the two companies filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Biden administration's "illegal interference" in the transaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're certain the lawsuit will reveal a set of facts that clearly violate the constitution and the law, so I believe we have a chance of winning," Nippon Steel chair Eiji Hashimoto said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, "wants to make manufacturing strong again, and once again enrich the lives and future of manufacturing workers", Hashimoto added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is exactly in line with what we're doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had touted the takeover as a lifeline for a US company long past its heyday but opponents warned the Japanese owners would slash jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden had criticised the deal for months, while holding off on a move that could hurt ties with Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors, with Japanese firms investing almost US$800 billion in the United States in 2023. (AFP)

    Indonesia celebrates its entry into Brics bloc

<img alt="Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (left) with Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto. Brazil was instrumental in helping Indonesia join Brics. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786446_1_20250107132319.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia welcomed on Tuesday Brazil's announcement that it had become a full member of the Brics group of nations, a bloc of developing economies increasingly seen as a counterweight to the West.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that Southeast Asia's most populous country "shares with the other members the will to reform the institutions of global governance and contribute positively to cooperation within the Global South".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, which holds the rotating presidency of the grouping in 2025, said Indonesia's bid to join the bloc had been approved during a summit in 2023 in Johannesburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia in turn said it "welcomes" the announcement of its inclusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This achievement shows Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues and commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation to create a global structure that is more inclusive and fair," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brics was created in 2009 by founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa joined the following year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc was expanded again last year with Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates becoming full members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia sees its Brics membership as "a strategic step to improve the collaborations and cooperation with other developing nations, based on the principle of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development", the Jakarta statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also expressed Indonesia's "gratitude to Russia", the 2024 Brics chair, "for its support and leadership in facilitating Indonesia's joining", as well as to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  During its presidency, Brazil aims to boost cooperation between countries of the "Global South" and reform multilateral institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the objectives, according to the government of left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is the "development of means of payment" to facilitate trade between member countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the last Brics summit in Kazan, Russia, in November 2024, member nations discussed boosting non-dollar transactions and strengthening local currencies. (Reuters)

    'Putting Tencent, CATL on US list is suppression'

<img alt="The US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery maker CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786435_1_20250107115416.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of "unjustified suppression" after the US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery manufacturer CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is always firmly opposed to the US side's generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the curbing of China's high-quality development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrong practices," Guo said, adding China would "take the necessary measures to resolutely protect the rights of Chinese companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless, drone maker Autel Robotics, and China's largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, according to a document published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two entities owned by Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation were also listed, CNOOC China Ltd and CNOOC International Trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under US law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to US entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could also add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent fell as much as seven percent in early trade on Tuesday, while the US-traded shares of the company, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell eight percent in over-the-counter trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker whose Shenzhen-listed shares dropped more than five percent, also called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military-related activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error." Quectel's shares fell nearly seven percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cosco's HK-listed shares dropped more than four percent. (Agencies)

    Scores killed after powerful quake hits Tibet region

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has ordered all out rescue efforts after at least 95 people were killed and another 130 injured when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The epicentre was about 75 kilometres northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border with Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath work effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate emergency rescue supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all," Xi said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average altitude in the area around the epicentre is about 4,200 metres, the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post.
  <br>
  <br>
  State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within five kilometres of the epicentre, which was 380 kilometres from Lhasa, the provincial capital, and about 23 kilometres from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, also known as Xigaze in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 230 kilometres away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also reports of tremors in the northern Indian state of Bihar, which borders Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the quake damaged or destroyed buildings in the autonomous region.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the China Earthquake Networks Centre, the quake occurred at 9.05am local time in Xigaze, at a depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It revised the strength of the tremor from its earlier reading of 6.9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey, meanwhile, reported the tremor as magnitude 7.1.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 10am, multiple aftershocks had been recorded, with the largest one measuring 4.4 in magnitude, according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos went viral on Chinese social media platforms, showing crumbled houses amid the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council Earthquake Relief Headquarters Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched a level 3 emergency response to the quake, while the local government dispatched over 1,500 people to conduct search and rescue work in the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South-western parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2008, a huge quake in Sichuan province killed almost 70,000 people, while a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in 2015 leaving about 9,000 people dead in Nepal's worst ever earthquake. (Reporting by Xinhua, Reuters and Associated Press)

    Govt enhances New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said its enhancement measures to the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will attract more people, as well as promote the development of family offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  Starting in March, applicants will only need to prove they have a minimum net worth of HK$30 million in the six months before applying, rather than the original period of two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also consider the total amount of net assets that applicants are absolutely beneficially entitled to within their family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the scheme, applicants must invest a minimum of HK$30 million within the six-month time limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also recognise investments made by private enterprises that are wholly owned by applicants as eligible investment, but the companies must be incorporated or registered in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe these measures will encourage more investors to join the scheme and can create synergy with the tax concession regime for family offices, thereby promoting the development of family office businesses in Hong Kong," the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are committed to providing comprehensive support for family office decision-makers to establish themselves in Hong Kong, further attracting global asset owners and reinforcing Hong Kong's leading position as an international asset and wealth management hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 800 applications have been received since the scheme was implemented last March, and the government expects over HK$24 billion of investment will be brought into the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpha Lau, Director-General of Investment Promotion, pointed out that the number of applications in the first 10 months since the implementation has surpassed the same period under the previous Capital Investment Entrant Scheme that was launched in 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I trust that these measures will enhance the attractiveness of the scheme. We will continue to work closely with professionals and service providers to further promote the scheme to high-net-worth families around the globe," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong was confident the new measures would attract more wealthy people to Hong Kong.

  “I hope that Hong Kong would attract more than 5,000 applications, bring in more than HK$150 billion of investment, set up more and more companies or family offices here,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The investors from all over the world, who expect Hong Kong's advantages, for example, safety, low tax, and [connectivity] to the mainland market - those investors will get benefits in the near future.”
  <br>
  <br>
  But the founder of the Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association added the scheme had room to grow in terms of attracting more applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There's room for improvement. For example, HK$24 billion is a lot of money, but I noticed that this is only a forecast number. We hope the government help these investors complete their investments as soon as possible. We know there is still a long way to go from waiting for investment to completing the investment. I think 800 applications is not ideal,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shang said the government should provide more assistance to help investors settle in the SAR and expand into the mainland.

    Singapore, Malaysia agree deal on joint SEZ

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia and Singapore announced on Tuesday an agreement on a special economic zone (SEZ) in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, aiming to support investment and free up movement of goods and people between the countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Southeast Asian neighbours first agreed in principle to jointly develop the SEZ a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's agreement was announced during a visit to Malaysia by Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and senior cabinet ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an important project ... we can both be more competitive, enhance our value proposition, and jointly attract more investments to our shores," Wong told a joint press conference with Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When negotiating the agreement, both sides have actively engaged stakeholders to ensure that the SEZ has the conditions to help our businesses grow together for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar said the SEZ was unique initiative as it was rare for two countries to team up on a single project.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two countries are aiming to attract high-value investments into Johor in sectors ranging from manufacturing and logistics to tourism and energy transition, Malaysia's Economic Minister Rafizi Ramli told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are targeting 50 projects at the economic zone within the first five years of its inception, and the creation of 20,000 skilled jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaysia will set up and manage an infrastructure fund to support companies looking to set up there, while Singapore will create its own fund to facilitate investments and support Singaporean companies operating in Johor, Rafizi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Malaysians commute every day to Singapore for work and study, causing frequent traffic congestion on the causeway between the countries, one of the world's busiest border crossings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders also invited proposals for high-speed rail between the two countries, which Anwar said should be led by the private sector, with limited government involvement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they are investigating a fatal traffic accident in Tai Po on Monday, in which a pedestrian was killed.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 6pm, a coach was travelling along Kwong Wang Street towards Kwong Fuk Estate, when it reportedly hit a 65-year-old man while approaching a bus stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pedestrian sustained chest injuries and was sent to Prince of Wales Hospital in a conscious state, but was certified dead at about 7.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the force of the impact caused the man to knock over another pedestrian - a 67-year-old woman - who sustained limb injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in a conscious state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 66-year-old coach driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and remains in custody.

    US records its first human death from bird flu

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Louisiana health authorities on Monday reported the first human death in the United States linked to bird flu, while noting the patient had underlying medical conditions and that general risks to the public remained "low".
 <br>
  <br>
  The patient, aged over 65, had been hospitalised in the southern state since at least mid-December, when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it as the country's first serious case of human infection from the H5N1 virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk," the Louisiana Department of Health said in a statement announcing the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the patient had "contracted H5N1 after exposure to a combination of a non-commercial backyard flock and wild birds," but had detected no further H5N1 infections nor evidence of person-to-person transmission in the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news comes just days after the federal government awarded an additional US$306 million to bolster H5N1 surveillance programs and research, amid some criticism for President Joe Biden's administration over its response to the simmering issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists over concerns it could mutate into a more transmissible form – potentially triggering a deadly pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the beginning the 2024, the CDC has recorded 66 cases of bird flu in humans in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of data that shows that this virus can be lethal, more lethal than many viruses we worry about," Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For that reason, people have been quite alarmed about these outbreaks that have been occurring on farms and other places in the US and have really been shouting for the US government to do more," she added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean anti-graft investigators were waiting on Tuesday for a new court-ordered arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose failed martial law bid threw the country into turmoil.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former star prosecutor has refused questioning three times over a bungled martial law decree last month and is holed up in his residence surrounded by hundreds of guards preventing his arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is likely a new warrant will be granted by the same court that issued the first order, which expired after seven days, but investigators refused to disclose the duration of the new warrant they were seeking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters today refiled a warrant with the Seoul Western District Court to extend the arrest warrant for defendant Yoon," the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) said in a statement late on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Details regarding the validity period cannot be disclosed."
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no comment by investigators or the Seoul court on the new warrant being approved by Tuesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, CIO deputy director Lee Jae-seung told reporters on Tuesday before it was refiled that the likelihood the court would not grant an extension was "very low".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated on charges of insurrection and, if formally arrested and convicted, faces prison or, at worst, the death penalty. His failed martial law decree plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would also become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers repeatedly said the initial warrant was "unlawful" and "illegal", pledging to take further legal action against it. (AFP)

    Polar vortex keeps much of the US in icy grip

<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge swathe of the US was blasted with ice, snow and wind on Monday as the polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The immense storm system brought disruption to areas of the country that usually escape winter's wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington DC received heavy snow as President-elect Donald Trump’s victory was certified. Taking advantage of the rare snowstorm in the nation’s capital, revellers engaged in a snowball fight in front of the Washington Monument as flags flew at half-staff in memory of former President Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges southward into the US, Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  School closings were widespread, with districts in Indiana, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas cancelling or delaying the start of classes on Monday. Classes were also cancelled in Maryland, where Governor Wes Moore declared a state of emergency on Sunday and announced that state government offices would also be closed the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2,500 flights were cancelled and at least 6,500 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday morning, according to tracking platform FlightAware. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015-2016 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths," he added. "It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better. It is well and truly too early to talk about a title challenge, we are not thinking about that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels, but the chances dried up for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed-up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse. (Reuters)

    US Congress certifies Trump election victory

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory on Monday during a session presided over by Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the November contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quadrennial ritual, clearing the way for Trump's inauguration in two weeks, went smoothly - in sharp contrast to four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harboured similar concerns until his November 5 defeat of Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris oversaw the roll call of the states in the vice president's ceremonial role as president of the Senate.

  "Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social earlier on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint session of Congress proceeded despite a winter storm that dropped about 15 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans also captured a majority in the US Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats did not try to block certification of Trump's victory on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump's swearing-in on January 20. (Reuters)

 Tech sector gains helped US indexes recoup some holiday-season losses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 32.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,975.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 42,706.56, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 243.30, or 1.2 percent, to 19,864.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies were the clear leaders, including those with A-I exposure. Nvidia climbed 3.4 percent to top its record set in November ahead of a speech by CEO Jensen Huang at the annual CES convention in Las Vegas after trading ended for the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing despite criticism that they're overbought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith said on late Friday the company is on track to invest about US$80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centres to train AI models this fiscal year. Smith said AI is the biggest opportunity “to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy” since the invention of electricity. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uber Technologies rose 2.7 percent higher after the ride-hailing app said it would accelerate US$1.5 billion in purchases of its own stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Steel climbed 8.1 percent after it and Japan’s Nippon Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. (AP)

    Canada PM Trudeau announces resignation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberals after nine years in office but will stay on in his post until the party chooses a replacement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, under heavy pressure from Liberal legislators to quit amid polls showing the party will be crushed at the next election, said at a news conference that parliament would be suspended until March 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means Trudeau will still be prime minister on January 20 when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs that would cripple Canada's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I intend to resign as party leader as prime minister after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide competitive process," Trudeau said. "This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 and won re-election twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his popularity started dipping two years ago amid public anger over high prices and a housing shortage, and his fortunes never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament was due to resume on January 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down the government as soon as they could, most likely at the end of March. But if parliament does not return until March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calls for him to step aside have soared since last month, when he tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of "political gimmicks" rather than focusing on what was best for the country. (Reuters)

    UK PM Starmer defends record as public prosecutor

<img alt="Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer answers a question from the media during a visit to the Elective Orthopaedic Centre at Epsom Hospital. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786370_1_20250106223004.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended his work as Britain's top prosecutor on Monday, refusing to mention US billionaire Elon Musk by name but addressing his criticism that, long before he became leader, he had failed to prosecute gangs who sexually abused girls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk, a close ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, has spent days posting messages on his social media site X accusing Starmer of what he said was a failure to prosecute gangs of men, mostly of a South Asian background, who raped young girls when he was director of public prosecutions (DPP) between 2008 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer declined to address some of Musk's other messages on X - including a poll asking whether the United States should liberate the UK from its "tyrannical government" - but strongly defended his record as DPP, saying he had overcome resistance to tackling the allegations by reopening cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was chief prosecutor for five years, I tackled that head-on ... and that's why I reopened cases that had been closed and supposedly finished. I brought the first major prosecution of an Asian grooming gang ... I changed the whole prosecution approach," he told a press conference, visibly angry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they are interested in themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer has refrained from commenting on Musk's increasingly critical comments of his tenure, but his impatience was clear when he tackled the allegations over cases involving gangs who systematically groomed and raped girls over a period of years, some of which coincided with his time as DPP.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Monday said it had approved the conversion of two red minibus routes into the more regulated green minibus routes, under its conversion scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  The routes are from Hiu Kwong Street in Sau Mau Ping to Pak Hoi Street in Jordan; and a circular route running between Park Yoho in Yuen Long and Yuen Long Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Services are expected to begin in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Transport Department said the two operators have started the preparation work, including drawing up the service schedules, buying stop signs, repainting the minibus bodies, as well as recruiting drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added it has been the government’s established policy to encourage the conversion of red minibus routes for more effective monitoring and better service quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Transport Department will consider the way forward of the Scheme, taking into account the implementation of these routes in the first batch of the Scheme as well as the views and feedback from the trades,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department had previously invited the operators of 11 selected red minibus routes to convert into green minibus routes, but only received two applications.

    Nippon, US Steel file lawsuit after Biden blocks sale

<img alt="US and Nippon Steel are mounting a legal challenge against President Joe Biden's decision to block the deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786361_1_20250106211435.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nippon Steel and US Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based American steel maker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit, filed on Monday in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the outset of the process, both Nippon Steel and US Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security, including by revitalising communities that rely on American steel, bolstering the American steel supply chain, and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry," the companies said in a prepared statement Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had promised to invest US$2.7 billion in US Steel’s ageing blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting US government approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While administration officials have said the decision was unrelated to Japan's relationship with the US — this is the first time a US president has blocked a merger between a US and Japanese firm. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said an off-duty customs officer was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a vehicle last Friday, when a motorcyclist died in a traffic accident in Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said a 40-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle on the day of the fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were still investigating and would seek advice from the Department of Justice. The arrested man has been released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said it would not comment on the case as it is still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident happened at around 5.46pm last Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the deceased 27-year-old man was riding his motorcycle along Wang Kee Street towards Lam Hing Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  He reportedly lost control of his vehicle and rammed into a roadside iron pole near Central Mail Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The motorcyclist, who had sustained serious injuries, was declared dead at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said a 40-year-old male passerby was knocked down by the motorcycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  He sustained injuries to his hand and was sent to United Christian Hospital for treatment.

    Jailed ex-Malaysian PM Najib closer to house arrest

<img alt="Malaysia's appeals court on Monday granted a bid by jailed ex-premier Najib Razak to see a document he said should allow him to serve his sentence at home. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786331_1_20250106172957.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on January 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are happy that finally Najib has got a win,” his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. “He is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognised some element of injustice that has been placed against him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it was “criminal” for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan’s order “in bad faith.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib’s hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on January 30 last year under Malaysia’s unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib’s application have not made any public comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on August 23, 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pardons board didn’t give any reason for its decision and wasn’t required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators allege at least US$4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib’s associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewellery.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$700 million landed in Najib’s bank accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Najib is still fighting graft charges in the main trial linking him directly to the scandal. (AP)
