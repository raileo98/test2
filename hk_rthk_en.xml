    Thai police station comes under siege ...from monkeys

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in central Thailand said they barricaded themselves into their own station over the weekend, after a menacing mob of 200 escaped monkeys ran riot.
 <br>
  <br>
  The human inhabitants of Lopburi have long suffered from a growing and aggressive monkey population and authorities have built special enclosures to contain groups of the unruly residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday around 200 of the primates broke out and rampaged through town, with one posse descending on a local police station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to make sure doors and windows are closed to prevent them from entering the building for food," police captain Somchai Seedee said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was concerned the marauders could destroy property including police documents, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic cops and officers on guard duty were called in to fend off the visitors, the Lopburi police said on Facebook on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around a dozen of the intruders were still perched on the roof of the police station on Monday, photos from local media showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down in the streets, police and local authorities were working to round up individuals, luring them away from residential areas with food.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Thailand is an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, it has long assimilated Hindu traditions and lore from its pre-Buddhist era.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, monkeys are afforded a special place in Thai hearts thanks to the heroic Hindu monkey god Hanuman, who helped Rama rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of an evil demon king.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the primates rule the streets around the Pra Prang Sam Yod temple in the centre of Lopburi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The town has been laying on an annual feast of fruit for its population of macaques since the late 1980s, part religious tradition and part tourist attraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their growing numbers, property damage and fights have made for an uneasy coexistence with their human neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopburi authorities have tried quelling instances of human-macaque clashes with sterilisation and relocation programs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spirit Airlines said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection, after the pioneer of no-frills travel in the US struggled with a long run of quarterly losses, failed merger attempts and looming debt maturities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, had been losing money despite strong travel demand as it struggled with higher operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's troubles deepened after the collapse of its US$3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that grounded many of its aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline listed its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of US$1 billion to US$10 billion each, according to a court filing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline, as part of the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has received commitment for a US$350 million equity investment from existing bondholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Existing bondholders will also provide US$300 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which, together with available cash, is expected to support the airline through the Chapter 11 process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it expected to continue its flight operations through the proceedings and customers can book and fly without interruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the near term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it expected to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's shares, halted for trading on Monday, have plunged more than 90 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company started out as a long-haul trucking company in 1964 before shifting to aviation around 1983. It offered leisure packages to popular destinations under the name Charter One Airlines and rebranded to Spirit in 1992. (Reuters/AP)

<img alt="Alan Jones has been charged with a total of 26 offences against nine alleged victims. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779755_1_20241118221129.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been hit with two additional charges, after being arrested on Monday for a string of alleged historical sex crimes.
 <br>
  <br>
  A NSW police spokesman said the veteran broadcaster was charged with an additional two counts of indecent assault relating to a ninth victim, bringing the total to 26 charges, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault against people that had been employed by Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 83-year-old is a household name across Australia and for years held immense sway through his top-rating radio talk show.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a colourful career, he also coached the national men's rugby team, was a speechwriter for an Australian prime minister, and taught at one of the country's most prestigious schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detectives from a dedicated child abuse squad arrested Jones on Monday while executing a search warrant at his luxury Sydney Harbour apartment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was later released on bail ahead of a court appearance in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones has strenuously denied prior allegations of indecent assault which surfaced in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper late last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will allege that the accused knew some of them personally. Some of them professionally," state crime commander Michael Fitzgerald told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was 17 years old at the time of the alleged offending, Fitzgerald said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. They are fully aware, as are the investigators, that the hard work is just beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Whether as a sports coach, aspiring politician or radio heavyweight, Jones has spent decades in the public eye.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rose to fame while coaching the Australian rugby side in the 1980s, leading the Wallabies to a rare "grand slam" over England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  His feats as a coach and administrator earned him a place in Australia's sports hall of fame, where he was inducted in 1989. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Tuesday said the T1 signal will remain in force until at least 10pm.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi had continued to weaken, and was closest to the SAR, skirting within about 400 kilometres of the city. It issued the T1 on Monday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, coastal water levels would will be higher than normal between 10 pm and midnight on Tuesday, and warned of possible minor flooding in some low-lying coastal areas, and urged the public to take care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be swells," it added. "Members of the public should stay away from the shoreline and not engage in water sports."

<img alt="Swiatek rallied from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779794_1_20241119081949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy reached a second consecutive Billie Jean King Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland on Monday in Malaga.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Swiatek came from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles rubber but the Italian earned immediate revenge over the five-time Grand Slam winner in the deciding doubles clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini and veteran Sara Errani overcame Swiatek and Katarzyna Kawa 7-5, 7-5 in the doubles rubber to send the four-time champions through to Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening singles rubber, Italy's Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Magda Linette in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed by Swiatek's three-set battle with Paolini which ran over two-and-a-half hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough today – the intensity was insane, I was a little bit tired but I said to myself, you still have to play the doubles, you have to give everything for Italy, for my team," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I lost the singles match I was a little bit sad, but then tried to go in the locker room and think positive about the doubles," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linette, world number 38, was largely outclassed by Bronzetti, ranked 78th, in the first singles rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 4-1 down in the second set, Linette battled back strongly to force a tie-break but was eventually beaten when she slapped a return into the net after saving one match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  It left the pressure on Swiatek to deliver, which she did in thrilling fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten every time in their three prior clashes and having never managed to take a set off Swiatek, Paolini battled with fierce determination from the outset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek crushed the world number four in straight sets in the French Open final earlier this year but found a vastly tougher opponent in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole saved two break points to hold at 2-2 and then broke with a fizzing forehand to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not deter Paolini, who doubled down and won the next four games, securing two breaks of her own, to claim the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek spurned three break points in the final game and showed signs of tiredness after helping Poland reach the semi-finals by winning both her singles match and a doubles rubber against the Czech Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini had done the same for last year's runners-up Italy against Japan but dug deep to keep Swiatek at bay until the 10th and final game of the second set, which the Pole won to force a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the players exchanged breaks in the decider, Swiatek eventually triumphed when Paolini went long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 13 of the 16 break points she faced, proving the stronger in the key moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it was tough, my energy level was down in the second set but I managed to get back and that was the most important thing," said Swiatek, explaining she had "no time to celebrate" as the job was not done yet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryan Zaragoza won and converted a late penalty to help Euro 2024 winners Spain beat Switzerland 3-2 in a Uefa Nations League dead rubber on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nations League holders, already guaranteed top spot in Group A4, twice took the lead but were pegged back by the already-relegated Swiss in Tenerife.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first Spain match on the island in 28 years and fans were able to celebrate a win after Bayern Munich winger Zaragoza's late spot-kick settled the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Luis de la Fuente changed his whole line-up from the win over Denmark on Friday, handing Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aitor Paredes his debut in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeremi Pino, a Canary Islander, sent Spain ahead on home territory after 32 minutes after Pedri's penalty was saved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Alvaro Morata won the penalty and handed Pedri, born in Tenerife, the ball to take the spot kick, but Yvon Mvogo saved the Barcelona midfielder's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here at home with a goal, the win – I can't ask for more," Pino said. "It was a very special game – full marks to the fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente sent on another Spain debutant at half-time in Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joel Monteiro levelled for Switzerland but a few minutes later Bryan Gil stole the ball back to restore Spain's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andi Zeqiri fired home from the spot after a foul by Fabian Ruiz in the 85th minute but Zaragoza ensured Spain could finish a spectacular year on a high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, on loan at Osasuna from Bayern, burst into the box and was brought crashing down by Vincent Sierro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaragoza clinically dispatched the resulting penalty to spark jubilant celebrations in Tenerife. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed mixed on Monday, with traders bracing for Nvidia earnings later this week, and piling into Tesla on reports that President-elect Donald Trump could ease regulation on self-driving vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent to 43,389.60, while the S&P 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,893.62.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 18,791.81, buoyed by a jump in the share price of electric vehicle maker Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's share price jumped 5.6 percent following a Bloomberg News report over the weekend that Trump is looking to ease the restrictions on self-driving cars, which could benefit Tesla -- which is run by Trump-backer Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But elsewhere, it was "a relatively unremarkable day, in terms of magnitude of move," said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management, adding that this wasn't surprising, citing the post-election market "explosion," and the subsequent drawback last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kind of entered the new week at a midpoint with very little economic data," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are also looking ahead to earnings from chip designing titan Nvidia after markets close on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Monday accused US President Joe Biden of escalating the war in Ukraine over reports that he has allowed Kyiv to use long-range missiles supplied by Washington to strike targets inside Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments from Moscow came as Ukraine said a fresh Russian strike on the Black Sea port city of Odesa had killed at least eight people and wounded 18, following a massive weekend attack on the country's creaking energy infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has long sought authorisation from Washington to use the powerful Army Tactical Missile System, known by its initials as ATACMS, to hit military installations – and in particular airfields – inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine says it is mainly seeking to use the weapons to prevent Russian aerial bombardments that have levelled entire districts and towns near the front line and decimated energy facilities across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US official spoke about the policy shift on condition of anonymity on Sunday, saying the decision had come in response to Russia's deployment of thousands of North Korean troops to aid its war effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoke a further escalation of tensions," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If such a decision was really formulated and announced to the Kyiv regime, then of course it's a qualitatively new spiral of tensions and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the US's engagement in the conflict," Peskov added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said President Vladimir Putin had expressed Russia's position clearly in September when the leader said that such a move would put Nato "at war" with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin said in September that if Ukraine were to attack Russia with the long-range missiles then Moscow would "take the appropriate decisions based on the threats". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said three franchised bus operators have asked for fare hikes of between 6.5 and 9.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In documents submitted to the legislature, the Transport and Logistics Bureau said KMB and New Lantao Bus are seeking hikes of 6.5 percent, while CityBus wants a 9.5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies made the applications for higher fares earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the bus operators have averaged around 3.7 million passenger trips a day in the first half of this year, about 90 to 95 percent of what they were before the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the government has been helping the firms boost income and cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, with rising salary expenses and volatile fuel costs, as well as continued competition for passengers with other transport modes, the financial situation of franchised bus operators has not been satisfactory," the bureau said in the document.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said it will strike a balance between the public's affordability and financial sustainability of the operators when considering the applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the bus firms raised fares from between a little less than 4 percent and 7 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

    Bentancur gets seven-game ban over alleged racial slur

<img alt="Rodrigo Bentancur has since apologised to South Korean teammate Son Heung-min. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779739_1_20241118195332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur was on Monday given a seven-match domestic ban by the Football Association over an alleged racist remark made about teammate Son Heung-min in a TV interview.
 <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was charged by the FA in September in connection with an alleged breach of its rules during the interview in his home country of Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Juventus player, who has also been fined £100,000 (US$126,000), had been asked in June by a presenter for a Spurs player's shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replied: "Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur, 27, apologised to the South Korea international but because it was deemed an "aggravated breach," an independent regulatory commission panel was required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel upheld the charge and Bentancur will have to sit out Tottenham's next seven domestic fixtures, though he will be able to play in Europa League matches against Roma and Rangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA said in a statement that it was alleged that the incident constituted an "aggravated breach... as it included a reference – whether express or implied – to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rodrigo Bentancur denied this charge, but the independent regulatory commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son, speaking in late September, said: "He apologised straight afterwards when we had holiday. I was at home. I didn't even realise what was going on. He sent me a long message and you could feel it was coming from his heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said Bentancur had acknowledged his mistake and had pleaded for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur will not return to domestic action until December 26, missing Premier League matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Tottenham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Uruguayan has played 15 times for Tottenham this season, scoring one goal. (AFP)

    Sweden, Finland urge residents to be ready for war

<img alt="Sweden took part in Nato's Steadfast Defender exercises in March 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779741_1_20241118201551.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sweden on Monday began sending some five million pamphlets to residents urging them to prepare for the possibility of war, as neighbouring Finland launched a new preparedness website.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both Sweden and Finland dropped decades of military non-alignment to join the US-led military alliance Nato in the wake of Russia's 2022 assault on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the war, Stockholm has repeatedly urged Swedes to prepare both mentally and logistically for the possibility of war, citing the serious security situation in its vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The booklet "If Crisis or War Comes", sent by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), contains information about how to prepare for emergencies such as war, natural disasters, or cyber-attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is an updated version of a pamphlet that Sweden has issued five times since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous version sent out in 2018 made headlines, as it was the first time it had been sent to Swedes since 1961 at the height of the Cold War.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security situation is serious and we all need to strengthen our resilience to face various crises and ultimately war," MSB director Mikael Frisell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-page document outlines with simple illustrations the threats facing the Nordic nation, including military conflict, natural disasters, and cyber and terror attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It includes tips for preparedness, such as keeping non-perishable food in stock and storing water.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSB said the updated 2024 version had a stronger focus on preparation for war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next two weeks 5.2 million copies will be sent to Swedish households.
  <br>
  <br>
  The brochure is available in print in both Swedish and English and digital versions are available in several other languages – including Arabic, Farsi, Ukrainian, Polish, Somali and Finnish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweden's former army chief Micael Byden alarmed many of his compatriots in January when he urged them to consider their own preparedness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Swedes have to mentally prepare for war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Monday, the government in Finland, which shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia, launched a website gathering information on preparedness for different crises. (AFP)

    Tai Lam Tunnel to charge time-varying tolls: sources

<img alt="Sources said the authorities plan to charge time-varying tolls for Tai Lam Tunnel from May next year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779732_1_20241118184742.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said on Monday that the government plans to charge cheaper, time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel when it takes control of the infrastructure in May.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tolling system would be similar to the ones for the three cross-harbour tunnels brought in last year, with three levels of charges for peak, general and non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, private car drivers need to pay HK$58 for using the tunnel connecting Ting Kau with Yuen Long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said in future, it will be HK$45 for peak, HK$30 for general and HK$18 for non-peak hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  An across-the-board charge of HK$28 is being mooted for taxis, down from HK$58 at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  And commercial vehicles will pay HK$43, which would be cheaper than current toll levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs the Legco transport panel, said he finds HK$45 for private cars during peak hours to be on the high side.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for taxis, he said the toll could be set at HK$25, the same as that for the three cross-harbour tunnels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Compared with the current situation, perhaps some truck drivers using Tuen Mun Road may turn to Tai Lam Tunnel (during peak hours in future), causing further congestion," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I believe if the government charges the time-varying tolls, that can allow the spread of traffic in an orderly manner. I think that's a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tunnel's 30-year franchise began in 1995 and is currently fully-owned by a subsidiary of Sun Hung Kai Properties.

    Fatalities as typhoon Man-yi lashes the Philippines

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 At least eight people were killed as super typhoon Man-yi hit the Philippine archipelago over the weekend, unleashing fierce winds and strong rains that triggered landslides and storm surges, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi, the sixth storm to hit the country in a span of one month, made landfall in the eastern province of Catanduanes on Saturday, but weakened as it moved across the main Luzon island and was later downgraded to a typhoon as it exited the landmass on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A family of seven, including an eight-year-old girl, died after a landslide in a northern provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya buried their home, the disaster office in the area said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Daet town in Camarines Norte province, a 72-year-old man was killed in a vehicular accident caused by hanging cables due to the storm's strong winds, the provincial disaster office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One casualty is one casualty too many. So, that is unfortunate," President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, referring to the death in Camarines Norte. "We will now carry on with the rescue of those isolated areas and the continuing relief for those who have been displaced."
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is approaching Vietnam with maximum sustained winds of 110km per hour and gustiness of up to 135kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rice-producing Nueva Ecija province in northern Luzon, farmlands and villages were flooded, worrying farmers such as Danilo Dagdagan due to the impact on crops and livelihood.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The floodwater from the typhoon and the surrounding provinces gushed here because the elevation of the land here is lower," Dagdagan said inside the living room of his flooded home. "It makes our lives difficult, it's hard for us especially for those without sufficient food."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid has poured in to assist the Philippines in its relief operations, including from the US. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

    'China to build more Belt and Road transport networks'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Monday said the chances of it issuing a T3 over Severe Tropical Storm Man-yi are not high, because winds across the city are not expected to get so strong.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Unless Man-yi adopts a more northerly track or edges closer to the coast of Guangdong with a higher intensity, the chance of issuing Strong Wind Signal No 3 is relatively low," said the observatory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the T1 issued in the morning will remain in place until at least 10am on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Hong Kong is expected to be spared the worst of the storm, showers are likely to become more frequent on Tuesday and some minor flooding is possible in low-lying areas over the next two days, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is expected to skirt around 400 kilometres to the south of the SAR on Tuesday morning.

    First electric ferry to begin tests in HK waters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first electric ferry will arrive in the city this week and will be put into service after tests are completed, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier earmarked HK$350 million for a pilot scheme subsidising operators to introduce a total of four electric ferries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of these, operated by Sun Ferry, will conduct its final tests in Hong Kong waters by the end of this year, before it starts running between North Point and Hung Hom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanessa Au, an assistant director of the EPD, said the use of electric ferries will improve air quality around Victoria Harbour, and they are also more cost-effective.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the operating expenses for ferries can be reduced, but we have to test how much the actual reduction can be," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through this pilot scheme, we hope within 24 months we can compare the electricity consumption and the traditional fuel consumption. Because it's using the motor technology, we hope to cut the maintenance cost as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Au said charging an electric ferry for about eight hours overnight is enough for a full day's operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that solar panels will be installed on the deck of the ferries to support part of the lighting system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Cheng-qi, deputy general manager of Sun Ferry, said he hopes to see more electric ferries in Hong Kong, but the industry needs further assistance from the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Charging facilities may be an obstacle. If supporting facilities can be refined, ferry services can have a better prospect in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EPD said charging facilities have already been installed at North Point, Hung Hom and Kwun Tong ferry piers.

    Hiring all year round boosts civil service recruitment
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said a year-round recruitment drive is proving effective in tackling a manpower crunch across various departments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government has been continuously recruiting for some roles since October last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said this allows job offers to be made more quickly compared to the previous system of only receiving applications once every one or two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have shortened the time required for approval from 10 months to four months, so there has been a tangible surge in the number of acceptances,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because in the past, the period was too long, so successful candidates accepted other job offers. With the year-round recruitment process which has been put in place for some 13 months, we do see an increase in recruitment numbers.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung also told lawmakers that 3,000 civil servants resigned in the 2023/24 period, a rate of 1.8 percent. She said this was a fall from previous years and was “a really low percentage” compared to the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the private sector, according to statistics, the resignation rate stands at double-digit figures in most cases. So 1.8 percent is a really low figure. Forty percent of those resigning from the service have done so before the end of their probationary period,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You could say that perhaps the candidate chosen hasn’t been the right one, and it’s a process for the candidates as well. For the new recruit, early on, if they know that their aspirations and expectations are not met, or if they find themselves unsuited for this post, then they should leave early instead of dragging on.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker So Cheung-wing said that out of hundreds of thousands of applicants, only around 10,000 people had been recruited, questioning whether it was a matter of quality or whether the bureau is trying to control spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said it was because many of the applicants weren't up to scratch, adding that money is available to plug the gaps in manpower.

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>

  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A non-governmental organisation says having a hearing impairment should not be an impediment to seeking mental health support.
 <br>
  <br>
  That is why Silence Limited, one of 11 Operation Santa Claus beneficiaries this year, has launched a project titled "Finding a Way to My Heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGO's Operations Director, Ken Ng, said Silence Limited would provide sign language interpretation services via the project for people with hearing loss during their consultations at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental health issues [are] not easy to diagnose by equipment or machines. Basically, the psychiatrist or the doctors have to talk or communicate with the patients to find out what the real issue is," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many of our clients report that it is not easy to get an in-house sign language interpreter to attend the consultation," said Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Established in 2008, Silence Limited aims to bring people with hearing impairments together, promote social inclusion, and foster equal development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our projects mainly focus on trying to fill up the gaps of existing services, how to improve the mental health situation of our clients. So we will provide or acquire sign language interpreters to participate in the medical consultation sections as well as the workshops or even the activities of our programme," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Joe Biden became the first sitting US president to visit the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, flagging the dangers of global warming often dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to scrap measures to fight climate change.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden flew from Lima, Peru, to Manaus, Brazil, the largest city in the Amazon, to meet with local leaders working to preserve the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dressed casually in a blue shirt and pants, the 81-year-old chatted on the tarmac with local dignitaries before boarding a helicopter to fly over the rainforest.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the helicopter tour, Biden saw severe erosion, ships grounded in one of the Amazon River’s main tributaries and fire damage. He also passed over a wildlife refuge for endangered species of monkeys and birds and the expansive waters where the Negro River tributary flows into the Amazon. He was joined by Carlos Nobre, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and expert on how climate change is harming the Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden met indigenous leaders - introducing his daughter and granddaughter - and visited a museum at the gateway to the Amazon where indigenous women shook maracas as part of a welcoming ceremony. He then signed a US proclamation designating November 17 as International Conservation Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon is home to indigenous communities and 10 per cent of Earth’s biodiversity. About two-thirds of the Amazon lies within Brazil. Scientists say its devastation poses a catastrophic threat to the planet.
  <br>
  <br>
  During brief remarks from the forest, Biden sought to highlight his commitment to the preservation of the region. He said the US was on track to reach US$11 billion in spending on international climate financing in 2024, a six-fold increase from when he started his term.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The fight to protect our planet is literally a fight for humanity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden is making the Amazon visit as part of a six-day trip to South America, the first to the continent of his presidency. He traveled from Lima, Peru, where he took part in the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and met with President Xi Jinping. (Agencies)

    Bills hand Chiefs first loss of 2024 NFL season

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping says he is looking forward to having an in-depth exchange of views with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on further enhancing China-Brazil relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks in a written statement upon his arrival in Rio de Janeiro for the 19th G20 Summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president arrived from Lima, where he had attended the Apec Leaders' meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  People from different walks of life lined the streets of Rio de Janeiro to welcome Xi, who arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday afternoon, local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The welcoming crowds were seen waving Chinese and Brazilian national flags and holding banners adorned with messages offering a warm welcome, as the Chinese leader's motorcade passed by.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his statement, President Xi noted that China and Brazil were marking 50 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties and it was important to build on past achievements while forging ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He extended sincere greetings and best wishes to the government and people of Brazil, describing the two nations as like-minded friends with the same aspirations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said he felt very close to Brazil, having visited four times over the past 30 years and having witnessed development and changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said China and Brazil, as part of the voice of the Global South in the international arena, had made important contributions in promoting world peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he looked forward to attending the 19th G20 Leaders' Summit and was ready to work with all parties to jointly advocate an equal and orderly multi-polar world and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19th G20 Summit will take place in Rio de Janeiro on Monday and Tuesday, under the theme of "building a just world and a sustainable planet". (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain knocked out defending Billie Jean King Cup champions Canada as singles wins for Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter completed a 2-0 victory in Malaga on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu powered through the first set of the opening rubber against Rebecca Marino and held off the Canadian in the second set to wrap up a 6-0, 7-5 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu saved seven break points as Marino tried to force a third set, eventually earning a break of her own in the 11th game before closing out the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments," said the 58th-ranked Raducanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 24 Boulter then brushed aside Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-4 to send Britain through to a semi-final against Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really happy with me level today," said Boulter, who produced another assured display after dropping only three games in her first-round match against Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to say, firstly, Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing a 1-0 up, so full credit to her for starting us off well," she added. "Really proud of my performance today. I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1981.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, the 2002 champions, overcame Australia 2-0 earlier in the day to make the last four of the competition for the first time in 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Rebecca Sramkova both won their singles ties as Slovakia backed up their victory over the United States in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another big country which we beat, and I'm so proud for the girls, for our team members, for our country – because we are a small country," said Slovakia captain Matej Liptak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it really means so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 241 Hruncakova emerged victorious against Kimberly Birrell 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 after over two-and-a-half hours on court to give the central European country the lead over Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova then needed just over an hour to win 6-1, 6-2 against former world number 32 Ajla Tomljanovic, who injured her knee in the third game of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have nothing to lose. That's why I think we enjoy it so much. We are doing good, and hopefully we're going to keep doing that," said Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek will lead Poland as they take on world number four Jasmine Paolini's Italy in the other semi-final. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda captured her seventh LPGA title of the season and 15th career crown on Sunday, firing a three-under par 67 to win the Annika tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old American, playing her first event since being sidelined by a neck injury last month, reeled off five consecutive back-nine birdies to seize the crown by three strokes at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After taking some time off with an injury it was great to be back out here," Korda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing like being in the hunt," she added. "There's nothing like the adrenaline feeling going on the back nine, being in contention – I love it so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Im Jin-hee, China's Zhang Weiwei and England's Charley Hull shared second on 269 with Sweden's Linn Grant and American Rose Zhang sharing fifth on 270.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Korda's third victory in the event after taking the 2021 and 2022 titles and made her the first player since Taiwan's Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annika Sorenstam, the tournament namesake from Sweden, holds the record with 11 titles in the 2002 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is the first American player to win seven LPGA titles in a season since Beth Daniel in 1990 and four of Korda's victories, including Sunday's triumph, came when she trailed entering the final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensured she will be a heavy favorite at next week's season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda added to a 2024 LPGA trophy haul that began in January at the Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  It continued with wins at the Pak Se-ri Championship in Los Angeles, the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play ahead of her second major title at the Chevron Championship and the Americas Open in May, her most recent victory until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The neck injury kept Korda from playing in October in Asia and she had not walked a full 18 holes in nearly two months until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda struggled early with a bogey at the second hole then sandwiched a birdie between bogeys at the sixth and eighth holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that only set the stage for Korda's run of birdies from the 11th through 15th holes, going from two adrift to secure the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not a lot of happy thoughts at the beginning," Korda said. "You should have felt the nerves I was feeling on the back nine." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner won the ATP Finals on Sunday after beating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 to claim his first title at the season-ending event in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner's triumph on home soil was the latest moment of glory in a near-perfect year in which the 23-year-old won eight tournaments, including his debut Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing, it's my first title in Italy and it means so much to me," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something very special. I just tried to understand what works best for each opponent, trying to play my best possible tennis – that was the key," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner again swept Fritz aside in straight sets just as he did in the group stage and the US Open final in September, improving his record on hard courts this year to 50-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is the first Italian to win the Finals, doing so days after becoming the first from his nation to top the ATP's end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Tour-leading 70th win of the season made him the first player since Ivan Lendl in 1986 to win the tournament without dropping a set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to make myself better than last year, to find the keys to win this final. I'm very happy to have handled this pressure and to share this success with the Italian crowd," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went in Sinner's favour after an enthralling seventh game which lasted nine minutes and was eventually won on the fourth break point.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite Fritz's best efforts he couldn't fight back, failing to get a single break point in the second set and succumbing to his opponent's superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz fell short in his bid to become the event's first American champion since Pete Sampras in 1999 but will rise to a career-best of fourth in the rankings Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the good results, it's been a great week for me," said Fritz, beaten for the fourth time in five meetings with Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Jannik and his team because he plays incredible tennis, really incredible," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian great at the top of the game, winning 26 of his past 27 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against his initial exoneration has been hanging over his head since September, when WADA announced it was seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner now heads to Malaga where he hopes to lead Italy to a successful defence of their Davis Cup title. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued a T1 at 6.40am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moved towards the SAR, and warned that it might issue a higher signal later in the day or early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Standby Signal, No. 1 will remain in force at least until 6pm," said the weather forecaster in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight on Monday, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the approach of Man-yi and the northeast monsoon would bring windy conditions on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Depending on the distance between Man-yi and the Pearl River Estuary, its degree of weakening and the change in local wind conditions, the Observatory will assess the need of issuing the Strong Wind Signal, No. 3 tonight to early tomorrow," the Observatory added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory warned that some low-lying areas may see minor flooding in some areas because of the combined effect of the spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, and urged the public to take care.

<img alt="It was Rory McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779589_1_20241117212717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship for the third time and claimed his sixth Race to Dubai title in the process on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland made a crucial birdie on the par-4 16th hole to break a deadlock with Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then birdied the par-5 18th hole for a three-under-par 69 that took him to 15-under for the four days and was enough for a two-shot win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus, who was trying to follow in the footsteps of his twin brother Nicolai and take the trophy back to Denmark for a second year in a row, made a stunning 22-footer par save on the 17th hole, but could not put the pressure on McIlroy on the 18th as he settled for a par and a final round score of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who started with a bogey and then made four successive birdies, dropped a couple of shots around the turn to be tied with Hojgaard after 15 holes at 13-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finally edged ahead with a stunning second shot on the par-4 16th hole from 137 yards to less than a foot for his fifth birdie of the day and drained a six-footer on the final hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including the Zurich Classic that the world number three claimed alongside Shane Lowry, it was McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season and secured him the Race to Dubai crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Adam Scott and Ireland's Lowry shot final-round 68s to tie for third place at 11-under par alongside France's Antoine Rozner. England's Tyrrell Hatton was solo 6th at 10-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 10 players who earned their PGA Tour cards include Hojgaard, Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, England's Paul Waring, Dane Niklas Norgaard, Swede Jesper Svensson, Antoine Rozner of France, Italy's Matteo Manassero, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, Japan's Rikuya Hoshino and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland.

    Israel hits Gaza and Lebanon in deadly strikes

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Strikes by the Israeli military killed dozens in Gaza on Sunday, the civil defence said, while also hitting a Hezbollah stronghold near Beirut's international airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel has been fighting on two fronts since September, intensifying attacks on Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah after nearly a year of cross-border clashes alongside its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after the Gaza war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attacks on its south, Israel vowed to stop the Islamist militants from regrouping in the north of the Palestinian territory, launching a major assault there.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the latest violence in the besieged Palestinian territory, the civil defence agency said Israeli air raids killed at least 46 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadliest strike, in the middle of the night in Beit Lahia in the north, killed 26 people, including women and children, and left at least 59 others buried under the rubble, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike killed 10 people in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, where a separate strike on a house claimed the life of a woman, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Israeli drone strike killed five people in the southern city of Rafah, Bassal said, adding another strike killed three women and a child in the Nuseirat camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry on Sunday said the overall death toll in more than 13 months of war had reached 43,846.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the dead are civilians, according to ministry figures, which the United Nations considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Israel's second front in the north, TV footage showed several strikes hit Hezbollah's south Beirut stronghold, shortly after the Israeli military warned people to evacuate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Columns of smoke were seen rising over the capital's southern suburbs, where Lebanon's only international airport is located.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further south, overnight Israeli air strikes and shelling hit the flashpoint town of Khiam, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the bombardment, the Israeli army said about 20 projectiles were seen crossing from Lebanon into Israel, and that some of them were intercepted. Emergency services did not immediately report any casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has escalated its bombing of Lebanon since September 23 and has since sent in ground troops, following almost a year of limited, cross-border exchanges of fire begun by Hezbollah militants in support of Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its military on Saturday said Hezbollah had already "paid a big price," but vowed to keep fighting until tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north can return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also shelled the southern area of Lebanon along the Litani River, the NNA said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency had earlier reported strikes on the southern city of Tyre, including in a neighbourhood near Unesco-listed ancient ruins. Israel's military said late on Saturday it had hit Hezbollah sites in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lebanon's east, the health ministry said an Israeli strike in the Bekaa Valley killed six people including three children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hezbollah said it fired a guided missile that set an Israeli tank ablaze in the southwestern Lebanese village of Chamaa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In eastern Lebanon, funerals were held for 14 civil defence staff killed in an Israeli strike on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They weren't involved with any (armed) party... they were just waiting to answer calls for help," said Ali al-Zein, a relative of one of the dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese authorities say more than 3,452 people have been killed since October last year, with most casualties recorded since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel announced the death of a soldier in southern Lebanon, bringing to 48 the number killed fighting Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN-backed assessment on November 9 warned famine was imminent in northern Gaza, amid the increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has pushed back against a Human Rights Watch report this week alleging that its mass displacement of Gazans amounts to a "crime against humanity," as well as findings from a UN Special Committee pointing to warfare practices "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."
  <br>
  <br>
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the HRW report as "completely false", while the United States – Israel's main military supplier – said accusations of genocide "are certainly unfounded."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, police said they arrested three suspects after flares shot near the home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the central city of Caesarea, south of Haifa, while he was away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators in Tel Aviv on Saturday reiterated demands that the government reach a deal to free dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protest came a week after mediator Qatar suspended its role until Hamas and Israel show "seriousness" in truce and hostage-release talks. (AFP)

    Russia pounds Ukraine with 'massive' attack

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia on Sunday pummelled Ukraine with a "massive" aerial barrage of missiles and drones, killing at least nine people across the country in the largest attack in months that Kyiv called "hellish."
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow launched 120 missiles and almost 100 drones, targeting Kyiv as well as southern, central and far-western corners of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civilians were killed in the Mykolaiv, Lviv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A hellish night," the spokesman for Ukraine's airforce Yuriy Ignat said on social media, saying Kyiv downed "144 targets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes caused massive power cuts across the country, with fears of a precarious winter to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kyiv called it one of the biggest attacks in the almost three-year-long Russian assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A massive attack on our country," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past week, the aggressor used nearly 140 missiles of various types, more than 900 guided aerial bombs, and over 600 strike drones," he said, accusing Moscow of trying to "intimidate us with cold and blackouts."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack came just two days after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the first time in almost two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is war criminal Putin's true response to all those who called and visited him recently," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said after the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need peace through strength, not appeasement."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv had slammed Scholz for calling Putin, as have many in Germany itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Sunday, Scholz reaffirmed his country's support for Ukraine, saying that no decision on ending the war would be taken without Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine can count on us" and "no decision will be taken behind Ukraine's back," the chancellor said at Berlin airport before flying off to a G20 meeting in Rio de Janeiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has been on the back foot militarily in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow's forces have made steady advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The election of Donald Trump in the US has raised questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican blazingly critical of US aid to Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses heard explosions in the early morning in Kyiv and lose to Sloviansk in the Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow, meanwhile, said it had hit all its targets, claiming it had targeted an "essential energy infrastructure supporting the Ukrainian military-industrial complex."
  <br>
  <br>
  But civilian deaths were reported across Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Kherson said a 51-year-old woman was killed by a drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the southern Mykolaiv region, local leader Vitaliy Kim said two women were killed in a night attack and that seven people – including two children – were wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll included two employees of the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia in the city of Nikopol, who were killed when a depot was hit, the Dnipropetrovsk region's governor Sergiy Lysak and the operator said. Three more people were wounded in the bombing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were also killed in the Odesa region, where a teenager was wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian drones also made their way to Zakarpattia – a mountainous region rarely hit – with officials saying fragments fell in the village of Pavshyno, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytsky, said a 66-year-old woman was killed in her car in the village of Sheptytsky – some 20 kilometres from the Polish border.
  <br>
  <br>
  That prompted Nato-member Poland to scramble fighter jets and mobilise all available forces on Sunday in response.

  <br>
  Warsaw puts its armed forces on alert whenever attacks against its neighbouring country are deemed likely to create a danger for its own territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia, meanwhile, said a man was killed by a Ukrainian drone in its border Belgorod region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's energy operator DTEK on Sunday announced emergency power cuts in the Kyiv region and two regions in the east.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's relentless aerial bombardment has destroyed half of Ukraine's energy production capacity, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Telegram that Russian forces were "attacking electricity generation and transmission facilities throughout Ukraine."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the harsh Ukrainian winter fast approaching, the country is already suffering from major energy shortfalls, while its outmanned and outgunned forces have been steadily ceding ground to the Kremlin's troops for weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv has implored its Western allies for help to rebuild its energy grid – a hugely expensive undertaking – and to supply its outgunned forces with more aerial defence weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But many in Ukraine fear that Western help will not be as freely given following the imminent return of Trump to the White House in January. (AFP)

<img alt="Jorge Martin celebrates with the fans after a stunningly consistent season earned him the title. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779590_1_20241117223710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish rider Jorge Martin claimed his first MotoGP world championship title after finishing third in the season-ending Barcelona GP on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defending two-time champion Francesco Bagnaia, who started the race 19 points behind Martin, took the chequered flag for the 11th time this season but it was not enough to wrest the title from the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It sounds amazing," said an emotional Martin after being addressed as a world champion for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know what to say, I am completely shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is for my people, for my family, for the people who are supporting me, this is for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started crying at the end, it was a very emotional race. It's been a long journey, a lot of crashes, big injuries but finally we are here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope we can keep improving and enjoy the moment. This is the most important thing: live the present and enjoy the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin, who will be leaving his Ducati satellite team Pramac for Aprilia next season, had made himself the favourite for the title with a remarkably consistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had only won three grand prix all season, but his third place on Sunday was the 32nd time this season across the 40 sprints and grand prix that he made the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing third in Saturday's sprint he knew he had only to finish in the top nine to secure the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia, however, has finished the season in blistering form, his victory in Barcelona giving him his fourth win over the final five races of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from pole, the Italian made a perfect start but was soon under pressure from Marc Marquez who slipped past Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin let them battle it out up front, guarding his track position as Aleix Espargaro and Alex Marquez toughed it out behind him.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Martin crossed the line, the celebrations began in the Pramac garage and amongst the many Spanish fans who had made the journey to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was due to take place in Valencia but had to be moved after the region suffered its worst floods in a generation which have killed more than 220 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was switched to Barcelona and has been dubbed the Solidarity GP to show support for the people of Valencia, with all proceeds of the event going to the Valencia relief fund. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 31st edition of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Week has wrapped up with host nation Peru saying it has furthered three objectives, including fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders also issued a joint declaration, calling for a concerted effort in tackling issues such as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to local and international press at the end of the week-long Apec meeting, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte said she was honoured to have hosted the leaders of the bloc’s 20 other economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also praised the professional work of her colleagues for the past year, saying it has reaped immense rewards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those included the signing of a free trade agreement with Hong Kong, and updating the existing one with China, its biggest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boluarte also reiterated three thematic priorities - trade and investment for inclusive and interconnected growth; innovation and digitalisation to promote transition to a formal economy; and sustainable growth for resilient development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before making her concluding remarks, the Peruvian leader and her counterparts got together one final time for the family photo, a longstanding tradition for the Apec summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session offers a chance for the host nation to showcase their traditional attire, but Peru decided to use the occasion to promote their textile products made of alpaca fibre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each leader was given a vicuna wool scarf from a local luxury brand. The price tag? US$1,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours after the summit concluded, the customary Leaders’ Declaration was released.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goals were similar to those in past years, including tackling climate change, reforming the World Trade Organisation, and achieving food and energy security.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A drunk man on Sunday was killed by French police outside Paris after threatening officers and shouting "Allahu akbar," an Arabic expression often shouted by Islamist attackers.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to preliminary information, the man brandished what turned out to be a dummy gun, a source close to the case said. He was "very drunk," the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At around 6.00 am (0500 GMT), police were called to an incident which saw an armed man bang on a door in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, one of the police sources said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man threatened the police "by pointing a handgun and shouting 'Allahu akbar'," a Muslim expression of faith meaning "God is greatest," the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A police officer then drew his weapon and shot the man, who died despite the intervention of the emergency services, the source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to another police source, the officer fired his weapon three times, and the man was hit once. The entire incident was captured by the police body camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, aged 30, committed an "apology for terrorism" in 2019, according to police sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has been referred to the police's IGPN internal affairs department, which is a standard procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police officer who shot the man tested negative for drugs and alcohol. (AFP)

    Super Typhoon Man-yi batters Philippines' main island

<img alt='No fatalities have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to trees and homes. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779585_1_20241117191753.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Super Typhoon Man-yi slammed into the Philippines' most populous island on Sunday, with the national weather service warning of flooding, landslides and huge waves as the storm sweeps across the archipelago nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi was still packing maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour after making its first landfall late on Saturday on lightly populated Catanduanes island.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1.2 million people fled their homes ahead of Man-yi as the weather forecaster warned of a "life-threatening" impact from the powerful storm, which follows an unusual streak of violent weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi uprooted trees, brought down power lines and smashed flimsy houses to pieces after hitting Catanduanes in the typhoon-prone Bicol region.
  <br>
  <br>
  No deaths have been reported, but there was "extensive" damage to structures on Catanduanes, civil defence chief Ariel Nepomuceno said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi remained a super typhoon as it hit heavily populated Luzon – the country's economic engine – forecasters said, warning of a "potentially dangerous" situation in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significant weakening" was expected as it traversed the mountainous island, the weather service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it said severe flooding and landslides were expected as Man-yi dumped "intense to torrential" rain over provinces in its path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters also warned storm surges of up to more than three metres could swamp vulnerable coastal communities, including in Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panganiban municipality in the northeast of Catanduanes took a direct hit from Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Photos and a drone video shared on the Facebook page of Mayor Cesar Robles showed fallen power lines, damaged and destroyed buildings, and trees and corrugated iron sheets strewn on the roads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pepito was so strong, I have never experienced a typhoon this strong," Robles said in a post, using the local name for Man-yi, as clean-up efforts got underway and people returned home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is still a bit unsafe, there are still bursts of wind and there is much debris."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mother-of-three Marissa Cueva Alejandro, 36, who grew up in Catanduanes and sheltered with a relative during Man-yi, said typhoons were getting stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, we would only experience (typhoon) signal number three to four, but now typhoons are getting as strong as signal number five," she said, referring to the weather service's five-tiered wind warning system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi is the sixth storm in the past month to batter the archipelago nation. At least 163 people died in the previous storms, that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather forecaster has hoisted its highest and second-highest typhoon signals over a wide band of provinces stretching from Luzon's east coast, where Man-yi made its second landfall, across to the western side of the island where it will exit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,000 people were in emergency evacuation shelters in Dipaculao municipality in Aurora province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others have stayed home to protect their property and livestock, or because they were sceptical of the warnings, said Geofry Parrocha, communications officer of Dipaculao disaster agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our countrymen are really hard-headed. They do not believe us until the typhoon arrives," Parrocha said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists emptied out of coastal resorts ahead of the typhoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our facilities are deserted," said Irene Padeo, reservation officer of the L'Sirene Boutique Resort in Baler town in Aurora, as Man-yi neared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our outdoor items have all been packed and taken indoors. We tied down all the rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  On its current trajectory, Man-yi will cross north of Manila and sweep over the South China Sea on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory says it will issue a T1 between 6am and 9am on Monday as Tropical Cyclone Man-yi moves towards the territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm is forecast to come within 800 kilometres of the city around midnight tonight, but is expected to weaken.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, windy conditions are likely by Tuesday, the observatory said, warning that some low-lying areas may see flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be a spring tide in the next couple of days. The sea level will be particularly high during the high tide overnight. Under the combined effect of the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the sea level will generally be about a further 0.3 metres above the spring tide at night on Monday and Tuesday. Minor flooding may occur in individual low-lying areas. Members of the public please take appropriate precautions," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that depending on the storm's intensity and distance from the city, it may issue a higher warning signal on Monday night or early Tuesday.

    'Carer hotline should have emergency response team'

<img alt="SoCo urges the government to set up a team offering emergency services under its 24-hour hotline for carers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779566_1_20241117152725.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hotline offering assistance to caregivers is failing to address the urgent needs of some callers and a special team is needed to provide emergency support, a community group says.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 182 183 hotline launched last year is staffed 24 hours a day and the government says it offers strong support to callers with a range of enquiries, including those who want counselling or details of community services.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo) on Sunday said a joint study with Lingnan University's Asia-Pacific Institute of Ageing Studies (APIAS) has shed light on the difficult situation many carers find themselves in.
  <br>
  <br>
  A survey carried out between March and June this year found that on average, those being looked after suffered from two chronic illnesses – as did the carers themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Dickson Chan, the director of APIAS, said the hotline isn't enough to address the needs of some carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [hotline staff] may give them another phone number and ask them to call another organisation. This means that actually they cannot receive concrete and immediate support through the hotline," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our proposal is maybe the government can consider setting up a special team and the special team is attached to the hotline. So when the older people are in urgent need... the hotline can maybe pass the needs to a special team and after a brief assessment, the team can offer immediate support services for the older people."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo meanwhile called for the government to relax eligibility requirements so more people can get financial support under the Scheme on Living Allowance for Carers of Elderly Persons from Low-income Families.

 Plumbers, electricians and specialised construction workers will be among those first invited to Hong Kong under the SAR's next scheme to bring in employees from elsewhere, the government said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials say Hong Kong faces a shortfall of around 180,000 workers by 2028, but plans are already afoot to bring in 30,000 skilled technicians over three years under a new scheme starting in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun told TVB that the administration will first focus on finding new blood for sectors facing the worst manpower crunches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said their visas will tie them to the occupation they are in when they first move to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will surely be special arrangements for these visas, meaning that before they become Hongkongers, they will be required to stay in the job where we had a shortage. This is very clear," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But after seven years when they obtain permanent residency, you can't have so many requirements. We surely cannot lock workers down to a particular job forever."
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief said he believes the workers concerned will mostly choose to stay in their profession after becoming a permanent resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed that the government remains committed to encouraging locals into work, adding that subsidies for those re-joining the workforce will remain in place.

 Some 12,000 people on Sunday took part in special races on the airport's third runway to celebrate its opening later this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The other two runways at Chek Lap Kok remained in use as the 10-kilometre events took place, with Hong Kong long-distance runner Virginia Lo among those on the tarmac as planes went up and down nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite athlete sponsored by the Sports Institute was the first to the finish line among local runners and she said the time was her personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite extraordinary. Because when I was running, there was really an aeroplane next to me. Of course it wasn't very close, but when you run, when you see a plane nearby you feel very excited," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think the weather affected the race much. Luckily the sun wasn't shining, this is good for runners. Also when we started, the rain had stopped. So I find the weather quite acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  World-renowned actor Chow Yun-fat also took part in one of the races, and he was happy with the experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very....very special. You can see planes on both sides, taking off and landing, taking off and landing," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was concerned I couldn't run. If it was raining heavily, I wouldn't have taken part. But when I arrived, it stopped. And when we were actually running, the wind was quite good."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that a cross-border investment programme linking Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong has boosted the SAR's attractiveness in global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the number of eligible stocks now stands at more than 3,300 – up from about 800 when Stock Connect was launched 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said daily transactions by mainland investors buying local stocks average about HK$38 billion, or almost 17 percent of total turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  For overseas investors buying and selling mainland stocks through Hong Kong, the average daily amount is 123 billion renminbi, or 6.7 percent of turnover.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the local stock market has a total market value of HK$35 trillion, which is a 40 percent increase from 10 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the government is fostering links with the Global South and aims to attract high quality companies to list in the city and roll out cross-border investment products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said this will allow Hong Kong to better make use of its function as a testing ground for the internationalisation of the renminbi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the third Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit to be held this week will involve a few hundred senior members of staff from international financial institutions, and will allow participants to get an accurate understanding of the mainland's economic development and the financial opportunities it offers.

    Peru trade pact set to take effect in six months: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says Hong Kong's new free trade agreement with Peru will take effect in about six months or so, as he urged SAR businesses to “understand and appreciate” the pact and join the government’s efforts to explore opportunities in emerging markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media at the conclusion of his trip to Lima, Lee said that as well as attending the Apec summit, the Hong Kong delegation achieved three key results, the first of which was demonstrating the city’s commitment to promoting regional economic and trade cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Second, we explored new growth areas for Hong Kong and explored market opportunities in South America,” he continued, citing the pact with Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the agreement will open new doors for businesses, adding that he is confident Hong Kong people can get around the language barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong people have been doing business with different parts of the world, including the Middle East, including countries such as Korea and Japan. So obviously, language is an issue, but it's not a barrier,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I believe in the businessmen’s versatility and adaptability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the government will lead promotional efforts so that the city’s businesses can better understand the Peruvian market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to fast-track exchanges between the two sides, Lee said, is to establish chambers of commerce and he has already made this pitch to Peruvian officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third and final achievement in Lima, the chief executive went on to say, was enhancing relations with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that he held bilateral meetings with leaders of Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, and said there are plans to increase direct flights between Hong Kong and several Asean destinations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE had two informal exchanges in Lima with Xi Jinping and Lee expressed gratitude to the president for his "care and guidance"
  <br>
  <br>
  “President Xi has always been caring about Hong Kong. I have reported to him Hong Kong's situation regarding the economy and development. He is well-versed of our development and has given me encouragement,” Lee said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fly-half Thomas Ramos kicked 15 points to help France beat New Zealand 30-29 in a thrilling Test clash in Paris on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romain Buros, Paul Boudehent and Louis Bielle-Biarrey were the hosts' try-scorers as they claimed a third-straight win over the All Blacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lakai and Cam Roigard crossed for New Zealand before Damian McKenzie's contributions with the boot set-up a nervy last half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  France head coach Fabien Galthie recalled experienced centre Gael Fickou to the starting lineup in one of four changes from last Saturday's easy win over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand boss Scott Robertson welcomed back fly-half Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor after the influential pair missed last week's win over Ireland with injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the game New Zealand captain Scott Barrett said his side lost the scrum battle with the French in their World Cup defeat 13 months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the set-piece proved crucial in the opening score as the visitors were penalised and Les Bleus led 3-0 after seven minutes thanks to a Ramos shot at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robertson's outfit reacted almost immediately to make it 7-3 as Lakai, a second-minute replacement, crashed over for his maiden Test try and Beauden Barrett slotted the extras after nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks had the upper hand after the opening quarter, profiting from a poor France lineout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their dominance paid off even further after half an hour as scrum-half Roigard celebrated his 24th birthday by intercepting a pass destined for opposite number Antoine Dupont after a scrum to stroll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  With seven minutes of the first-half to play, France cut the score to 14-10 as full-back Buros crossed on his Test debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the interval, New Zealand led 17-10 as Beauden Barrett added a penalty to his earlier two conversions with the visitors in control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, the tight one-pass play paid off for the hosts as they trundled up the field before flanker Boudehent found a way over from a rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos kicked the conversion to bring the sides level at 17-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie had picked an extra forward on the bench by dropping fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the matchday squad and after 47 minutes brought on four of them at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, it bore fruit, as France led for the first time in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winger Bielle-Biarrey dotted down after a Ramos grubber kick and with the Toulouse playmaker's extras they were 24-17 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the try, the game was far from over and with 17 minutes to go McKenzie kicked two penalties either side of a Ramos effort to make it 27-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKenzie added a third penalty for 27-26 with 13 minutes to go and a tense final 10 minutes was set-up as Ramos and McKenzie once again traded shots at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks were camped in their own territory but their attack was held up and referee Nika Amashukeli blew the full-time whistle to send the majority of the 80,000-capacity crowd delirious. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday vowed to work with the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged," following the election, Xi said, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Xi that the two leaders haven't always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said the two countries' relationship would make "considerable progress" when both nations "treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, according to a simultaneous translation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come two months before Trump assumes office. (Reuters)

<img alt="The New York Times has reported that Elon Musk met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779495_1_20241116195555.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran's foreign ministry spokesman on Saturday "categorically" denied The New York Times report on Tehran's ambassador to the United Nations meeting with US tech billionaire Elon Musk, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with state news agency IRNA, spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was reported as "categorically denying such a meeting" and expressing "surprise at the coverage of the American media in this regard."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported on Friday that Musk, who is a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, met earlier this week with Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani.
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited anonymous Iranian sources describing the encounter as "positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian newspapers, particularly those aligned with the reformist party that supports President Masoud Pezeshkian, largely described the meeting in positive terms before Baghaei's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks leading up to Trump's re-election, Iranian officials have signalled a willingness to resolve issues with the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, both countries have communicated through the Swiss embassy in Tehran and the Sultanate of Oman. (AFP)

 An Indian state riven by months of ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew on Saturday after angry protests over the recovery of six bodies of people believed to have been kidnapped by insurgents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manipur in India's northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than 18 months between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community, dividing the state into ethnic enclaves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies were suspected to be of those belonging to the Meitei community who went missing in Jiribam district after a gunfight between Kuki insurgents and Manipur police last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three bodies were pulled from a river in Jiribam on Friday while three more were found on Saturday, local media reports said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the discovery provoked incensed mobs to attack the homes of seven local politicians, but only minor damage had been recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters also burned tyres and blocked roads in the capital city of Imphal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Manipur government announced a curfew was in effect in part of the city due to the "developing law and order situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The state's home ministry also ordered all internet and mobile data services in Manipur to be shut off for two days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anti-social elements might use social media extensively for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video messages inciting the passions of the public which might have serious repercussions for the law and order situation," a notice said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur last year during an outbreak of violence which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of the state's residents are living in emergency shelters, still unable to return home due to ongoing tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain. (AFP)

 The guitar described by Noel Gallagher as "the best in the world," which he played on the third Oasis album "Be Here Now," sold at auction on Saturday for £226,800 (US$286,000).
 <br>
  <br>
  The custom Silver Sparkle Gibson Les Paul Florentine guitar that starred on the 1997 album was one of Gallagher's primary guitars during the height of Oasis's fame.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was made for him at Gibson's custom shop and appeared in performances on The David Letterman Show and Saturday Night Live.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not one of the best guitars. It's the best guitar," Gallagher said of the instrument in a 1997 interview with Spin magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guitar was sold in a sale of entertainment memorabilia by online auction group Propstore. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Militants stormed a paramilitary checkpoint in southwestern Pakistan on Saturday, killing seven troops, the latest in a string of attacks by separatist insurgents, police said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The early-morning attack in the mountainous Kalat district, some 150 km south of Quetta, capital of the southwestern Balochistan province, continued for several hours, said police officer Habib-ur-Rehman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 18 wounded paramilitary soldiers, some in critical condition, were admitted to local hospitals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that its fighters had attacked the checkpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has stepped up its operations recently, claiming a suicide bombing last week that targeted Pakistani army troops at a railway station minutes before they were due to board a train to return home for vacations. It killed 27, including 19 soldiers, who were in civilian clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA and several other militant groups have been fighting for decades for a separate homeland to gain a greater share of the mineral and resource-rich Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he would like to end the war with Russia next year through "diplomatic means."
 <br>
  <br>
  He spoke a day after saying he expected the conflict to end sooner than it would otherwise have done, once Donald Trump takes office in the United States next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For our part, we must do everything we can to ensure that this war ends next year. We have to end it by diplomatic means," Zelensky said in an interview with Ukrainian radio. "And this, I think, is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been no meaningful talks between Russia and Ukraine, but a Trump presidency raises questions about the future of the conflict, with the Republican repeatedly saying he would end the war swiftly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to understand what the Russians want," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referring to Ukraine, he said: "You are at war with a state that does not value its people, that has a lot of equipment, that does not care how many people die."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will only accept talks with Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders Ukrainian territory that Moscow occupies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said he repeated that demand in a phone conversation with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has rejected Putin's conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow has made steady advances in eastern Ukraine since this summer, inching closer to key hubs such as Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said on Saturday that Russian forces were suffering heavy losses and that the adance had "slowed down" in some areas. (AFP)

    Trump pick Hegseth accused of 2017 sexual assault

<img alt="Donald Trump's choice for defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, was not charged over the allegation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779487_1_20241116182956.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet picks just became even more so: Pete Hegseth, tapped for defence secretary earlier this week, was accused of sexual assault in 2017, according to police.
 <br>
  <br>
  No charges were filed in the case, but shocked Trump transition team officials are nonetheless reportedly weighing the next steps for the Fox News host, whose nomination took many in Washington by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Trump nominated the 44-year-old National Guard veteran on Tuesday to run the world's most powerful military, despite having never managed a large organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in Monterey, California confirmed on Thursday that they had investigated "an alleged sexual assault" at a hotel involving Hegseth that included bruising to the victim's right thigh, in early October 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the woman's accusations caught the Trump team off guard, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported the story.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's lawyer Timothy Parlatore told the publication that the allegation "was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said that Hegseth "has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defence so he can get started on Day One to Make America Safe and Great Again," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth's hearing in the Senate is likely to be among the more fraught, not only due to his lack of experience but also other controversies, such as his lobbying of Trump during his first term to pardon service members accused of war crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth joined Fox News as a contributor in 2014 and now co-hosts "Fox and Friends Weekend" and serves as a host for "Fox Nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He additionally served as an infantry officer in the National Guard, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations against Hegseth come as Trump's pick for attorney general, far-right former congressman Matt Gaetz, stunned many following his lengthy embroilment in sexual misconduct allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump himself was convicted of financial wrongdoing for covering up payments to a former porn star and found liable for defaming and sexually abusing an author.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hegseth has been married three times, divorcing his first wife in 2009 following an "irretrievable breakdown" and "infidelity," according to the Washington Post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second wife filed for divorce in September 2017, one month after he had a baby with a Fox News producer whom he subsequently married, according to US media. (AFP)

    Kai Tak hosts rugby match as dummy run for new venue

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday hosted an international rugby match in gloomy weather as another trial event to test the site's smaller outdoor venue, with more signage and faster security checks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match between Hong Kong and Brazil kicked off at around 4 pm at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, which hosted a local football league game last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 2,500 people turned up to the sports ground in the end, according to the government, fewer than the previous estimate of 3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rugby match, which ended in pouring rain, saw the SAR team claim a 38-17 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including sports minister Kevin Yeung and security chief Chris Tang were spotted at the stadium, with the latter saying authorities have made improvements since the previous trial event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have doubled the number of security screening counters, and set up fast lanes for those who did not bring any bags," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said after the match that the event went more smoothly than the first trial, and that the government would continue to put the sports ground to the test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to hold a series of trial events and drills until the venue's official opening in the first quarter of next year... Next Saturday, we will conduct a stress test with 5,000 people," Yeung said, adding that more details would be unveiled in the coming week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby, hailed the test run's success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a great opportunity for our team to come to operate an event here, in advance of the Hong Kong Sevens next March. As we build up towards the Sevens, it's been a great experience and a very good opportunity for our rugby community to come to the venue to experience the Kai Tak Sports Park, and to see what a great venue it is," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator surnamed Mak said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports park's indoor stadium is to host a basketball match on December 7, while the first trial run at the main stadium is scheduled for January next year.

    UN climate chief urges G20 to push for COP29 deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN's climate chief urged G20 nations on Saturday to push COP29 negotiations towards a deal to raise money for developing nations, warning there was a "long way to go."
 <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators worked through the night to narrow their differences at the UN talks in Baku before ministers arrive next week for the final days of the summit, but major differences remain.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell appealed for leaders of the Group of 20 nations, which includes the world's biggest economies and top polluters, to weigh in when they meet in Brazil on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As G20 Leaders head to Rio de Janeiro, the world is watching and expecting strong signals that climate action is core business for the world's biggest economies," Stiell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some developing countries, which are least responsible for global greenhouse gas emissions, want an annual commitment of US$1.3 trillion to help them adapt to climate impact and transition to clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is over 10 times what donors including the United States, the European Union and Japan currently pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the negotiations are stuck over a final figure, the type of financing and who should pay, with developed countries wanting China and wealthy Gulf states to join the list of donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft deal was 25 pages long, and still contained a raft of options.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here in Baku negotiators are working around the clock on a new climate finance goal," Stiell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a long way to go, but everyone is very aware of the stakes, at the halfway point in the COP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Climate finance progress outside of our process is equally crucial, and the G20's role is mission-critical." (AFP)

  <br>
  <br>
  Spectators must purchase their tickets online prior to the event, and they were not allowed to bring in long umbrellas or any food and drink.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a spectator, surnamed Mak, said the rule was too strict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A drawback is that we are not allowed to bring our water bottles into the venue. I wish they could be more lenient and let us bring our own water," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  For rugby-lover Derek, the cloudy weather posed a bit of a problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's quite convenient to get from the MTR station to the venue, but it's troublesome to have to carry an umbrella on rainy days," he said. "I would suggest adding some covers for walkways... My feet were completely soaked."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A super typhoon sweeping towards the Philippines on Saturday was intensifying and could have a "potentially catastrophic" impact, the state weather forecaster warned, with millions of people at risk from storm surges.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 650,000 people have fled their homes ahead of Super Typhoon Man-yi, which is expected to make landfall later on Saturday or early on Sunday, becoming the sixth major storm to pummel the archipelago nation in the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  With wind gusts of up to 240 kilometres per hour, Man-yi was on track to slam into the sparsely populated island province of Catanduanes as a super typhoon or "near peak intensity", the weather service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Potentially catastrophic and life-threatening situation looms for northeastern Bicol region as Super Typhoon 'Pepito' further intensifies," the forecaster said in its latest update, using the local name for the storm and referring to the southern part of the main island of Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to 14-metre high seas were expected around Catanduanes, while more than 7.6 million people were at risk from storm surges of one to three metres, the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 163 people died in the five storms that pounded the Philippines in recent weeks that also left thousands homeless and wiped out crops and livestock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government urged people on Saturday to heed warnings to flee to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If preemptive evacuation is required, let us do so and not wait for the hour of peril before evacuating or seeking help, because if we did that we would be putting in danger not only our lives but also those of our rescuers," Interior Undersecretary Marlo Iringan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Albay province, Legazpi City grocer Myrna Perea was sheltering with her fruit vendor husband and their three children in a school classroom with nine other families after they were ordered to leave their shanty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions were hot and cramped – the family spent Friday night sleeping together on a mat under the classroom's single ceiling fan – but Perea said it was better to be safe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think our house will be wrecked when we get back because it's made of light materials – just two gusts are required to knock it down," said Perea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why we evacuated. Even if the house is destroyed, the important thing is we do not lose a family member."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists have warned climate change is increasing the intensity of storms, leading to heavier rains, flash floods and stronger gusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evacuation centres were filling up on Catanduanes island in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, with the weather forecaster warning of "widespread incidents of severe flooding and landslides."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 400 people were squeezed into the provincial government building in the capital Virac, with new arrivals being sent to a gymnasium, said provincial disaster officer Roberto Monterola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monterola said he had dispatched soldiers to force about 100 households in two coastal villages near Virac to move inland due to fears storm surges could swamp their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the exact landfall point, heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surges may occur in areas outside the predicted landfall zone," the forecaster said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Naga city in Camarines Sur province imposed a curfew from midday on Saturday in a bid to force residents indoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Northern Samar province, disaster officer Rei Josiah Echano lamented that damage caused by typhoons was the root cause of poverty in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's a typhoon like this, it brings us back to the mediaeval era, we go (back) to square one," Echano said, as the province prepared for the onslaught of Man-yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  All vessels – from fishing boats to oil tankers – have been ordered to stay in port or return to shore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 4,000 people were stranded after the coast guard shut 55 ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volcanology agency also warned heavy rain dumped by Man-yi could trigger flows of volcanic sediment, or lahars, from three volcanos, including Taal, south of Manila.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man-yi will hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season – most cyclones develop between July and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, four storms were clustered simultaneously in the Pacific basin, which the Japan Meteorological Agency said on Saturday was the first time such an occurrence had been observed in November since its records began in 1951. (AFP)

<img alt="Even Viktor Wembanyama, (1), cannot stop LeBron James breaking another record. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779474_1_20241116160216.jpg&q=80">

 Anthony Davis scored 40 points and LeBron James made more history to spark the Los Angeles Lakers over San Antonio 120-115 on Friday, launching their bid to defend the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  James managed a triple-double in a fourth consecutive game for the first time in his 22 NBA seasons, the 39-year-old legend delivering 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists over a game-high 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the game and I'm happy I'm still able to come out here and make some plays to help our ball club win," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  James tied a Lakers triple-double record streak and became the oldest player in NBA history with four triple-doubles in a row, all in winning efforts, although his seven turnovers stung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just putting the work in. My teammates trust me with the ball," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess they trusted me a little too much tonight with the seven turnovers. I've got to be a lot better than that if I'm going to have the ball in my hands. I'll clean that up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, won a battle of the big men with last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, Frenchman Victor Wembanyama, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Spurs in the West Group B clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another magnificent game by AD," James said. "We lean on AD every night. The ball goes to him not only the first option but also the second option... He has definitely been a beast this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Stephon Castle's basket gave the Spurs a 115-114 lead, Davis made a slam dunk with 91 seconds to play and James sank a layup, his first basket in more than 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Castle missed a tying 3-point attempt and James made two free throws to seal San Antonio's fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis drove to the hoop and banged his right knee into the left knee of Wembanyama late in the game but both were playing at the finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, downing Chicago 144-126 as games were played in all six NBA Cup groups with results also counting in the NBA regular-season standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland improved to 14-0 as Donovan Mitchell scored 37 points to lead the East Group C rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just so much fun. The vibes are right," Cleveland's Jarrett Allen said. "It just seems like everything is clicking right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers are only the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0, matching the fourth-best start in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group A, Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox scored 60 points but the host Kings lost to Minnesota 130-126 in overtime as Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, James Harden matched Ray Allen for second behind Stephen Curry on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list on 2,973, scoring 21 points for the Los Angeles Clippers in a 125-104 loss at Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabari Smith led the Rockets with 28 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 28 points to lead Oklahoma City over visiting Phoenix 99-83, keeping the Thunder in the Western Conference lead at 11-2 in the Group B game.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group C, Brandon Ingram had 29 points as host New Orleans snapped a six-game losing skid by beating Denver 101-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the league's rebounds and assists leader, was out for personal reasons as Denver's five-game win streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, Golden State reserve Buddy Hield had 18 points and 12 Warriors scored in a 123-118 home victory over Memphis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group C, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels led eight double-figure scorers with 25 points as the Hawks beat visiting Washington 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group A, Franz Wagner scored 31 points to lead Orlando over visiting Philadelphia 98-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  At New York, Jalen Brunson's 3-pointer with six seconds remaining gave the Knicks a 124-122 victory over Brooklyn. Brunson had 37 points while Cam Thomas hit 43 for the Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group B, Bam Adebayo scored 30 points as Miami beat host Indiana 124-111 while Malik Beasley's 20 points led Detroit over host Toronto 99-95. (AFP)
