 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday vowed to promote world peace in New Year's greetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the international situation changes, China will remain steadfast in further comprehensively deepening reform and promoting world peace and development," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying that both countries always move forward hand in hand along the right path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said he is ready to maintain close exchanges with Putin and maintain the general direction of China-Russia cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted to Putin that 2024 marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, "representing a new important milestone in the relationship”, CCTV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After three-quarters of a century of ups and downs, China-Russia relations have become increasingly mature and stable," Xi added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Hart delivered his third triple double of the season on to spark the New York Knicks in a 126-106 victory at Washington that stretched their win streak to eight games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hart had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his ninth triple double with the Knicks while Karl-Anthony Towns had a game-high 32 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson and O.G. Anunoby each scored 18 points for New York, which improved to 23-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks led 59-57 at halftime over the Eastern Conference doormats, and pulled away in the third quarter and dominated the fourth to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We executed. We got stops and we played fast," Hart said. "We played to our strengths. Sometimes it takes us a little while to wake up – we always do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at New Orleans, James Harden sank four free throws in the final 17 seconds to give the Los Angeles Clippers a 116-113 victory over the host Pelicans – as the NBA's worst club dropped a 10th consecutive game to sink to 5-28 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norman Powell scored a game-high 35 points, while Harden added 27 as the Clippers improved to 19-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Chicago's Coby White had 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to spark the Bulls to a 115-108 overtime victory at Charlotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miles Bridges, who hit a 3-pointer with one second remaining in regulation to force overtime at 98-98, had a game-high 31 points for the Hornets. (AFP)

    S Korea court issues arrest warrant for impeached Yoon

<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for impeached, suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, investigators said on Tuesday, over his short-lived bid to impose martial law on the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, requested by the Joint Investigation Headquarters, were issued this morning," the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators probing Yoon over his declaration of martial law requested the warrant on Monday after the suspended president failed to report for questioning a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime," a Corruption Investigation Office official told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The warrant is valid until January 6," the official said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer called the arrest warrant for the impeached president "illegal and invalid", saying investigators lacked the authority to probe the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid," a statement from lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has stressed that any operator is welcome to take part in a tendering exercise next year for the management of Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, adding that the existing firm would have to bring something new to the table if it wanted to stay on.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they will put managing rights of the terminal up for tender three years before the existing contract expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also review the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement to make the cruise terminal more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the existing operator wants to join the tendering exercise, we'll review its performance over the years. We'll also look at whether the operator can adapt to the current situation, and offer new insights and suggestions," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for who will end up winning the bid, we're keeping an open mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed it would be too late to launch a tender exercise in 2027 being as the current agreement ends in May 2028, saying authorities have to give the new operator sufficient preparation time before taking over.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The State Council on Tuesday appointed Chan Tsz-tat as the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, replacing Louise Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan joined the department as an inspector in 1994. He became an assistant commissioner in 2020, and was promoted to deputy commissioner two years later, responsible for the force's management and strategic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence in Chan's ability to lead Customs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Chan has served in the Customs and Excise Department for 30 years and has extensive experience in departmental operations. He possesses solid management and leadership skills," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also conveyed his appreciation to Ho for her contributions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, 57, has proceeded on pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined Customs in 1991, and became Hong Kong's first female Customs chief in 2021.

    'C919 can help HK grow into aviation engineering hub'

<img alt="Aviation specialist Jason Li says Hong Kong - as the first city outside mainland China to host C919 flights - shows its importance in advancing the national aviation sector. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785571_1_20241231092107.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland aviation specialist says using the domestically-produced C919 aircraft for daily flights in Hong Kong will help the SAR become an aviation engineering hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern Airlines is deploying the narrow-body passenger jet on a direct route between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the first set of flights due to take off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past 50 or 60 years, Hong Kong has worked as an [aviation hub], but due to the lack of a local aircraft manufacturer, it is not an aircraft or aviation engineering hub," Jason Li told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, was increasing its engineering investment in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, as you can see... COMAC is putting more China-produced C919 into Hong Kong. They are building an engineering team in Hong Kong," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can see that aviation [requires] a comprehensive engineering team. There are so many different parts; mechanical, electronic etc. So there will be much more career opportunities for local young people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the choice of Hong Kong as the C919's first destination outside mainland China shows the city's important role in advancing the national aviation sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is encouraging and letting more enterprises demonstrate their newest technology and the business in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong's status as an international city meant the C919 would have more exposure to overseas clientele, such as those from Southeast Asia, the United States, and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said he expected more C919 jets flying into Hong Kong in the next couple of years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China Eastern Airlines currently has 10 C919s... I expect that in 2025, when they reach about 15 or 20, there will be an extra pair from Shanghai to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for other carriers, for example Air China or China Southern Airlines - if they reach about five or 10 C919s - there will be flights from Beijing to Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should urgently address its ageing population as well as issues that come with demographic changes, according to family experts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024, the experts also issued a warning about how declining fertility rates and rising life expectancies would affect the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rapid ageing is impacting all continents, especially Asia, where longevity has increased dramatically. And that's impacting care systems ... and investments have to be made," said Renata Kaczmarska, a social affairs officer at the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demographic changes was one of four "megatrends" that the three-day conference looked at. The others were new technologies, urbanisation and migration, as well as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patricia Chu, co-chairperson of the summit, said the four were not standalone issues and that Hong Kong had to deal with an ageing society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[An] ageing population and demographic changes are the top priority... I think the government is aware of this and they are beginning to do more
  <br>
  ... on this front," said Chu, who also chairs the Consortium of Institutes on Family in the Asian Region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How [to] prepare and help the older generation to make the best use of [information and communication technology] is also another issue, which is integrated with the ageing population," she added.

 Russia and Ukraine swapped more than 300 prisoners of war on Monday in an exchange brokered by the United Arab Emirates ahead of New Year's Eve, officials from both countries said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have exchanged hundreds of captive soldiers since Russia began its military assault on Ukraine in February 2022, in one of the few areas of cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On 30 December, as a result of the negotiation process, 150 Russian servicemen were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, 150 Ukrainian army prisoners of war were handed over," the Russian defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv received 189 people as part of the deal, including soldiers, border guards and two civilians from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to free everyone from Russian captivity. This is our goal. We do not forget anyone," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Monday that Moscow had released a total of 3,956 people - soldiers and civilians - in deals with Kyiv since the start of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides said the latest exchange had been brokered by the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video published by Russia's human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova showed soldiers gathered outside buses, wearing winter clothes and military fatigues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you for your service, patience and courage," Moskalkova said, wishing them a happy New Year's holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very soon our guys will embrace their relatives and friends and celebrate the New Year in their native land," she wrote in a Telegram message accompanying the video. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury verdict ordering US President-elect Donald Trump to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.
 <br>
  <br>
  A New York jury found after a nine-day civil trial last year that the former president had sexually abused Carroll at a Manhattan department store in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was ordered to pay US$2 million for sexual abuse and another US$3 million for defaming Carroll, a former advice columnist for Elle magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict on the grounds that two other women who said Trump had sexually assaulted them too should not have been allowed to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-judge panel of the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conclude that Mr Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carroll was awarded US$83 million by another jury in a separate case she brought against Trump. He has also appealed that verdict. (AFP)

    Villa held by Brighton after late Lamptey equaliser

<img alt="Brighton midfielder Tariq Lamptey (L) celebrates scoring the team's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785562_1_20241231074227.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

    Chelsea rocked by Ipswich; Man Utd lose 4th straight

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)

 US markets closed lower on the penultimate trading day of a year in which the benchmark indices have notched up strong gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.0 percent to 42,573.73, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 5,906.94, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.2 percent to 19,486.79.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sam Stovall of CFRA stressed that there was no major catalyst behind the shift, and the lead-up to New Year's Day was typically a low-volume period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, he expected that investors would be closely eyeing data that could give the US Federal Reserve reason to hold back on rate cuts, such as consumer inflation readings.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets have already reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls, investors are also monitoring further details of his trade policy -- after his threats of sweeping new tariffs on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some major tech stocks slumped Monday, with Tesla shares dropping 3.3 percent and Facebook parent Meta losing 1.4 percent. (AFP)

    Govt appeals ruling on golf course flats plan

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it's appealing the ruling for the sake of public interest. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785522_1_20241230210005.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday that it has lodged an appeal against the High Court’s recent ruling that overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the month, the court ruled in favour of the Golf Club and ordered the administration to relaunch a public consultation on the project’s impact on the environment, citing flaws in its environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, both the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) are appealing against the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ruling would have significant systemic impacts on ongoing and future environmental impact assessments, in particular, it may lead to serious delays in development, operation and execution of the development proposals," the EPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, noted that while officials had already secured enough land to meet the housing supply target for the next decade, an appeal is crucial because the ruling has far-reaching implications.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This appeal is not solely for the proposed housing project but, more importantly, for seeking clarifications from the Court of Appeal on important subjects concerning the principles and legal issues of the EIA framework. The government policy is to strike a balance between environmental protection and development for the overall benefit of Hong Kong,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had originally planned to build 12,000 public housing units at the site.

<img alt="Officials want the value the tourism sector adds to the economy to rise by 60 percent to HK$120 billion in five years. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785501_1_20241230173647.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday said it wants to nurture and develop tourism by focusing on culture, sports, ecotourism and mega-events, with a view to boost the economy by HK$120 billion and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in five years.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they would promote smart tourism - such as introducing virtual reality elements at tourism attractions - to improve the experience of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strategy would be to strengthen the city's appeal in traditional markets like the mainland, while attracting more travellers from the Middle East and Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants to attract more visitors who stay overnight instead of only making day trips to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In five years, officials want a near 60 percent rise in the value the tourism sector adds to the economy, from last year’s base, to HK$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said there was a need to highlight the unique elements of the SAR, such as emphasising the city’s East-meets-West culture to promote tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Hong Kong’s beautiful shoreline, she said, officials would actively look into developing resort projects in the outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will use our different routes to bring more tourists to our coastal landforms, our ecoparks, and also our beautiful seashore area in Sai Kung, and also on Lamma [Island] and Cheung Chau, all these areas, on Lantau," the minister told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will explore with other departments, the possibility of developing larger-scale ecotourism facilities such as hotels, spas or other facilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government plans to promote horse-racing and cruise tourism while enriching some of the city's famous urban walking routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in five years' time, the government expects the sector to have created 210,000 jobs, a more than 40 percent rise from last year's figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that regulators would look into changing the tour guide licensing regime, with a view to attract more new talent to the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, guides need to obtain a full licence by passing different tests on areas like ecotourism or history, but officials are now considering offering partial licences to aspiring guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’m pleased to hear that the [Travel Industry Authority] is considering a partial licence, so that people with a specific interest could actually focus on their areas of interest. By then, I hope that we’ll be able to attract and facilitate more people joining the tourism workforce," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government would otherwise import workers to the trade through existing labour schemes.

 Medical experts are calling on the public to maintain good hygiene and get flu jabs, after clinics reported a surge in infections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Hong Kong Medical Association, Cheng Chi-man, said on a RTHK programme on Monday that clinics have seen a significant increase in patients in the last two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said the SAR may see a more serious flu outbreak if temperatures drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winter in Hong Kong is generally mild. This Lunar New Year in January, the flu outbreak could be less serious as long as the weather isn't that cold and temperatures just fall to between 10 and 15 degrees" he said on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if temperatures dip below 10 degrees, the outbreak could happen quickly and it could be more serious than in the past.”

    China expresses 'deep condolences' over Carter's death

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

    Govt to shift focus to talent retention: Chris Sun

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun says the government will shift its focus from luring talent to retaining talent in the SAR, adding the talent hunt will continue beyond international sports stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Sun also said there are no plans to expand labour importation schemes to cover more sectors other than construction, transport and care homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, snooker stars Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan both became Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the fact that international sports stars come to Hong Kong via various talent admission schemes shows how attractive the city is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are internationally renowned sports stars and foreigners. They have many choices, but they chose Hong Kong. I believe this is the best way to show the world Hong Kong's appeal. It speaks louder than words," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our talent search, not limited to sports stars. Through our talent schemes, we are searching for some world-class talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late 2022, around 175,000 people have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, adding around 350,000 to the city's population along with their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief added there are no plans to provide housing allowances for imported professionals as the government makes housing a priority for local permanent residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council (TDC) says it will lead a delegation to Indonesia next month to try to drum up business with Asean's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 people, including senior executives and start-up bosses, will join the trip to Jakarta, visiting companies and taking part in networking events.
  <br>
  <br>
  TDC research director Irina Fan on Monday said Hong Kong is Indonesia's second largest investor, but the country is only the SAR's sixth largest trading partner when it comes to Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of the enterprises that invest in Indonesia through Hong Kong are mainland subsidiaries or branches in the SAR. Their parent company is on the mainland, but they enter the Indonesian market through Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said figures from Indonesian officials show the SAR invested a total of US$18.5 billion in over 8,400 projects in the country between 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that Indonesia has been participating in the TDC's exhibitions, with products such as clothing, electronics and toys, showing that firms there are very much interested in reaching out to buyers from the mainland and elsewhere.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A driver involved in a fatal crash in Jordan was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death, police said on Monday, after one person was killed and two other pedestrians were injured when the car he was driving mounted a pavement in Jordan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were notified at around 10am of the incident near Luen Tak Building on Jordan Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vehicle was reportedly travelling westbound on the road before ploughing into pedestrians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When approaching the junction of Jordan Road and Shanghai Street, the private car reportedly went out of control and knocked down three pedestrians after running onto the pavement," a police statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three were rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of them, an elderly person who was found unconscious, was pronounced dead after sustaining multiple serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The driver, 42, reported feeling unwell and was sent to Kwong Wah Hospital, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have classified the crash as a fatal traffic accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said the accident resulted in a stretch of Jordan Road to be closed to traffic.

<img alt="Mourners stand at a memorial altar for victims of the Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785453_2_20241230120403.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok on Monday ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused deadliest air disaster in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  All 175 passengers and four of the six crew were killed when a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway at Muan International Airport, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall. Two crew members were pulled out alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top priority for now is identifying the victims, supporting their families and treating the two survivors, Choi told a disaster management meeting in Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As soon as the accident recovery is conducted, the transport ministry is requested to conduct an emergency safety inspection of the entire aircraft operation system to prevent recurrence of aircraft accidents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport ministry said authorities were considering whether to conduct a special inspection of all 101 Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by South Korean airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air flight 7C2216, arriving from the Thai capital Bangkok with 175 passengers and six crew on board, was trying to land shortly after 9am on Sunday at the airport in the southwest of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the crash, fire officials have said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts say many questions remain, including why the plane, powered by two CFM 56-7B26 engines, appeared to be travelling so fast and why its landing gear did not appear to be down when it skidded down the runway and into a wall.
  <br>
  <br>
  CFM International is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and France's Safran.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, transport ministry officials said as the pilots made a scheduled approach they told air traffic control the aircraft had suffered a bird strike, shortly after the control tower gave them a warning birds were spotted in the vicinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilots then declared mayday and signalled their intention to go around shortly before the aircraft came down on the runway in a belly landing and crashed into a structure at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials are investigating what role the wall at the end of the runway played in the crash, including the embankment on which it was standing, transport ministry officials told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crash killed mostly local residents who were returning from holidays in Thailand, while two Thai nationals also died.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday morning, investigators were trying to identify some of the last remaining victims, as anguished families waited inside the Muan airport terminal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park Han-shin, who lost his brother in the crash, said he was told by authorities that his brother had been identified but has not been able to see his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Park called on other victims' families to unite in responding to the disaster and recovery efforts, citing a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. Prolonged efforts to identify the victims and cause of the sinking followed that disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers were sifting through wreckage that was nearly completely destroyed when the aircraft was engulfed in an explosion of flames and debris at the regional airport near the country's winding western coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transportation ministry officials said the jet's flight data recorder was recovered but appeared to have sustained some damage on the outside and it was not yet clear whether the data was sufficiently intact to be analysed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Muan airport remains closed through Wednesday but the rest of the country's international and regional airports including the main Incheon International Airport near Seoul were operating as scheduled. (Reuters)

    Investigators seek arrest warrant for President Yoon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing South Korea's Yoon Suk-yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law on Monday said they sought an arrest warrant for the suspended president after he failed to report for questioning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader also faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A former prosecutor himself, Yoon had been summoned three times by investigators for questioning, but refused to present himself each time -- including by yesterday's deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Joint Investigation Headquarters filed an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk-yeol with the Seoul Western District Court", said the probe team in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The application by investigators marks the first attempt in the country's history to forcibly detain a president before the impeachment procedure is complete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is being investigated by prosecutors as well as a joint team comprising police, defence ministry, and anti-corruption officials. (AFP)

    Haliburton leads Pacers over Celtics; Magic hang on

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points as the Pacers turned the tables on the NBA champion Celtics with a confident 123-114 victory in Boston.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after Jaylen Brown's 44 points propelled the Celtics to a 142-105 blowout victory over the Pacers, Indiana got their revenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haliburton added six rebounds and seven assists without a turnover and six players scored in double figures for Indiana, whose lights-out shooting in the second quarter saw them seize a seven-point halftime lead that they would push to as many as 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown stayed hot, delivering 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting with six assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each for Indiana, with Nembhard adding eight rebounds and eight assists as he returned after missing Friday's game with left knee tendinitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nembhard said maintaining their pace in the fourth quarter – when Boston cut an 11-point deficit to two with seven and a half minutes to play, was key for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that was the biggest thing we did late in the game," he said. "We kept pace in the game. We didn't slow it down and worry about the score too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Orlando, Cole Anthony drove for the game-winning layup as the Magic erased a 21-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Tristan da Silva scored 21 points to lead the injury-ravaged Magic. Goga Bitadze added 19 and Anthony scored five of his 10 in the fourth quarter, as Orlando closed the game on a 22-4 scoring run.

  <br>
  Cam Thomas, back after missing 13 games with a hamstring strain, came off the bench and led Brooklyn's scoring with 25 points but missed a jump shot as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony admitted that da Silva, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, was supposed to get the ball on the play that yielded his game winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When that failed to pan out, he said, "I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go get a layup".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nets were without veteran Dorian Finney-Smith, who was traded along with Shake Milton to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a deal that sent D'Angelo Russell back to Brooklyn. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter "lived a life measured not by words, but by his deeds," President Joe Biden said on Sunday in televised remarks addressing the death of the former US leader.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden's tribute, like many that came in from US and global leaders, focused on Carter's character, with the outgoing president describing his predecessor as seeming to be from a "bygone era."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just look at his life, his life's work," Biden said, speaking from the US Virgin Islands, where he was on vacation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He worked to eradicate disease, not just at home, but around the world. He forged peace, advanced civil rights, human rights, promoted free and fair elections around the world. He built housing for the homeless with his own hands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden also declared January 9 a national day of mourning for Carter, calling on Americans to visit their places of worship to "pay homage" to the late US leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr," Biden said in a White House proclamation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the former US presidents, Bill Clinton said his predecessor had "worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."
  <br>
  <br>
  George W. Bush said Carter "dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn't end with the presidency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Barack Obama hailed Carter for teaching "all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer paid tribute to Jimmy Carter for his "lifelong dedication to peace" and said the former US president had "redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Jimmy Carter served as US president when Ukraine was not yet independent but "his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply appreciate his steadfast commitment to Christian faith and democratic values, as well as his unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's unprovoked aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Cuba, the island's leader Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Sunday his nation would remember Carter "with gratitude".
  <br>
  <br>
  During his presidency, Carter made moves to normalise diplomatic ties and relax US sanctions on the country, and "our people will remember with gratitude his efforts to improve relations," Diaz-Canel said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Panama's President Jose Mulino said negotiations with Carter "achieved the transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands and the full sovereignty of our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President-elect Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in January, has threatened to demand the key waterway be returned to the United States, which originally completed and operated it. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East division title after handing the Dallas Cowboys a humiliating 41-7 defeat, while the Buffalo Bills secured the second seed in the AFC with a 40-14 crushing of the New York Jets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cowboys were already eliminated from playoff contention and without top receiver CeeDee Lamb with a shoulder injury, but it was their defence that struggled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles starting quarter-back Jalen Hurts missed the game due to concussion. Kenny Pickett got the start but had to leave the game in the third quarter with a rib injury with Philadelphia 24-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant third-choice Tanner McKee took over under the centre and two of his four passes were for touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real damage to the Cowboys, who gave up four turnovers, was done by the Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley who put up 167 yards on 31 carries to pass the 2,000 yard mark for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, who has 2,005 yards needs to put up 101 yards next week to break Eric Dickerson's record for the most rushing yards in a season, set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it," Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means the Eagles are guaranteed at least the number two seed in the NFC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bills took the second seed in the AFC behind defending champions Kansas City Chiefs, after taking care of business against the New York Jets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills led 12-0 at the half before their quarterback Josh Allen took total control of the game with touchdown passes to Amari Cooper and Keon Coleman either side of a rushing score from James Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who threw for 182 yards, had opened the scoring with a one-yard rush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw two interceptions and was sacked four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying," he added. "But it had no effect on us.” (AFP/AP)

    Former US president Jimmy Carter dies, aged 100

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as US president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday, the Carter Center said. He was 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  “My father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love,” said Chip Carter, the former president’s son. “My brothers, sister, and I shared him with the rest of the world through these common beliefs. The world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honoring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A Democrat, he served as president from January 1977 to January 1981 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 US election. Carter was swept from office four years later in an electoral landslide as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lived longer after his term in office than any other US president. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a better former president than he was a president - a status he readily acknowledged.
  <br>
  <br>
  His one-term presidency was marked by the highs of the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, bringing some stability to the Middle East. But it was dogged by an economy in recession, persistent unpopularity and the embarrassment of the Iran hostage crisis that consumed his final 444 days in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, Carter had experienced several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain. Carter decided to receive hospice care in February 2023 instead of undergoing additional medical intervention. His wife, Rosalynn Carter, died on Nov. 19, 2023, at age 96. He looked frail when he attended her memorial service and funeral in a wheelchair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter left office profoundly unpopular but worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his "untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter had been a centrist as governor of Georgia with populist tendencies when he moved into the White House as the 39th US president. He was a Washington outsider at a time when America was still reeling from the Watergate scandal that led Republican Richard Nixon to resign as president in 1974 and elevated Ford from vice president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm Jimmy Carter and I'm running for president. I will never lie to you," Carter promised with an ear-to-ear smile.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked to assess his presidency, Carter said in a 1991 documentary: "The biggest failure we had was a political failure. I never was able to convince the American people that I was a forceful and strong leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, a voice for the disenfranchised and a leader in the fight against hunger and poverty, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts to promote human rights and resolve conflicts around the world, from Ethiopia and Eritrea to Bosnia and Haiti. His Carter Center in Atlanta sent international election-monitoring delegations to polls around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Southern Baptist Sunday school teacher since his teens, Carter brought a strong sense of morality to the presidency, speaking openly about his religious faith. He also sought to take some pomp out of an increasingly imperial presidency - walking, rather than riding in a limousine, in his 1977 inauguration parade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Middle East was the focus of Carter's foreign policy. The 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, based on the 1978 Camp David accords, ended a state of war between the two neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland for talks. Later, as the accords seemed to be unravelling, Carter saved the day by flying to Cairo and Jerusalem for personal shuttle diplomacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The treaty provided for Israeli withdrawal from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and establishment of diplomatic relations. Begin and Sadat each won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the 1980 election, the overriding issues were double-digit inflation, interest rates that exceeded 20% and soaring gas prices, as well as the Iran hostage crisis that brought humiliation to America. These issues marred Carter's presidency and undermined his chances of winning a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 4, 1979, revolutionaries devoted to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had stormed the US Embassy in Tehran, seized the Americans present and demanded the return of the ousted shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was backed by the United States and was being treated in a US hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American public initially rallied behind Carter. But his support faded in April 1980 when a commando raid failed to rescue the hostages, with eight US soldiers killed in an aircraft accident in the Iranian desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter's final ignominy was that Iran held the 52 hostages until minutes after Reagan took his oath of office on January 20, 1981, to replace Carter, then released the planes carrying them to freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another crisis, Carter protested the former Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. He also asked the US Senate to defer consideration of a major nuclear arms accord with Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unswayed, the Soviets remained in Afghanistan for a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter won narrow Senate approval in 1978 of a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama despite critics who argued the waterway was vital to American security. He also completed negotiations on full US ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter created two new US Cabinet departments - education and energy. Amid high gas prices, he said America's "energy crisis" was "the moral equivalent of war" and urged the country to embrace conservation. "Ours is the most wasteful nation on earth," he told Americans in 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1979, Carter delivered what became known as his "malaise" speech to the nation, although he never used that word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the American people I have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world can't fix what's wrong with America," he said in his televised address.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways. It is a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America."
  <br>
  <br>
  As president, the strait-laced Carter was embarrassed by the behaviour of his hard-drinking younger brother, Billy Carter, who had boasted: "I got a red neck, white socks, and Blue Ribbon beer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jimmy Carter withstood a challenge from Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination but was politically diminished heading into his general election battle against a vigorous Republican adversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan, the conservative who projected an image of strength, kept Carter off balance during their debates before the November 1980 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reagan dismissively told Carter, "There you go again," when the Republican challenger felt the president had misrepresented Reagan's views during one debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan, who won 44 of the 50 states and amassed an Electoral College landslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, one of four children of a farmer and shopkeeper. He graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1946, served in the nuclear submarine program and left to manage the family peanut farming business.
  <br>
  <br>
  He married his wife, Rosalynn, in 1946, a union he called "the most important thing in my life." They had three sons and a daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter became a millionaire, a Georgia state legislator and Georgia's governor from 1971 to 1975. He mounted an underdog bid for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, and out-hustled his rivals for the right to face Ford in the general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Walter Mondale as his vice presidential running mate, Carter was given a boost by a major Ford gaffe during one of their debates. Ford said that "there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration," despite decades of just such domination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter edged Ford in the election, even though Ford actually won more states - 27 to Carter's 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not all of Carter's post-presidential work was appreciated. Former President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush, both Republicans, were said to have been displeased by Carter's freelance diplomacy in Iraq and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004, Carter called the Iraq war launched in 2003 by the younger Bush one of the most "gross and damaging mistakes our nation ever made." He called George W. Bush's administration "the worst in history" and said Vice President Dick Cheney was "a disaster for our country."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, Carter questioned Republican Donald Trump's legitimacy as president, saying "he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf." Trump responded by calling Carter "a terrible president."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter also made trips to communist North Korea. A 1994 visit defused a nuclear crisis, as President Kim Il Sung agreed to freeze his nuclear program in exchange for resumed dialogue with the United States. That led to a deal in which North Korea, in return for aid, promised not to restart its nuclear reactor or reprocess the plant's spent fuel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Carter irked Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration by announcing the deal with North Korea's leader without first checking with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2010, Carter won the release of an American sentenced to eight years hard labor for illegally entering North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter wrote more than two dozen books, ranging from a presidential memoir to a children's book and poetry, as well as works about religious faith and diplomacy. His book "Faith: A Journey for All," was published in 2018. (Reuters)

<img alt="Liverpool's Diogo Jota celebrates scoring the side's fifth goal with Harvey Elliott and Mohamed Salah. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785405_1_20241230050629.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rampant Liverpool smashed West Ham 5-0 on Sunday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points as Manchester City returned to winning ways at troubled Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to second in the table with a fifth straight win at Everton, while Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham conceded late to draw 2-2 against Vitor Pereira's rejuvenated Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's Liverpool look unstoppable in their quest for a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title, recording their 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz opened the scoring against Julen Lopetegui's hapless team on the half-hour, before Mohamed Salah set up Cody Gakpo for the second with some audacious footwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egypt international then scored his 20th goal of the season shortly before half-time to put the visitors in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 4-0 with a deflected shot from distance in the 54th minute and Diogo Jota completed the rout, courtesy of another Salah assist following a surging run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy," said Slot, flying in his first season in the Anfield hotseat after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's striking success has come against the background of mounting speculation over the futures of Salah, Alexander-Arnold and captain Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three can discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer from January 1 but remain focused on winning a second Premier League title together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only thing on my mind is I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of that," Salah told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best for the team to win the trophy. There are a few other teams catching up with us and we need to stay focused and humble."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, defending champions City travelled to relegation-threatened Leicester drained of confidence after just one win in all competitions since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their frailties over the past two months, which resulted in nine defeats in their previous 13 games, were on display again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Savinho's first-half goal and an Erling Haaland header after the break made it 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's bid for a fifth straight title looks to be over as they are 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result lifts them to fifth in the table and within striking distance of fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our mood is in a better position. It was tight in the second half, they were much better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the new year can help us bounce back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest beat Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park, leapfrogging Chelsea and Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood chipped over Jordan Pickford for the opening goal in the 15th minute after being set up by Anthony Elanga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wood turned provider for Forest's second, which came just after the hour mark when Morgan Gibbs-White produced some neat footwork before firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Spurs were on track to end a torrid December on a high after first-half goals by Rodrigo Bentancur and Brennan Johnson cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan's brilliant opener for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham captain Son Heung-min also squandered a 43rd-minute penalty, but it did not appear to be too costly until substitute Jorgen Strand Larsen smashed home in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the person in charge, so of course it hurts," said Postecoglou, whose team have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I see how hard they are trying, it hurts even more because you want them to get a reward and I think today they deserved a reward for their efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace won just their second home league game of the season, seeing off bottom club Southampton 2-1, thanks to goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Eberechi Eze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara scored an 89th-minute leveller as Bournemouth drew 2-2 at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea and Manchester United are in action on Monday, with Arsenal travelling to Brentford on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Ahmed al-Sharaa is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist group that led the coalition that seized power in Damascus. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785401_1_20241230042017.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told Al Arabiya on Sunday that elections could take four years, noting the importance of ties with Iran and Russia and calling for the United States to lift sanctions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The election process could take four years," Sharaa told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television, three weeks after his Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied rebels ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to rewrite the constitution" which could take "two or three years", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the wide-ranging interview, he expressed hope that the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on his now war-torn and impoverished country under Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sanctions on Syria were issued based on the crimes that the regime committed," Sharaa said, adding that since Assad was gone, "these sanctions should be removed automatically".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by many governments including the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader also noted the importance of ties with Russia and Iran, which were both key allies of Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Syria cannot continue without relations with an important regional country like Iran, but they must be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and non-interference in the affairs of both countries," Sharaa said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Russia is an important country and is considered the second most powerful country in the world," he said, noting the "deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "All Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts... We do not want Russia to leave Syria in the way that some wish," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharaa also said local Kurdish-led forces which Turkey opposes would be integrated into the national army.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Weapons must be in the hands of the state alone. Whoever is armed and qualified to join the defence ministry, we will welcome them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on these criteria, "we will open a negotiations dialogue with the SDF, to perhaps find an appropriate solution," referring to the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's north and northeast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two drug trafficking cases will be brought up at West Kowloon Magistrates Courts on Monday, after 30 kilos of suspected ketamine - with a street value of HK$14 million - was seized at Hong Kong International Airport on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first case involves a man, aged 25 who had flown in from Frankfurt, and a 24-year woman who was arrested later at Hong Kong International Airport. The second involves a 47-year-old woman who had flown from Frankfurt, via Taipei.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs said all three suspects were locals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, in an emergency meeting on Sunday evening, declared a national mourning period until January 4 over the plane crash at Muan International Airport.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jeju Air passenger plane skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames after its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people on board died in one of the country’s worst aviation disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that had arrived in the South Korean city from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 179 people - 85 women, 84 men and 10 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable - died in the fire, the South Korean fire agency said. Emergency workers pulled two people, both flight attendants, to safety. Health officials said they are conscious and not in life-threatening condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  A transport official said both black boxes - the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder - have been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, bowed deeply with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he felt “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular checkups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members wailed as officials announced the names of some victims at a lounge in the Muan airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.

    Hong Kong Food Festival sees dip in footfall

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vendors at the Hong Kong Food Festival have remained conservative on sales with some finding less visitors this year than before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-day event ending Sunday began on Christmas Day at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  One merchant, surnamed Lok, said the weeks-long Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in Causeway Bay has pulled away potential customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's obviously because the Brands and Products Expo is being held at Victoria Park at the same time. It opened a day earlier than us. Its admission fee is HK$10, and here, it is HK$30. Admissions are free there after 7pm, but people still need to pay here," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the perspective of consumers, I think they will go to the expo and check out local brands."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the drop in footfall, vendor Wong said his business saw a 15 to 20 percent jump from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, people are relatively more willing to spend. It's true that there are fewer people than previously, but the purchasing power is stronger," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, surnamed Mak, said he spent around HK$1,000 at the festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't normally buy this much. I bought more than usual because of the variety and promotions," he said. “There were less people this year, it was more crowded last year. It could be because some left Hong Kong to spend elsewhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's food festival was held alongside several other shopping events, with around 1,000 booths participating in total.

<img alt="Chris Tang says he feels honoured to have completed the enactment of Article 23 national security legislation with his colleagues.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang has described the successful enactment of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year as the most formidable challenge of his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video shared on his social media platform on Sunday, he said he and his team fearlessly hit back at smears and refuted false accusations along the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he managed to put up with a number of physical ailments as he and his colleagues worked on the legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I remember the time when I suffered from inflamed eyes due to a lack of sleep. My frozen shoulder and gout also relapsed. However, witnessing all my colleagues tirelessly working day and night, I forgot about these minor inconveniences. At that time, none of us could even keep track of how many takeaway meals we had," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were driven by a determination to face challenges head-on, so we persevered. Eventually, the legislation was passed unanimously, allowing me to feel truly honoured to have completed this historic mission hand in hand with my comrades. Upholding national security is our mission. Promoting national security and patriotic education is also our duty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang also highlighted changes in immigration policies for the SAR this year, such as bringing back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and introducing mainland travel cards for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the security chief said he and his colleagues will continue to push ahead with various stress tests at Kai Tak Sports Park to ensure the smooth opening of the facility.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The stench of gasoline hangs over Muan International Airport. Behind a police cordon, plane seats, suitcases and twisted bits of metal are scattered, close to the wrecked fuselage of Jeju Air flight 2216.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed as it attempted an emergency landing on Sunday, smashing into a wall and bursting into flames, leaving all but two people aboard feared dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of emergency workers put out the fire and combed through the wreckage, but only two people, both flight attendants, were rescued alive, with 177 confirmed dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late afternoon, floodlights illuminated the twisted wreckage as a huge yellow crane lifted the fuselage, allowing officials to continue the search and rescue mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Behind a police cordon tape stretched across the wire fence at the edge of the runway, plane seats and other chunks of metal could be seen, offering a glimpse into the catastrophic impact of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inside the airport terminal, family members gathered to wait for news, many looking stunned and tearful.
  <br>
  <br>
  One woman was carried away on a stretcher, apparently having passed out from shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boards typically used for arrival and departure information were instead displaying the names, dates of birth and nationalities of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a son on board that plane ... He has yet to be identified," one elderly man waiting in the airport lounge, who asked not to be named, told AFP
  <br>
  <br>
  Wailing and screaming echoed through the two-storey airport, as the names and identities of victims were confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the passengers, who were all Korean nationals except for two Thais, had been returning home after their winter holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My younger sister went to heaven today," one 65-year-old woman who gave only her surname Jo told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her sister had been in Bangkok with her friends on holiday, the woman, wearing a mask and a grey knit hat, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My husband is now trying to check whether she's been identified," Jo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight had 175 passengers, including two Thai nationals, and six crew onboard.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to authorities, the youngest passenger was a three-year-old boy and the oldest was a 78-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the dead were children under the age of 10, authorities said, citing the passenger manifest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only sounds near the crash site were the whirring of cameras and the murmur of reporters broadcasting live, as hundreds of relatives, lost for words, awaited news of their loved ones aboard the burned plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the area around the runway, AFP reporters could see duty-free booklets and sanitary gloves worn by the flight crew scattered across the field, not far from the charred tail of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the deadliest aviation accident on South Korean soil and the worst in years involving the country's carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A moment of silence was held at sporting events, including volleyball and basketball games, on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  All major South Korean broadcasters changed their schedules to emergency news programming.
  <br>
  <br>
  End-of-the-year entertainment award shows and comedy shows were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident comes as South Korea is in the midst of political chaos, after suspended president Yoon Suk-yeol was impeached earlier this month over his ill-fated attempt to declare martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The acting president was also impeached on Friday, leaving the country with its third leader in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civic groups said they were reviewing whether to postpone mass impeachment rallies in light of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heartbreaking stories of family members were also shared online, with one saying his mother and his five aunts were one the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was told they would arrive around 8.50 am today, so I came to the airport to pick up my mother and aunts, but I've heard no word from them," he told local media anxiously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runway at Muan airport will be closed until later this week, authorities said, as investigators probe the cause of the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  One heart-wrenching screenshot of the final Kakao Talk message exchange between a passenger and their family has been widely reported in local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The message from the parent and passenger reads: "Wait, a bird is stuck in the wing. Unable to land now... Should I leave a will?"
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the last message, sent at 9.01 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their child replies: "Why can't I make a call with you?". It was delivered at 9.37 am and has remained unread.

 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Sunday called on people to get vaccinated as soon as possible, saying there’s been a rise in influenza cases in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV programme, the professor of respiratory medicine at Chinese University said both public hospitals and private clinics have reported an increase in patients with flu symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said he’s expecting the flu season to peak next month, as people wrap up their holidays and return from places which saw outbreaks of H1N1 flu like the mainland, Japan, and Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expert reminded high risk groups, including the elderly, children and those who’re overweight, to stay vigilant and get their flu jabs if they haven't already done so.

<img alt="Australia's Nathan Lyon bats on day four of the fourth cricket Test match between Australia and India in Melbourne. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785372_1_20241229164710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Marnus Labuschagne half-century and stubborn tail-end batting drove Australia to a 333-run lead at the end of day four in the fourth test in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving India facing a record chase to steal victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland marched off to a big ovation from home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having combined for an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket as Australia went to stumps at 228 for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon was 41 not out, with number 11 Boland on 10 and India's hopes of winning badly diminished in the final hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the five-test series level at 1-1, India's pace dynamo Jasprit Bumrah threatened to turn the match with a three-wicket burst before tea in front of 43,867 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But number three Labuschagne (70) and his captain Pat Cummins (41) steadied Australia with a 57-run partnership before Boland and Lyon frustrated India further.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day ended sourly for the tourists when Bumrah had Lyon caught in the slips by a juggling KL Rahul in the final over -- with a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only one team has chased more than 300 for victory in an MCG test; England mowed down 332 to beat Australia in 1928.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Boland and Lyon made the going look easy, Labuschagne said there was enough in the pitch for Australia's bowlers on day five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement (off the seam) has probably been the same but just the amount of bounce is significantly lower," Labuschagne told reporters of the changing wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that makes for pretty tricky batting because more balls are hitting the stumps from a shorter length."
  <br>
  <br>
  As impressive as Australia's rearguard resistance was, it followed some shoddy middle order batting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having been in command at 80 for two, Australia crumbled in a Bumrah-led onslaught to slump to 91 for six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammed Siraj triggered the collapse when Steve Smith chased a wide, full delivery and nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to be out for 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah had Travis Head caught at square leg for one to earn his 200th test wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck again four balls later to remove number six Mitchell Marsh for a duck with a gloved catch to Pant before bowling Alex Carey through bat and pad for two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia were wobbling but Cummins rode out the storm with typical defiance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored 49 in the first innings, he produced a vital 41 to stall India's momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Labuschagne was out lbw to Siraj, Cummins added another 25 runs with Mitchell Starc (five) and Lyon before falling to the spin of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fielding mishaps also cost India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped two chances, with Labuschagne spared at 46 when he nicked Akash Deep to the gully and opener Usman Khawaja reprieved on two with a spill at leg gully.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khawaja went on to make 21 before Siraj bowled him in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitish Kumar Reddy also missed a tough chance to remove Cummins for nine, misjudging the flight of the ball when chasing the Aussie skipper's slog over mid-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  India may still count themselves blessed to be in the game at all. They were on the ropes on day three until Reddy rescued them with a maiden century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder finished with 114, his 189-ball vigil ended by spinner Lyon a few overs into the fourth morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me, I think everyone is capable of playing on this pitch," the 21-year-old told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll come back strong in the batting order."
  <br>
  <br>
  The healthy day four crowd brought total match attendance to 299,329, a record for a Boxing Day test in Melbourne. (Reuters)

<img alt="Firefighters and rescuers work near the wreckage of a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 at Muan International Airport. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785363_1_20241229143707.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A passenger plane burst into flames on Sunday after it skidded off a runway at a South Korean airport and slammed into a concrete fence when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, killing at least 151 people, officials said, in one of the country's worst aviation disasters.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency said rescuers raced to pull people from the Jeju Air passenger plane carrying 181 people at the airport in the town of Muan, about 290 kilometres south of Seoul. The Transport Ministry said the plane was a 15-year-old Boeing 737-800 jet that was returning from Bangkok and that the crash happened at 9.03 am. local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 124 people — 57 women, 54 men and 13 others whose genders weren’t immediately identifiable — died in the fire, the fire agency said. The death toll is expected to rise further as the rest of the people aboard the plane remain missing about six hours after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency workers pulled out two people, both crew members, to safety, and local health officials said they remain conscious. The fire agency deployed 32 fire trucks and several helicopters to contain the fire. About 1,560 firefighters, police officers, soldiers and other officials were also sent to the site, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage of the crash aired by YTN television showed the Jeju Air plane skidding across the airstrip, apparently with its landing gear still closed, and colliding head-on with a concrete wall on the outskirts of the facility. Other local TV stations aired footage showing thick plumes of black smoke billowing from the plane, which was engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jeong-hyeon, chief of the Muan fire station, told a televised briefing that the plane was completely destroyed, with only the tail assembly remaining recognizable among the wreckage. Lee said that workers were looking into various possibilities about what caused the crash, including whether the aircraft was struck by birds, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport Ministry officials later said their early assessment of communication records show the airport control tower issued a bird strike warning to the plane shortly before it intended to land and gave its pilot permission to land in a different area. The pilot sent out a distress signal shortly before the plane went past the runway and skidded across a buffer zone before hitting the wall, the officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Transport Ministry official Joo Jong-wan said workers have retrieved the flight data recorder from the plane’s black box and are still looking for the cockpit voice recording device. He earlier said that government investigators arrived at the site to investigate the cause of the crash and fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency officials in Muan said the plane’s landing gear appeared to have malfunctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said the plane's passengers include two Thai nationals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident in a post on social platform X. Paetongtarn said she ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerati Kijmanawat, the director of the Airports of Thailand, confirmed in a statement that Jeju Air flight 7C 2216 departed from Suvarnabhumi Airport with no reports of abnormal conditions with the aircraft or on the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air in a statement expressed its “deep apology” over the crash and said it will do its “utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised news conference, Kim E-bae, Jeju Air’s president, deeply bowed with other senior company officials as he apologised to bereaved families and said he feels “full responsibility” for the incident. Kim said the company hadn’t identified any mechanical problems with the aircraft following regular check-ups and that he would wait for the results of government investigations into the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing said in a statement on X it was in contact with Jeju Air and is ready to support the company in dealing with the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,” Boeing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s one of the deadliest disasters in South Korea’s aviation history. The last time South Korea suffered a large-scale air disaster was in 1997, when a Korean Airline plane crashed in Guam, killing 228 people on board. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines plane crash-landed in San Francisco, killing three and injuring approximately 200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday’s accident was also one of the worst landing mishaps since a July 2007 crash that killed all 187 people on board and 12 others on the ground when an Airbus A320 slid off a slick airstrip in Sao Paulo and collided with a nearby building, according to data compiled by the Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit group aimed at improving air safety. In 2010, 158 people died when an Air India Express aircraft overshot a runway in Mangalore, India, and plummeted into a gorge before erupting into flames, according to the safety foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident came as South Korea is embroiled into a huge political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s stunning imposition of martial law and ensuing impeachment . Last Friday, South Korean lawmakers impeached acting President Han Duck-soo and suspended his duties, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to take over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi ordered officials to employ all available resources to rescue the passengers and crew before he headed to Muan. Yoon’s office said his chief secretary, Chung Jin-suk, will preside over an emergency meeting between senior presidential staff later on Sunday to discuss the crash. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Labour Department (LD) said it is deeply concerned about a fatal accident at a construction site in Yau Ma Tei, in which a 53-year-old worker was killed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the male worker was struck by a falling glass panel while it was being lifted with a set of lifting equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the accident happened at a site above the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending all curtain wall installation work of the construction site, including lifting and handling of glass panels. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken," a department spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims also said on Sunday that it is saddened and very concerned about the accident, and called on the Labour Department to be transparent with its findings.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it will provide the worker’s family with support and assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong's economy remains strong and resilient, despite potential market volatility stemming from uncertainties like geopolitics and high interest rates by 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing in his weekly blog, Chan said Hong Kong's asset market has shown substantial improvement, with the local stock market rising by about 18 percent this year and the Hang Seng Index rebounding to 20,000 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trading volume has also significantly increased, reaching a historical high of over HK$600 billion in a single day in October. This year, the average daily trading volume exceeds HK$132 billion, up more than 25 percent from last year," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The initial public offering (IPO) market has also become more active, with fundraising from new listings exceeding HK$80 billion, ranking fourth globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said family office businesses are also thriving, with about 2,700 single family offices now operating in the SAR. Additionally, the number of companies from the mainland and overseas in Hong Kong has nearly reached 10,000, including around 4,700 start-ups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also pointed out that authorities are actively working to attract more professionals to Hong Kong, having received approximately 410,000 applications through various talent schemes over the past two years, and approving around 260,000 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan acknowledged that the retail and dining sectors continue to face challenges, but he believes that the reintroduction of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, along with the holiday season, will bring in more visitors and give the industry a much needed boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the new year, he stressed that Hong Kong will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages, enhance systematic investment in local innovation and technology, and solidify the SAR's position as an international financial, trade, and shipping hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Bangkok to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday, killing at least 120, emergency services said, with a bird strike and adverse weather conditions cited as likely causes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two survivors -- one crew and one passenger -- were plucked from the wreckage as part of an ongoing rescue operation, the national fire agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video shared by the local MBC broadcaster showed the Jeju Air plane landing at Muan International Airport's runway, with smoke streaming out from the engines, before the entire aircraft was quickly engulfed in flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation," Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee had earlier warned that "the tally could rise due to the critically injured".
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident took place at 9.03am local time (0003 GMT) on Sunday during the landing of Jeju Air Flight 2216, the Ministry of Land said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A total of 175 passengers -- including two Thai nationals -- and six crew members were onboard," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air apologised and vowed to do all it could to help.

  <br>
  "We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident. We sincerely apologise for causing concern," the airline said in a statement posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok called for the mobilisation of all resources to save the passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All related agencies... must mobilise all available resources to save the personnel," he instructed officials in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi convened an emergency meeting with cabinet members to discuss rescue operations and response, his office said, adding that the acting president, who took office only on Friday, is on his way to Muan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed deep condolences to the families of those affected by the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said in a social media post that she had ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide assistance immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first fatal accident in the history of Jeju Air, one of South Korea's largest low-cost carriers, which was set up in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  On August 12, 2007, a Bombardier Q400 operated by Jeju Air carrying 74 passengers came off the runway due to strong winds at the southern Busan-Gimhae airport, resulting in a dozen injuries. (AFP, AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A prototype of the CR450 bullet train that will run at 400 kilometres per hour made its debut in Beijing on Sunday, said the country's railway operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Railway said the train, which has a sleek, bullet-shaped nose and resembles an arrow when viewed from the side, is capable of running at a top speed of 450 kilometres per hour during trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s tipped to become the world’s fastest commercial train when it starts operations next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said the train can essentially cut travel time from Beijing to Shanghai from the current four hours, to just 2.5 hours.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norwegian police said an officer in his twenties and a suspect had died after an overnight shootout on Saturday in the Nordic nation where police rarely die in the line of duty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The last time a police officer was shot and killed in the line of duty in Norway dated back to 2004, according to the Norwegian news broadcaster NRK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's deadly shooting took place in Klepp near the city of Stavanger in southwest Norway, and also resulted in another officer being wounded, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mission last night had the worst possible outcome. Two human lives have been lost and the police have lost a dear colleague," said police commissioner Marie Benedicte Bjornland in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the ultimate and most tragic consequence of police work," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police had been alerted to reports of a threatening situation involving weapons after midnight on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two police officers and the suspected gunman in his forties, who was sitting in a car, were shot in the subsequent exchange of gunfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critically injured, one of the police officers and the suspected man died on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fatal shootings of police officers are extremely rare in Norway and the other Nordic nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very serious and tragic event that affects us all", said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store to NRK. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the WHO and health officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility "useless", further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Health Organisation said the operation had put the "last major health facility in north Gaza out of service."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid," it added in a statement on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remained in the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the UN health agency said, adding it was "deeply concerned for their safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces had detained Kamal Adwan's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. (AFP)

    EU universal charger rules come into force

<img alt="Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, had been slow to comply. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785316_1_20241228205033.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 EU rules requiring all new smartphones, tablets and cameras to use the same charger came into force on Saturday, in a change Brussels said will cut costs and waste.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manufacturers are now obliged to fit devices sold in the 27-nation bloc with a USB-C, the port chosen by the European Union as the common standard for charging electronic tools.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting today, all new mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, headphones, speakers, keyboards and many other electronics sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB Type-C charging port," the EU Parliament wrote on social media X.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU has said the single charger rule will simplify the lives of Europeans and slash costs for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  By allowing consumers to purchase a new device without a new charger, it will also reduce the mountain of obsolete chargers, the bloc has argued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law was first approved in 2022 following a tussle with US tech giant Apple. It allowed companies until December 28 this year to adapt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of laptops will have extra time, from early 2026, to also follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most devices already use these cables, but Apple was more than a little reluctant.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said in 2021 that such regulation "stifles innovation", but by September last year it had begun shipping phones with the new port.
  <br>
  <br>
  Makers of electronic consumer items in Europe had agreed on a single charging norm from dozens on the market a decade ago under a voluntary agreement with the European Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Apple, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, refused to abide by it and ditch its Lightning ports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other manufacturers kept their alternative cables going, meaning there were about half a dozen types knocking around, creating a jumble of cables for consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  USB-C ports can charge at up to 100 Watts, transfer data up to 40 gigabits per second, and be used to hook up to external displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time of its approval, the commission said the law was expected to save at least 200 million euros (US$208 million) per year and cut more than a thousand tonnes of EU electronic waste every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for THE charger," the European Commission wrote on X on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means better charging technology, reduced e-waste, and less fuss to find the chargers you need." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia warned on Saturday of severe environmental damage from a huge oil spill in the Black Sea caused when two tankers collided in a storm near Crimea, which declared a state of emergency.
 <br>
  <br>
  One tanker sank and another ran aground on December 15 in the Kerch Strait between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of volunteers have been mobilised for clean-up operations that have been criticised as insufficient by some Russian scientists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tankers were carrying 9,200 tonnes of fuel oil, around 40 percent of which may have spilled into the sea, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation is truly critical," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, quoted by Russian press agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is unfortunately impossible to calculate for the moment the extent of the environmental damage but specialists are working regularly on it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksionov, said on Telegram he had declared a state of emergency "because of the oil products spill in the Kerch Strait."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's transport ministry insisted on Saturday that "all polluted aquatic areas that have been identified have been cleaned" and "no recurring pollution has been detected."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Kurenkov was more cautious, saying: "The threat of a new fuel oil leak in the Black Sea from the tankers and spills on the coast persists."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Vladimir Putin earlier this month called the oil spill an "ecological disaster." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Air travellers in Britain faced further disruption on Saturday, as fog that has blanketed much of the country in recent days grounded flights and hampered landings and take-offs.
 <br>
  <br>
  London Gatwick airport was most affected, according to aircraft tracking website Flightradar24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Various airports saw disruption on Friday, including Manchester and the country's busiest hub, Heathrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As widespread fog continues to affect some UK airports today, temporary air traffic restrictions remain in place at locations with low visibility," the air traffic control authority NATS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the restrictions were to maintain safety and that its teams were working closely with the airports and airlines to minimise disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In some areas, thick fog patches could reduce visibility down to just 100 metres, Britain's weather agency, the Met Office, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for Gatwick Airport said the temporary air traffic restrictions in place due to fog causing poor visibility could lead to delays "throughout the day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The disruption comes at one of the busiest times of the year for air travel. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown delivered a 44-point gem as the NBA champion Boston Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak with a 142-105 blowout of the Indiana Pacers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brown set the tone with 15 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics out-scored the Pacers 39-22 to take control.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished with six of the Celtics' 23 three-pointers and came up with four steals, posting his highest scoring output since he scored 50 in a win over Orlando in January 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was big-time," Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Brown, who energised the TD Garden crowd with an array of thunderous dunks. "He has the ability to impact a team and an arena with his energy and his physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he gets into a certain zone he just gets locked in, and you kind of saw that on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 22 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Payton Pritchard added 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists off the bench for the Celtics, who shrugged off the absence of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday to post their biggest points total of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Bennedict Mathurin scored 18 for the Pacers, who were without injured Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lopsided win over the team they vanquished in last season's Eastern Conference finals saw the Celtics avoid their first three-game skid of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also kept them in touch with Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who improved their league-best record to 27-4 with a 149-135 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to lead six Cavaliers players in double figures as Cleveland won their sixth straight – and their 10th in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs drilled 23 three-pointers and led by as many as 21, withstanding a triple-double of 27 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Houston, where Minnesota's Anthony Edwards drilled a step-back three-pointer with 23.2 seconds remaining to lift the Timberwolves to a 113-112 victory over the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet had a chance to win it for Houston, but missed a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 27 points and Edwards finished with 24 for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 16 points, 106-90, with 4:57 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made it happen!" Edwards said. "Got some stops, we made some big shots – made a big shot at the end right there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 38 points and 12 rebounds. Amen Thompson added 20 points as all five Houston starters scored in double figures only to come up short at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks pushed their winning streak to six games with a convincing 108-85 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 26 points and handed out nine assists and Josh Hart added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who made just four of their 15 three-point attempts but converted 24 of their 34 free-throw attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic, with top contributors Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner on the injured list, were led by 27 points from Jalen Suggs.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama delivered 19 points and seven rebounds as the Spurs heated up in the second half to beat the Nets 96-87 in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs connected on just 11 of their 40 shot attempts in the first half and were tied 41-41 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They broke it open in the third quarter, connecting on 13 of their 18 shots. Wembanyama made four of his five attempts in the period, including three three-pointers, as the Spurs seized a 74-62 lead going into the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Indian state funeral for former PM Manmohan Singh

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 India on Saturday accorded former premier Manmohan Singh, one of the architects of the country's economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, a state funeral with full military honours, complete with a gun salute.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singh, who held office from 2004 to 2014, died at the age of 92 on Thursday, after which seven days of state mourning were declared.
  <br>
  <br>
  The honours were led by President Draupadi Murmu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance, along with the country's top civilian and military officials. Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck also attended the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who called the former prime minister his mentor and guide, joined Singh's family as they prayed before his cremation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, mourners gathered to pay their respects to Singh. His coffin, draped in garlands of flowers, was flanked by a guard of honour and carried to his Congress Party headquarters in New Delhi.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was then taken through the capital to the cremation grounds, accompanied by guards of soldiers and accorded full state honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi called Singh one of India's "most distinguished leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden called Singh a "true statesman," saying that he "charted pathbreaking progress that will continue to strengthen our nations – and the world – for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former prime minister was an understated technocrat who was hailed for overseeing an economic boom in his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's second stint ended with a series of major corruption scandals, slowing growth and high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh's unpopularity in his second term, and lacklustre leadership by Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi, the current opposition leader in the lower house, led to Modi's first landslide victory in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1932 in the mud-house village of Gah in what is now Pakistan and was then British-ruled India, Singh studied economics to find a way to eradicate poverty in the vast nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won scholarships to attend both Cambridge, where he obtained a first in economics, and Oxford, where he completed his doctorate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singh worked in a string of senior civil service posts, served as a central bank governor and also held various jobs with global agencies including the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was tapped in 1991 by then Congress prime minister PV Narasimha Rao to serve as finance minister and reel India back from the worst financial crisis in its modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though he had never held an elected post, he was declared the National Congress's candidate for the highest office in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first term, Singh steered the economy through a period of nine percent growth, lending India the international clout it had long sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also sealed a landmark nuclear deal with the United States that he said would help India meet its growing energy needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Murmu said Singh would "always be remembered for his service to the nation, his unblemished political life and his utmost humility." (AFP)

    'Yoon authorised shooting during martial law bid'

<img alt='According to a prosecution indictment report, troops trying to enter the National Assembly on December 3 were told to get in quickly, "even if it means shooting." Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785298_1_20241228161211.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol authorised the military to fire their weapons if needed to enter parliament during his failed bid to impose martial law, according to a prosecutors' report.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 10-page summary from former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun's prosecution indictment report, which was provided to the media, also says Yoon vowed on December 3 to declare martial law three times if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, who was stripped of his duties by the National Assembly this month, is under investigation for his short-lived attempt to scrap civilian rule, which plunged the country into political turmoil and led to his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun dismissed the prosecutors' report, saying it was "a one-sided account that neither corresponds to objective circumstances nor common sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  As lawmakers rushed to parliament on December 3 to vote down Yoon's martial law declaration, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the prosecution indictment report, Yoon told the chief of the capital defence command, Lee Jin-woo, that military forces could shoot if necessary to enter the National Assembly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Have you still not got in? What are you doing? Break down the door and drag them out, even if it means shooting," Yoon told Lee, according to the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also allegedly told the head of the Defence Counterintelligence Command, General Kwak Jong-keun, to "quickly get inside" the National Assembly since the quorum for the martial law declaration to be lifted had not been met.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So quickly get inside the National Assembly and bring out the people inside the chamber, and break down the doors with an axe if necessary and drag everyone out," the report quotes Yoon as saying at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After lawmakers rushed inside parliament and voted 190-0 to nullify Yoon's declaration in the early hours of December 4, the report says Yoon told Lee, "Even if it's lifted, I can declare martial law a second or third time, so just keep going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also included screenshots of senior defence officials' messages from the day of the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said there was evidence that Yoon had been discussing declaring martial law with senior military officials as early as March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The declaration followed a budget tussle between Yoon's party and the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days later, Yoon said in a speech that he apologised for the "anxiety and inconvenience" and promised that there would not be a second declaration of martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ex-defence minister Kim was arrested this month over his role in the failed martial law bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Kang Sun-woo said in a statement on Saturday that "the prosecution has laid bare the undeniable ugly truth about Yoon Suk Yeol, the treasonous ringleader," adding that he must be "arrested immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday, with the suspended president's legal team attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will also decide the fate of Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, who was impeached on Friday over his refusal to complete Yoon's impeachment process and bring him to justice. (AFP)

    Reddy's defiant maiden ton claws India back into Test

<img alt="Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrates after passing 100 on day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785295_1_20241228154625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nitish Kumar Reddy scored a defiant maiden century on Saturday as India fought back to reach 358-9 on a rain-hit third day of the fourth Test against Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rising all-rounder Reddy was applauded off the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 105 not out after rain ended play for the day midway through the final session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having provided much-needed stability to another shaky Indian batting effort, the 21-year-old will resume on Sunday alongside Mohammed Siraj, on two, with the first-innings deficit reduced to 116 runs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's push for a much bigger advantage after scoring 474 was stymied by Reddy and spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar, who scored 50 as the pair put on 127 for the eighth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the roar of a large contingent of Indian supporters among a record 83,073 third-day crowd at the MCG, Reddy lofted Scott Boland over mid-on to reach three figures just before play was halted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an innings memorable for resolute defence, mixed with classical strokeplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reddy faced 176 balls, hitting 10 fours and one six, continuing the fine batting form that has marked his debut series.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first six Test innings, he has scored 284 runs at an average of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Pat Cummins with 3-86 were the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered little assistance despite overcast skies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recalled Sundar's dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at first slip by Steve Smith from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended a partnership that traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from 164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sundar survived the most freakish moment of the day when on 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempting to flick a leg-sided delivery from Mitchell Starc, the ball flew from the back of the bat into the slip cordon where a diving Smith spilled a one-handed opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the opening session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pant's innings of 28 ended when he over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, top-edging the ball to third man where Lyon held the catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 83,073 was a record for the third day of a Boxing Day Test, according to Cricket Australia, and the largest day three crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1937.
  <br>
  <br>
  The record total attendance for a Boxing Day Test is 271,865, which looks certain to be smashed on Sunday after 255,462 spectators came through the gates on the first three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain threatened throughout the day and about 40 minutes of play was lost in a period either side of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The series is locked at 1-1 with the fifth and final Test to be played in Sydney next week. (AFP)

    Arsenal edge Ipswich to go second in Premier League

<img alt="Kai Havertz got the only goal but should have had two as Arsenal moved up to second. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785293_1_20241228143656.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal began life without Bukayo Saka by beating Ipswich 1-0 to move into second place in the English Premier League and cut Liverpool's lead to six points on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal failed to turn their dominance into a more convincing scoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may ultimately cost Mikel Arteta's men a first league title in more than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool's closest challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka is set to be sidelined for "many weeks" in the words of Gunners' boss Arteta with fears the England international could be out until March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend's 5-1 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta's solution was to start with Gabriel Martinelli in Saka's normal role wide right with Gabriel Jesus continuing up front after scoring five times in Arsenal's previous two outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were dominant in possession but had few clear-cut chances to show for it until the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were frustrated by Everton in a 0-0 draw in their last league game at the Emirates so there was relief when Havertz broke the deadlock on 23 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German prodded high into the net from Leandro Trossard's low cross for his 12th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus did find the net once more with a cheeky finish between the legs of Arijanet Muric from an almost impossible angle, but was flagged offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces has been well-documented and they should have added to their goals from corners this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes headed against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it seemed easier to score.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Ipswich's ambition grew as the second half wore on, so the chances at the other end began to flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard had given the home crowd a scare by going down holding the left ankle that saw him sidelined by injury for two months earlier in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arsenal captain, though, was quickly back on his feet and weaving his way through the Ipswich defence with a mazy run and powerful strike that Muric tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the resulting corner, Declan Rice's powerful shot was blocked by Dara O'Shea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz then wasted a glorious chance for his second and Muric saved once more from Mikel Merino to ensure a nervy ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal held out to leapfrog Nottingham Forest and Chelsea into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich remain second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton missed the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls are now winless in their past six games but they remain two points above their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had the ball in the net early on through Yoane Wissa but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just Brentford's second point away from home all season is enough to edge the Bees ahead of Tottenham into 11th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One Mega Millions player has plenty of dough to ring in the New Year after drawing the winning number. After three months without anyone winning the top prize, a ticket worth an estimated US$1.22 billion was sold for the drawing on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winner matched the white balls 3, 7, 37, 49, 55 and the gold Mega Ball 6. The identity of the winner was not immediately known.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total amount of the Mega Millions jackpot would only be distributed to a winner who chooses an annuity paid over 29 years. Nearly all grand prize winners opt to take a cash payout, which for Friday night’s drawing is an estimated US$549.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the game’s long odds of 1 in 302.6 million, players continued to purchase tickets as the size of the grand prize grew. Until Friday, the last time a Mega Millions player hit the top prize was September 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot ticket worth US$1.6 billion was sold in Florida in August 2023. Two prizes for its compatriot Powerball lottery have been larger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mega Millions and Powerball are sold in 45 states, as well as Washington DC, and the US Virgin Islands. Powerball also is sold in Puerto Rico. (AP)

 The chairman of the Quality Tourism Services Association on Saturday reassured the catering and retail sectors that they will still have business as long as they grasp the new consumption habits of mainland tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme, Simon Wong pointed out that the industries should not expect mainland visitors to fork out as much as they used to.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed that compared to the peak of pre-Covid times, the spend for each mainland tourist who stays overnight has reduced by HK$3,000 in retail, which is the greatest among all sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said this might not be due to weaker consumption power among mainlanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The catering and retail industries should start to accept that the so-called weakening spending power of tourists from the mainland might only be them normalising their spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe we should not fantasise that their spending will be doubled within a short period of time, to be as high as in the past. It might be because their consumption power was particularly strong at that time, and it is only now normalising."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the market will not be booming, he said there will still be business for the catering and retail industries if they recognise such changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Wong estimated that businesses have surged up to 20 percent month-on-month during the Christmas holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has dropped by 10 percent compared to a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents has also boosted the economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

    International driving permit kiosks to be launched

<div class="itemFullText">
 Self-service kiosks where the public can apply for international driving permits will soon be up and running at two locations in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said they can be found at two licensing offices, in Admiralty and Cheung Sha Wan, from January 13, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be a daily quota of around 32 applications per kiosk, and  drivers can make reservations from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department's CEO of licensing, Chow Wai, said the application process will now be easier for the public with the two kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can get their permit within the same day or within an hour after submitting the application. If they use the non-counter means - [applying] online, [via] drop-in box, or by post, usually it would take up to ten working days to send the permit to the applicants," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the benefits of using the kiosk is that they can save waiting time to get the permit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said drivers need an iAM Smart+ account, with a digital signing function of a valid personal digital certificate, to use the kiosks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that authorities will look into whether more licensing offices can introduce self-service kiosks.

 Technology minister Sun Dong said that the business community has a key role to play in Hong Kong's pursuit of becoming an innovation and technology hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  He told an RTHK radio programme on Saturday that I&T is crucial in attaining economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the development of the I&T sector, it is without a doubt that the government will play an important leading role, but the government alone is not enough. The whole of society has to participate," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, the government's major challenge ahead is how to unite all sectors, particularly business, to boost the development of I&T in the coming five to ten years."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that the government will roll out land preferential measures to attract businesses to set up production lines in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has been conducting talks with relevant organisations, such as the Science Park, and he hopes the policies can be introduced in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The measures will focus on attracting strategic enterprises to set up factories, production lines as well as actual production facilities and links that can create value to Hong Kong's economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, apart from providing them land at an attractive price, we will also require these companies to have a certain value of output and return to society within a certain period."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also pointed out that the first three buildings of the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, are expected to be launched next year, adding that leasing arrangements are underway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone that spans across the Shenzhen River consists of 87-hectare Hong Kong Park, and 300-hectare Shenzhen Park.

    US homelessness hits new record in 2024: report

 The number of people in the United States experiencing homelessness reached a new record this year, with lingering inflation and high housing prices among likely drivers, a government report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 771,480 people were homeless on a single night in January 2024, rising 18 percent from 2023, said the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an annual assessment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This translates to about 23 in every 10,000 people in the country, home to the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uptick came as households felt the pressure from housing costs, with the median rent for January 2024 being 20 percent higher than that in January 2021, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from housing costs, the HUD report flagged "stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households, and the persisting effects of systemic racism" as other factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other contributing issues included natural disasters that displaced people, rising immigration and an end to homelessness prevention programs introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While this data is nearly a year old, and no longer reflects the situation we are seeing, it is critical that we focus on evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness," said HUD agency head Adrianne Todman in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night this year, a 33 percent jump over 2023, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children under the age of 18 were the age group seeing the biggest surge in homelessness between 2023 and 2024. (AFP)
