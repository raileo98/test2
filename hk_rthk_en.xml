<img alt="Kaja Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781619_1_20241201173234.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's new foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Sunday warned Georgian authorities over violence against demonstrators protesting the government's decision to shelve its bid to join the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is clear that using violence against peaceful protesters is not acceptable, and the Georgian government should respect the will of the Georgian people," Kallas told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When it comes to European Union, then this clearly has consequences on our relationship with Georgia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas, who took office on Sunday with a visit to Ukraine, said "options" had been put forward to the EU's 27 member states on how to respond, including potentially imposing sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have different options. But of course, we need to come to agreement," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, AFP reporters witnessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chaotic scenes unfolded for hours as police chased defiant protesters through the streets of central Tbilisi, beating them and making arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masked officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said "the actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent" and that police would "respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation".
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 people have been arrested in the last two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. (AFP)

    Offer public housing to more non-elderly singles: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo says non-elderly one-person applicants of public housing often have to wait for more than 10 years to be assigned a flat.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group on Sunday called on the government to allow more non-elderly single people to get public housing.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), about 91,000 non-elderly one-person applicants were waiting to be allocated a public housing unit as of September.
  <br>
  <br>
  A maximum of 2,200 units, or about 10 percent of new public housing units made available, are allocated to them each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy director of SoCo Sze Lai-shan said that should be raised to up to 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now the government use age in the points system when they [applicants] are waiting for public housing, and the quota for non-elderly persons is very low," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government should suspend the points system, and increase the quota allocated to non-elderly single people so it is more fair for them, maybe at least to 20 or 30 percent. It would be more fair and not affect families and elderlies too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the average waiting time for public housing units is 5.5 years, Sze said that did not include non-elderly one-person applicants who often have to wait for more than 10 years before being assigned a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 57-year-old man surnamed Suen, who rents a cubicle apartment, said he has been on the waiting list for 16 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four years ago I was 20 points short [on the points system] to be allocated a flat, two years ago I was still 20 points short, and recently I still find myself missing 20 points. How long do I still have to live in this apartment?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No government subsidies are available, and we have to wait longer for public housing, and we are also not eligible to apply for light public housing," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also called on the government to include non-elderly one-person applicants in a cash allowance scheme for those who have been on the public housing waiting list for at least three years.

    Make every dollar count, says audit director

<img alt="Director of Audit Nelson Lam says the Audit Commission will focus more on checking public organisations and funds in the future. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781597_2_20241201154734.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Government departments and public organisations should take the lead in cutting cost and increasing revenue in light of a budget deficit, the director of audit said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Nelson Lam noted there is less corruption in the public sector these days, and government workers are being more careful with spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said the Audit Commission will therefore focus more on public organisations and funds going forward, especially when it comes to big projects involving a lot of public money.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been looking at whether spending is economical or not. In fact, we will pay more attention to larger expenditures and those involving more public funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, under the Innovation and Technology Commission, bearing the cost of the allowance beyond the permitted amount incurred in some business trips as revealed by the latest audit report, Lam said that affected the government's overall expenditure and image.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's quite surprising. I find it strange why people still make these kinds of mistakes. But I want to emphasise one thing – I hope all public servants understand that when you work in public service, it should be for the public good, not for personal gain," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam also said future audit work may require cross-border data sharing because of greater cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, including the expansion of elderly healthcare vouchers to mainland cities.

    'Stranded whale might be hurt before entering HK'

<div class="itemFullText">
 An injured whale that died after being stranded in Tai O might have been hurt or fallen sick before entering Hong Kong waters, a marine conservationist said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, believed it could be a rare Longman's beaked whale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even before the whale entered Hong Kong waters, it could be sick and got lost, that's why it's found in Hong Kong waters. It's very possible that the whale had some kind of disease or got injured by other reasons," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department had activated a response plan to rescue the whale after it was sighted in the waters near Tai O on Saturday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we saw the animal near the evening time in Hong Kong, the animal was already very weak and did not behave normally," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the whale, with a wound on its body, was found to be extremely weak during sedation administered for further diagnosis, and it subsequently died in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang also said the conditions were unfavourable for the stranded cetacean to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the residents in Tai O first saw this animal, the tide was very low. That's why when we saw a lot of photos or videos online, the animal was mostly stranded almost on the sand or on land already.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It made the situation very difficult for the animal, even if the animal had the ability to swim," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A necropsy will be carried out on Sunday to determine the cause of death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has pledged to work with Hong Kong in leveraging the advantages of the two SARs to foster development.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On whether we and Hong Kong could complement each other's strengths and foster mutual development, I think there's huge potential in this," Sam said in a press conference on Sunday flanked by his incoming cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will meet with Chief Executive John Lee after he assumes office on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After I take office, I'll talk to Chief Executive John Lee about how the two SARs can – on each side of the Pearl River and under our common constitutional and political system – fully leverage our respective advantages to foster development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll also look at how we can leverage our strengths and seek opportunities, while integrating into the nation's development, as we strive for achievements for both SARs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam and his governing team met the media a day after Beijing approved his nominations and appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The formation of this government's principal officials and prosecutor-general embodies the spirit of 'upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground', which completely aligns with the requirements I set out for principal officials," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming Macau leader added his government will respond to issues the public is most concerned about, and work on key tasks relating to the city's long-term development.

    'Obstruction' blocking pact on plastic pollution

<img alt="Environmentalists have demanded stronger commitments to fight plastic waste at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in Busan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781577_1_20241201094724.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries," Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty," said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to fight for an ambitious outcome in Busan," Givernet said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have still a few hours to discuss and make contributions and be certain that our determination (is) to carry on with the negotiation process until the last hour." (AFP)

 Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-2 on Saturday to climb up to second in the Premier League, while Justin Kluivert scored the first ever Premier League hat-trick of penalties in Bournemouth's 4-2 win at Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have struck 13 goals in a week to refind their form and cut the gap to runaway leaders Liverpool, who host struggling defending champions Manchester City in Sunday's blockbuster clash, to six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are back to our best form. We look fluid and dynamic we are all enjoying football right now," said Bukayo Saka, who shone with a goal and two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a top week for us. We have built a lot of momentum and we want to go on to the next few games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal scored four times before the break in a 6-0 rout at the London Stadium last season and went one better this time as all the goals came in a manic first half,
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes' threat from set-pieces is well-known but the Brazilian was inexplicably not picked up to head in Saka's corner on 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka then teed up Leandro Trossard to double the lead before he stepped aside for Martin Odegaard to score Arsenal's third from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz slotted in from Trossard's pass to make 4-0 after just 36 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another heavy home defeat increased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers flickered into life with two goals in two minutes through Aaron Wan-Bissaka and a brilliant Emerson Palmieri free-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Saka restored the three-goal advantage from the spot after Gabriel was felled from another corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made history at Molineux to curtail Wolves' mini-revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were three goals inside eight minutes as the Dutchman opened the scoring, Jorgen Strand Larsen replied for Wolves before Milos Kerkez made it 2-1 for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made it 3-1 just 10 minutes later and completed his hat-trick 16 minutes from time after Evanilson also set a record by winning a third penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was not completely sure I should allow him to take the third one," said Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is difficult, every time you shoot the first one, you give information to the keeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen pulled another goal back for Wolves, but Gary O'Neil's men slip back into the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford continued their stunning home form to thrash Leicester 4-1 in front of the Foxes' in-coming manager Ruud van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facundo Buonanotte had put the visitors in front in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brentford roared back to make it six wins and one draw from seven home league games this season -- the best points return in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa started the comeback before Schade took centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German had only scored two Premier League goals since joining the Bees in 2023 but matched that tally before half-time to put the home side in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schade then rounded off the scoring to show Van Nistelrooy the scale of the task that awaits him ahead of his first game in charge at home to West Ham on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shining star today was Kevin Schade," said Brentford manager Thomas Frank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I celebrated so much his first because I know how hard it's been for him because he's had so many injuries and he's wanting to play in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood's emphatically struck penalty was enough to get Forest back to winning ways and leave Ipswich still in the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace edged out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to late drama in a 1-1 draw against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marc Guehi, who had been the subject of multiple bids from Newcastle during the transfer window, put the Magpies in front early in the second half with an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the England defender redeemed himself as from his cross Daniel Munoz powered home a header at the back post. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A stranded whale has died near Tai O despite efforts by a team of veterinarians to help it.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Sunday that veterinarians from Ocean Park had carried out an initial assessment and found that the whale was injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During sedation administered for further diagnosis, the veterinarians found the whale in extremely weak condition," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the whale subsequently died during the diagnostic procedures at around midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that AFCD staff and Ocean Park vets will examine the carcass to determine the cause of death.

    Gaza rescuers say 3 aid workers die in Israeli strike

<img alt="The car carrying the aid workers was almost completely destroyed by the strike in Khan Younis. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781558_1_20241130221340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said three aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike in the Hamas-run territory on Saturday but the Israeli army said it killed a "terrorist."
 <br>
  <br>
  The agency said the aid workers killed were Palestinian employees of World Central Kitchen (WCK). The US aid group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it had "struck a vehicle with a terrorist that took part in the murderous October 7 massacre," referring to the militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The claim that the terrorist was simultaneously a WCK worker is being examined," it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the bodies of "at least five dead were transported (to hospital), including (those of) the three employees of World Central Kitchen."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All three men worked for WCK and they were hit while driving in a WCK jeep in Khan Younis," Bassal said, adding that the vehicle had been "marked with its logo clearly visible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army insisted its strike in the main southern city hit "a civilian unmarked vehicle and its movement on the route was not coordinated for transporting of aid."
  <br>
  <br>
  In April, an Israeli air strike killed seven WCK staff – an Australian, three Britons, a North American, a Palestinian and a Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had been targeting a "Hamas gunman" in that strike but the military admitted a series of "grave mistakes" and violations of its own rules of engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,207 people, most of them civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed 44,382 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia all but certain to host 2034 World Cup

<img alt="Saudi Arabia is planning massive sports infrastructure projects if its bid is successful. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781554_1_20241130214244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup was considered "medium risk" for human rights by Fifa in its evaluation report, which said implementing reforms could take "significant time and effort."
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the report on Saturday comes ahead of the Fifa Congress on December 11, when a vote will be held to select the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034 while Morocco, Spain and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay all set to host a match as part of the centenary edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid "presents a very strong all-round proposition, reflected in the results of the technical evaluation, which assesses the proposed infrastructure (both sporting and general) as well as its commercial potential," Fifa said in its report.
  <br>
  <br>
  But football's world governing body cautioned, "in terms of human rights, the undertaking involved in implementing the various measures... particularly in certain areas, could involve significant effort and time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifa said that was the basis for the elevated risk rating for a bid that received an average score of 4.2 out of 5 – higher than the combined bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to note that the bid involves significant opportunities for positive human rights impact," added Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is good potential that the tournament could serve as a catalyst for some of the ongoing and future reforms and contribute to positive human rights outcomes for people in Saudi Arabia and the region that go beyond the scope of the tournament itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia has yet to build several proposed stadiums for a tournament that could be held in winter, as was the case in Qatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights, a source of deep controversy at the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar, threatens to become a major talking point once again in the run-up to 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free expression is severely restricted, with some people handed lengthy jail terms over critical posts on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events including Formula One and the WTA Finals tennis, is often accused of "sportswashing" – using sport to divert attention from its rights record. (AFP)

    Serbia denies involvement in Kosovo canal blast

<img alt="Kosovo police guard the site of Friday's explosion. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781556_1_20241130215305.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kosovo stepped up security measures around "critical" infrastructure on Saturday after an explosion at a key canal feeding two of its main power plants, as neighbouring Serbia rejected accusations it had staged the blast.
 <br>
  <br>
  The explosion occurred on Friday near the town of Zubin Potok in a Serb-dominated area in Kosovo's troubled north, damaging the canal supplying water to cooling systems at two coal-fired power plants that generate most of Kosovo's electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Albin Kurti called a security meeting late on Friday, saying: "This is a criminal and terrorist attack aimed at damaging our critical infrastructure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The attack was carried out by professionals. We believe it comes from gangs directed by Serbia," he added without providing any evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government later issued a statement echoing his allegations, saying that "initial indications suggest" the explosion had been "orchestrated by the Serbian state, which has the capacity to carry out such a criminal and terrorist attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kosovo also "approved additional measures to strengthen security around essential infrastructure and services, such as bridges, transformers" and other sites, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbia slapped back on Saturday, condemning the attack, while calling the accusation "premature" and "baseless."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such destructive actions are unacceptable and threaten the fragile stability we are striving to maintain," Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Serbia unequivocally demands responsibility for the perpetrators of this reckless attack," he added, while suggesting the Kosovar "regime" could be behind the blast and calling for an internationally-led investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo, Serb List, also condemned the attack "in the strongest possible terms."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pictures from the scene published by local media showed water leaking heavily from one side of the reinforced canal, which runs from the Serb-majority north of Kosovo to the capital Pristina and also supplies drinking water.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, electricity supplies to consumers were running smoothly on Saturday morning, with authorities having found an alternative method for cooling the plants, Kosovo's Economy Minister Artane Rizvanolli said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Repair work was ongoing, authorities said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa had to overcome determined resistance from Sri Lanka's batsmen before winning the first Test by 233 runs at Kingsmead on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set a massive 516 runs to win, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 282.
  <br>
  <br>
  Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen, the destroyer in Sri Lanka's record-low first innings of 42, took four for 73 to finish with match figures of 11 for 86.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast to the first innings, the tourists made the South Africans work for their wickets on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinesh Chandimal (83) and captain Dhananjaya de Silva (59) put on 95 for the sixth wicket and kept South Africa in the field for most of the morning after resuming at 101 for five.
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough for South Africa came when De Silva chipped a catch to midwicket off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kusal Mendis made an attacking 48 before he became Jansen's 10th victim of the match, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal and De Silva took advantage of the best batting conditions of the match against bowlers who were not as effective as they had been when the ball was shiny and new.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were also without all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, who was ruled out of the rest of the series with a broken finger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal, who was 29 not out overnight, continued to defy the bowlers on the ground where he marked his Test debut with two half-centuries 13 years ago. He made his 83 off 174 balls before being caught and bowled by Gerald Coetzee. (AFP)

    Greenpeace activists board tanker in plastic protest

Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781548_1_20241130190810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Greenpeace activists boarded a tanker off South Korea on Saturday in an action intended to draw attention to calls for a treaty to curb plastic pollution, the environmental group said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 200 countries are in Busan to negotiate the deal, but there is little sign of agreement with just a day left before talks are due to end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greenpeace said the tanker Buena Alba, anchored off the Hanwha TotalEnergies complex, was scheduled to pick up propylene, which is used to manufacture plastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The activists boarded the vessel peacefully and met no reaction from the vessel crew," said Greenpeace spokeswoman Angelica Pago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We painted 'PLASTIC KILLS' on the side of the vessel and the climbers successfully set up a camp," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They intend to stay in order to continue putting pressure on the negotiators to resist fossil fuel and petrochemical industry interference in the talks and to deliver a treaty that firmly cuts plastic production."
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman for South Korea's coast guard said police had been "deployed on the ship, and we are making warning announcements to facilitate a safe disembarkation."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a "thorough investigation" would be carried out to determine if there were any "illegal elements" to the protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempts to reach an agreement on curbing plastic pollution have stalled over several key sticking points, including whether to cut new plastic production.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of countries, backed by environmental groups, insist a treaty without production cuts will fail to solve the problem, but a group of largely oil-producing states is fiercely opposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The brave activists that boarded that vessel today show the courage and should inspire governments here to hold the line and do what everyone knows is obvious," Greenpeace delegation head Graham Forbes told reporters in Busan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The negotiations have reached a "pivotal moment," he said, but "a handful of governments... are looking backwards and refusing to take the steps necessary for us all to advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we are at a very risky moment right now of being sold out, and that would be an absolute catastrophe," Forbes said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 percent that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, a US$2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices," Sri Lanka's central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 percent in October and 0.5 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected in September, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Georgia on Saturday said 107 people were arrested during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The interior ministry said 107 people were detained for "disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Throughout the night... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles, and metal items, at law enforcement officers," it said, adding that "10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry had said that 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement on Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words, and insisted membership in the bloc "by 2030" remains his "top priority."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, riot police fired water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalised with serious injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president – at loggerheads with the ruling party – said: "The resistance movement has begun... I stand in solidarity with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. (AFP)

<img alt="More than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781545_1_20241130183503.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sectarian feuding in northwest Pakistan killed 13 more people, a local government official said on Saturday, as warring Sunnis and Shi'ites defied repeated ceasefire orders, bringing the total death toll in a recent spasm of violence to 124.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country, but Kurram district – in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the border with Afghanistan – has a large Shi'ite population and the communities have clashed for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh fighting broke out last Thursday when two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling under police escort were ambushed, killing more than 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then 10 days of fighting with light and heavy weapons has brought the region to a standstill, with major roads closed and mobile phone services cut as the death toll surged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Kurram local government official put the death toll at 124 on Saturday after 13 more people were killed in the past two days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two were Sunni and 11 Shi'ite, he said, whilst more than 50 people have been wounded in fresh fighting which continued on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a severe lack of trust between the two sides, and neither tribe is willing to comply with government orders to cease hostilities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police report that many people want to flee the area due to the violence, but the deteriorating security situation makes it impossible," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A seven-day ceasefire deal was announced by the provincial government last weekend but failed to hold. Another 10-day truce was brokered on Wednesday but it also failed to stymie the fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior security official in the provincial capital of Peshawar, also speaking anonymously, confirmed the total death toll of 124.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a fear of more fatalities," he said. "None of the provincial government's initiated measures have been fully implemented to restore peace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have regularly struggled to control violence in Kurram, which was part of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas until it was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 79 people had been killed in the region between July and October in sectarian clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The feuding is generally rekindled by disputes over land in the rugged mountainous region, and fuelled by underlying tensions between the communities adhering to different sects of Islam. (AFP)

    Floods displace 122,000 people in Malaysia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 122,000 people have been forced out of their homes as massive floods caused by relentless rains swept through Malaysia's northern states, disaster officials said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number surpassed the 118,000 displaced during one of the country's worst floodings in 2014, and disaster officials feared it could rise further as there was no let-up in the torrential downpours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll remained at four recorded across Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelantan state bore the brunt of the flooding, accounting for 63 percent of the 122,631 people displaced, according to data from the National Disaster Management Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were nearly 35,000 people evacuated in Terengganu, with the rest of the displacements reported from seven other states.
  <br>
  <br>
  Heavy rains, which began early this week, continued to hammer Pasir Puteh town in Kelantan, where people could be seen walking through streets inundated with hip-deep waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My area has been flooded since Wednesday. The water has already reached my house corridor and is just two inches away from coming inside," said Pasir Puteh resident and school janitor Zamrah Majid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luckily, I moved my two cars to higher ground before the water level rose."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she allowed her grandchildren to play in the water in front of her house because it was still shallow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the water gets higher, it would be dangerous, I'm afraid they might get swept away," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't received any assistance yet, whether it's welfare or other kinds of help."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muhammad Zulkarnain, 27, who is living with his parents in Pasir Puteh, said they were isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no way in or out of for any vehicles to enter my neighbourhood," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I'm scared... Luckily we have received some assistance from NGOs, they gave us food supplies like biscuits, instant noodles, and eggs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of emergency services personnel have been deployed in flood-prone states along with rescue boats, four-wheel-drive vehicles and helicopters, said Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who chairs the National Disaster Management Committee. (AFP)

    Syria war monitor says rebels control 'most of' Aleppo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A monitor of Syria's war said on Saturday that jihadist rebels now control a majority of Aleppo city, reporting Russian air strikes on parts of Syria's second city for the first time since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied factions... took control of most of the city and government centres and prisons," said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, referring to a jihadist alliance led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria branch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syrian jihadist rebels have pressed a lightning offensive against forces of the Iranian- and Russian-backed Syrian government since Wednesday, the same day a fragile ceasefire took effect in neighbouring Lebanon between Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah after two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Russian "warplanes launched raids on areas of Aleppo city for the first time since 2016," added the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  It raised the death toll in days of clashes to 311 – 183 from HTS and allied Turkish-backed factions, 100 soldiers and pro-government forces, as well as 28 civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media reported that four civilians were killed when HTS shelled a student residence in Aleppo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran-backed militias have a heavy presence in the Aleppo region after providing crucial ground support when the Syrian army – backed by Russian air power – recaptured rebel-held areas of the city in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said that "the governor of Aleppo and the police and security branch commanders withdrew from the city centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  The overnight air strikes coincided with "the arrival of large (rebel) military reinforcements" to the area, the Observatory added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau announced on Saturday that starting from next year, the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund will adopt a fixed operation cycle to accept applications thrice annually.
 <br>
  <br>
  This comes as the authority unveiled the enhancement to the fund's operation to boost the sector's development more effectively, as well as promote tourism,
  <br>
  <br>
  A matching grant will be rolled out to encourage organisers to seek commercial funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will also assess the effectiveness of events based on one more criterion - its integration with tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Applicants also need to ensure that events can boost tourism and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority will provide funding for a maximum of four events each round, and it aims to support at most 10 projects each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fund was set up back in April last year. It has so far sponsored 20 large-scale arts and cultural events.

    'Perfect time to develop sports as an industry'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University on Saturday said now is the best time for Hong Kong to develop sports as an industry and that promoting sports arbitration would be crucial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee mentioned in his Policy Address that the government will look into establishing a sports dispute resolution system and promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Lau from the university's Department of Sport, Physical Education and Health said Hong Kong athletes had some great achievements at international events recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city's sports sector had experienced controversial issues, relating to athlete selection mechanisms, sports associations making use of government funds, and compensation for sports injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau urged the government to do more promotion on sports and legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although other regions in Asia have set up institutions for sports arbitration, Hong Kong has advantages in internationalisation and its legal talents," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with mature infrastructures and financial supporting facilities, I believe Hong Kong can finish strong and become an important place in Asia for sports arbitration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the SAR government lacks systematic planning for sports development, and he urged the authorities to set up long-term plans every five years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 De'Andre Hunter scored 23 points off the bench as the Atlanta Hawks beat league-leading Cleveland again on Friday to advance in the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks, who handed the Cavs their first home defeat of the season on Wednesday, came out on top at home, parlaying a 52-50 halftime lead into a 117-101 triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was enough to put Atlanta into the NBA Cup knockout rounds as winner of their group after the Boston Celtics beat the Bulls 138-129 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 21 points and handed out 11 assists and Jalen Johnson chipped in 20 points for Atlanta, who had six players score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 29 points for Cleveland and Evan Mobley added 24 points for the Cavs, who opened the season on a 15-0 tear and at 17-3 still boast the best record in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks held Cavs star Donovan Mitchell to 12 points and out-scored Cleveland 39-23 in the third quarter to take control for good in the contest that was one of 10 NBA Cup group stage games scheduled on the Thanksgiving holiday on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They outplayed us," Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said after the Cavaliers were held to their lowest points total of the season. "Sometimes you just have to call it like you see it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers, who won the inaugural edition of the Cup last season, were essentially eliminated from the in-season tournament after falling 101-93 to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter for Oklahoma City, draining a three-pointer that put the Thunder up 95-91 with 1:35 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added a pair of free throws and Jalen Williams came up with a steal and a dunk as the Thunder kept the Lakers at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dalton Knecht was the Lakers' top scorer with 20 points. Anthony Davis added 15 and LeBron James scored 12 points but produced five of the Lakers' 17 turnovers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBA champion Celtics, meanwhile, maintained their wildcard hopes with their win over the Bulls – who came into their game fighting the Hawks for group supremacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 35 points and pulled down 14 rebounds and reserve Payton Pritchard scored 19 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to help Boston pull away in a see-saw battle that featured 14 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis scored 21 points apiece for the Celtics while Nikola Vucevic led the Bulls with 32 points and 11 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks, buoyed by Jalen Brunson's fourth-quarter heroics, improved to 3-0 in Cup play with a 99-98 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hornets challenged despite missing five of their top six scorers, with LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Tre Mann, Grant Williams, Mark Williams and Nick Richards all sidelined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Outside looking in, you're thinking they've got some key guys out, so this is supposed to be an easy game. That's not how the NBA works," New York's Josh Hart told reporters after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson scored 11 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter, draining a pair of free throws with 8.6 seconds left that pushed New York's lead to four points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win left the Knicks tied atop their group with Orlando, who beat the Brooklyn Nets 123-100. The Knicks and Magic will face off for the group crown on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franz Wagner scored 29 points with eight rebounds and eight assists to fuel the Magic in their fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 19 points for Orlando, who had little trouble with a Nets team missing top-scorer Dennis Schroder – who was absent for personal reasons – and injured playmaker Cam Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Minnesota Timberwolves halted their four-game losing streak with a 93-92 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards connected on just seven of 21 shots from the field but led the Timberwolves with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a terrible game tonight," said Edwards, adding that Minnesota's defence carried the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively I think we dominated the game," he said. (AFP)

    Thailand flooding kills nine, displaces thousands

<div class="itemFullText">
 Flooding driven by heavy rains in southern Thailand has killed nine people and displaced more than 13,000, officials said on Saturday, as rescue teams using boats and jet skis worked to reach stranded residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media footage showed residents wading through murky, chest-deep water and cars submerged in flooded streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flooding across eight provinces in southern Thailand has affected 553,921 households and claimed nine lives, prompting agencies to mobilise urgent assistance," the country's disaster agency said on its official Facebook page.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 13,000 people had been forced to flee their homes, with temporary shelters set up in schools and temples, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nampa, a resident of coastal Songkhla province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS she was concerned about the dwindling food supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are doing fine now, but I am not sure how long can we stay in this condition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two hospitals in nearby Pattani province suspended operations to prevent floodwaters from damaging medical facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  In neighbouring north Malaysia, the rains have forced the evacuation of at least 80,000 people to temporary shelters this week, with disaster officials there saying at least four people have been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai Meteorological Department has warned that "very heavy rain" could continue to affect some areas of the country's south through next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated 50 million baht (US$1.7 million) in flood relief for each province.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Friday on social media platform X that the goal was to "restore normalcy as quickly as possible."

    British MPs advance contentious assisted dying law

<img alt="Campaigners in favour of assisted dying celebrate the bill progressing to the next stage. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781521_1_20241130143822.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK lawmakers voted on Friday in favour of assisted dying for terminally ill people in England and Wales, advancing the emotive and contentious legislation to the next stage of parliamentary scrutiny.
 <br>
  <br>
  MPs voted by 330 to 275 in support of legalised euthanasia in the first vote on the issue in the House of Commons for nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result came following an emotionally-charged debate that lasted almost five hours in a packed and hushed chamber, and as competing protesters made their voices heard outside parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill now progresses to the committee stage where lawmakers can table amendments, a process likely to be vexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legislation would then face further votes in the Commons and House of Lords upper chamber. The process will likely take months and if it is ultimately passed then a change in the law is expected to be several years away.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House of Commons last debated, and defeated, a euthanasia bill in 2015, but public support for giving terminally ill people the choice to end their lives has since shifted in favour, polls show.
  <br>
  <br>
  A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who is behind the bill, told the debate that changing the law would give terminally ill people "choice, autonomy and dignity at the end of their lives."
  <br>
  <br>
  Advocates also argue that it would make some deaths less painful.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other MPs expressed concern that people might feel coerced into opting for euthanasia, while some said they were worried it would discriminate against people with disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opponents also worry that the healthcare system is not ready for such a landmark change and that it could cause a decline in investment for palliative care.
  <br>
  <br>
  "True dignity consists in being cared for to the end," Conservative MP Danny Kruger said, urging colleagues to reject a "state suicide service."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, dozens of opponents gathered holding signs with "Kill the Bill, not the ill" and "Care not killing," urging MPs to vote against the proposed legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nearby gathering in favour of the legislation saw people dressed in pink holding placards with slogans such as: "My life, my death, my choice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Assisted suicide currently carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Scotland, which has a separate legal system and devolved powers to set its own health policy, it is not a specific criminal offence. But it can leave a person open to other charges, including murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of fewer than six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any patient's wish to die would have to be signed off by a judge and two doctors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures are stricter than assisted dying laws in other European countries and also proposed legislation being contemplated in France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consideration is being given to a similar bill in Scotland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leadbeater's initiative is a so-called private members' bill and is not part of the government's agenda, although it follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's vow, before winning power in July, to allow parliament to revisit the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  MPs had a free vote, meaning predicting the outcome was virtually impossible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer, who voted in favour of permitting assisted suicide in 2015 with "robust" safeguards, did not reveal his view in the run-up to the vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  His ministerial team had been instructed to remain neutral but several expressed views, both in support and against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two polls last week indicated that a majority of Britons back changing the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faith leaders are among the stringent opponents, with nearly 30 signing a joint letter last weekend arguing they are "deeply concerned" by the plans. (AFP)

    HK well-prepared for multi-entry travellers: minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said on Saturday that staff at border control points are well-prepared to handle a surge in travellers in the wake of Beijing's decision to restore multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The multi-entry visa scheme will resume from Sunday, and the maximum length of each visit will be seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was scrapped in 2015 at the request of the SAR government due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Tang said the scheme's resumption is expected to benefit about 10 million people, and the government will ensure that residents will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Border control points may be under pressure, but our staff are well-prepared, and they'll minimise leave and they'll open all the counters, to ensure there's enough manpower," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Customs and police officers will step up patrols at places where a lot of people tended to shop in the past... Similar efforts will be made at tourist spots, to ensure that visitors have a good time, while not affecting our residents."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the government had discussions with the mainland authorities on extending the opening hours of control points on New Year's Eve, to ensure travellers could return to the mainland after countdown celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, echoed Tang's comments and downplayed the likelihood of parallel trading being an issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believes the scheme will boost several sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially with Christmas around the corner, Hong Kong has more of a Christmas vibe than the mainland, which has attracted lots of teenagers there to come and enjoy the festivities here," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with all these factors, generally speaking, the scheme will have a very positive effect on visitor numbers and on businesses between Christmas and Lunar New Year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted that the catering and retail industries are already poised to provide high-quality service and encourage visitors to open their wallets.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the retail sector, in particular, has more work to do on attracting more tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The retail sector, in particular, has to offer things with Hong Kong characteristics. It may not be about the product, but the service they provide has to allow travellers to enjoy a different shopping experience from the one they have on the mainland. These experiences are also important."

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

    VAR breaks Southampton hearts in Brighton

<img alt="Southampton's Flynn Downes celebrates scoring the visitors' first goal against Brighton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781500_1_20241130095714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton were denied victory by a controversial VAR decision in a 1-1 draw at high-flying Brighton on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flynn Downes had just cancelled out Kaoru Mitoma's opener for Brighton when Cameron Archer thought he had put the Saints 2-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR check of more than four minutes eventually decided Archer was onside but penalised Adam Armstrong, who was offside but did not touch the ball, for interfering with play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton had to settle for a first away point of the season as a result and remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point was enough to lift Brighton up to second on alphabetical order ahead of Manchester City, who face leaders Liverpool in the pick of the weekend's action on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were left to rue not making more of a dominant first-half display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georginio Rutter hit the post and fired another effort wide, while Mitoma wasted a huge chance in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's pressure finally paid off on the half hour mark when Mitoma stooped to head in Tariq Lamptey's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton levelled 13 minutes into the second half with the impressive Tyler Dibling the architect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teenager's square ball teed up Armstrong, whose shot was blocked, but the loose ball found its way to Downes, who hammered home first time from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight minutes later Dibling wriggled clear of three Brighton players inside his own half and then spread the ball to Fraser.
  <br>
  <br>
  His low cross evaded Armstrong and was finished at the far post by Archer - only to be chalked off to the dismay of boss Russell Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm fed up talking about decisions," said Martin.

  "We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen ability (to play the ball) and if Adam's run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn't moved.
  <br>

  "I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper."

  The VAR delay led to 13 minutes of added time and Brighton nearly snatched victory at the death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended a holiday-shortened session higher as the US Black Friday shopping spree gathered steam and traders speculated whether President-elect Donald Trump may back off from his threatened tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The yen rallied against the US dollar as higher inflation in Japan fueled expectations that the central bank will hike interest rates again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are closing out a rollercoaster month for assets caused largely by Trump winning a second US presidential election -- and also a result of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are tracking developments surrounding Trump's pledge to hammer China, Canada and Mexico with hefty tariffs on his first day in office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock markets closed higher on a shortened trading day, with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting fresh records following Thursday's Thanksgiving break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 44,910.65, the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 percent at 6,032.38 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 19,218.17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip companies notched gains after a news report that President Joe Biden's administration was mulling further curbs on semiconductor equipment sales to China that were less severe than anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Nvidia closed 2.2 percent up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be "cruising along here without any interference," said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets closed higher, and London finished with more modest gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With many US investors still out after being off for Thanksgiving yesterday, the key theme that has emerged in the last few days is the easing of tariff fears," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who afterwards said: "There will not be a potential tariff war."
  <br>
  <br>
  The focus was also on shoppers seeking bargains on Black Friday, a crucial day for retailers around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare said Black Friday has become less of a "frenetic rush" given the popularity of online shopping now -- although there is still a lot of attention on the retail space. (AFP)

    Notre Dame unveils its new interior 5 years after fire

<img alt="President Macron and his wife Brigitte admire the stunning renovation. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781464_1_20241129212106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world on Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing sombre memories of its devastating fire in 2019.
 <br>
  <br>
  Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colours of the stained glass windows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior – shown in its full glory on Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 – proved to be breathtaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centrepiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, seeming to fly again above the transept.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral's bright, cream-coloured limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except for artisans, architects and others mobilised for the reconstruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them from the stones' pores, nooks and crevices. In all, 42,000 square metres of stonework were cleaned and decontaminated – an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It feels like it was built yesterday, like it’s just been born, even though Notre Dame is very old," said stonemason Adrien Willeme, who worked on the reconstruction. "Because it’s been so carefully restored and cleaned, it looks really extraordinary.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colours once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed “the forest.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. At the end of his tour, the president addressed hundreds of workers gathered inside the cathedral and thanked them for their labours on what he called the "building site of the century.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The shock of the reopening will, I want to believe, be as powerful as the one of the fire. But it will be a shock of hope,” he said. “The inferno of Notre Dame was a wound for the nation. And you were its remedy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron will return on December 7 to deliver another address and will attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. (AP)

    Police charge man over deadly 1997 karaoke blaze

<img alt="Police took the suspect to Tsim Sha Tsui for re-enacting the scene. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781467_1_20241129215031.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Saturday that they've laid a holding charge of murder against a 52-year-old man on suspicion of setting a Tsim Sha Tsui karaoke parlour on fire 27 years ago, leaving 17 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case will be mentioned at West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said they were informed by their mainland counterparts earlier this week that the suspect had been apprehended. The man was sent back to Hong Kong on Thursday through the Shenzhen Bay border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lam Kai-chor from the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau said the force had verified the man's identity through his fingerprints.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The force has evidence to show that the suspect played a major role in the case," he alleged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hooded suspect was brought back to the scene on Friday night to re-enact the case. He was given a plastic bottle which resembled a Molotov cocktail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Molotov cocktails were thrown at the now-shuttered Top One Karaoke on January 25, 1997, days after two gangs got into a quarrel at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventeen people died due to smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other culprits have been arrested and sentenced in connection with the case. Four of them have been jailed for life, while another received 11 years for manslaughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remaining suspect, Chan Fok-ching, is still on the run. Police said a HK$400,000 reward continues to be offered for information leading to his arrest.

    Halep blasts tennis doping body for Swiatek leniency

<img alt="Simona Halep is angry because Iga Swiatek seems to have been let off lightly for a similar offence. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781458_1_20241129204705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's Simona Halep on Friday rounded on the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) for discrepencies in the treatment of world number two Iga Swiatek after testing positive for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA announced a one-month ban on Thursday for Swiatek after the 23-year-old had tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now 33, returned to tennis in March this year after her own career had been on hold since October 7, 2022, the date of the start of her provisional suspension after testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon singles titles was then caught up in a second affair, this time "irregularities" in the data of her biological passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA, but Halep successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February, arguing her positive test for roxadustat – used to treat anaemia and banned as a blood doping agent – was the result of a tainted supplement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wonder why there is such a difference in treatment and judgement? I don't find and I don't think there can be a logical answer," Halep said in a long message posted in Romanian on her Instagram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can only be bad will on the part of the ITIA, the organisation that did everything to destroy me despite the evidence. It wanted at all costs to destroy the last years of my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now sitting 877th in the world rankings, added: "I suffered, I suffer and I will perhaps always suffer from the injustice that was done to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it possible that in identical cases taking place at roughly the same time, the ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?
  <br>
  <br>
  "I lost two years of my career, I suffered many sleepless nights, thoughts, anxiety, unanswered questions... but I got justice. It turned out that it was a contamination and that (the anomaly in my) biological passport was pure invention." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that the Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, will become the new permanent secretary for the environment and ecology early next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  He'll replace Janice Tse on January 2, when she will begin her pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another senior appointment, deputy secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Manda Chan will head the Leisure and Cultural Services Department from next Wednesday, taking over from the retiring Vincent Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung described the two appointees as seasoned administrative officers with proven leadership and management skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have every confidence that they will continue to serve the community with professionalism in their new capacity," she said in a statement, while also thanking the two retiring officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung joined the government's administrative service in October 1993, and rose to the rank of administrative officer staff grade A in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has served in various bureaus and departments, including a three-year stint as the special representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union from 2019, before heading RTHK since October 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan, meanwhile, joined the administrative service in September 1995 and rose to the rank of Administrative Officer Staff Grade B1 in April this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was the Commissioner for Narcotics of the Security Bureau for more than three years from 2016, and was the Commissioner for Rehabilitation of the Labour and Welfare Bureau for around three years until October 2022.

    Northern Metropolis projects to invite tender in 2025

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it will solicit views from the industry on three Northern Metropolis projects next month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781445_1_20241129192157.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will start accepting tenders for three pilot development areas in the Northern Metropolis as soon as the second half of next year, and the projects could be completed in a decade or so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plots, in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and San Tin, range from 12.5 to 18.6 hectares in size. Each will have its own residential, industrial and public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung Shui Kiu has been earmarked as a "high-end professional services and logistics hub". A Technopole is planned in San Tin, while Fanling North is mainly designed to provide housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau said baseline scenarios it set for the three sites have been deemed as financially viable by a consultant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said developers will be asked to largely adhere to the scenarios in regards to development.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials will also listen to feedback for potential adjustments, before the projects are put up for tender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers will have to carry out site formation as well as engineering infrastructure works, such as building roads and drainage. They'll have exclusive rights to residential blocks within the development site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the three sites will provide some 630,000 square metres of residential gross floor area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The large parcel development mode is a new concept in Hong Kong, but it's been widely adopted on the mainland. So we look forward to attracting not just local developers, but also those from the mainland," the spokesperson said, later adding that overseas firms are also welcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  The person pointed to existing mechanisms assessing whether participating developers are financially robust. In the event they run into capital trouble, there will be safeguards to ensure delivery of the projects.

    Crypto boss eats banana 'art' he bought for US$6.2mn

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun on Friday fulfilled a promise he made after spending US$6.2 million on an artwork featuring a banana duct-taped to a wall – by eating the fruit.
 <br>
  <br>
  At one of Hong Kong's priciest hotels, Sun chomped down on a banana in front of dozens of journalists and influencers after giving a speech hailing the work as "iconic" and drew parallels between conceptual art and cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's much better than other bananas," Sun said after getting his first taste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really quite good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Titled "Comedian," the conceptual work created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan was sold at a Sotheby's auction in New York last week, with Sun among seven bidders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he felt "disbelief" in the first 10 seconds after he won the bid, before realising "this could become something big."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10 seconds after that, he decided he would eat the banana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Eating it at a press conference can also become a part of the artwork's history," he said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The debut of the edible creation at the 2019 Art Basel show in Miami Beach sparked controversy and raised questions about whether it should be considered art – Cattelan's stated aim.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Sun on Friday compared conceptual art like "Comedian" to NFT art and decentralised blockchain technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most of its objects and ideas exist as (intellectual property) and on the internet, as opposed to something physical," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also this week disclosed a US$30 million investment in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project backed by US president-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crypto businessman was last year charged by the US Securities and Exchange Commission with offering and selling unregistered securities in relation to his crypto project Tron. The case is ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a function room at the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong, two men dressed as auction house staff stood in front of a featureless wall with the yellow banana offering the only splash of colour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he only recently decided to bid for the artwork, adding he had "dumb questions" such as whether the banana had decayed and how to value the work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The artwork owner is given a certificate of authenticity that the work was created by Cattelan as well as instructions about how to replace the fruit when it goes bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event attendees on Friday each received a roll of duct tape and a banana as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has a banana to eat," he said. (AFP)

    'Boost from multi-entry permits will take time'

<img alt="The Hong Kong Retail Management Association says it will take time for all sectors to fully benefit from the multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781432_1_20241129181641.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Retail Management Association on Friday hailed the mainland authorities' move to bring back multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong, saying it will boost consumption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This policy, along with the increase in the duty-free allowance for mainland visitors and the expansion of the individual visit scheme, will stimulate the flow of visitors to Hong Kong and contribute to the local retail market," executive director Bond Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, [due to] the change in tourist consumption patterns, it will take some time and effort from all sectors to enable the multiple entry policy to fully take effect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Agnes Chan, chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said it will now be more convenient for Shenzhen residents to come to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This will inject fresh momentum into sectors such as tourism, food and beverage, and retail, while boosting market confidence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Shui, vice president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the measure will boost the region’s economic growth through attracting more visitors, and broaden the SAR's appeal as a destination for mega tourism events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shui said the arrangement will not only help with the recovery of the tourism industry, but will also foster cultural and economic exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Chan, head of Research at CBRE Hong Kong, said retail, food and beverage businesses near MTR stations in the New Territories will particularly benefit from the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This, together with the expanded capacity of the Hong Kong International Airport via the commissioning of the third runway will warrant sustained and accelerating inbound tourism recovery for Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he also expects leasing demand for shops at sightseeing spots to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Should interest rates further lower, domestic consumption will also strengthen as household burdens reduce. A fuller retail market recovery is expected for 2025.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Enterprise representatives said on Friday they are confident about the development of the Northern Metropolis.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 85 companies were present at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation, including developers such as Sun Hung Kai Properties, Swire Properties and China Resources Land.
  <br>
  <br>
  They signed an expression of interest regarding the Northern Metropolis development, along with separate agreements for various projects worth some HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Bank of China's Deputy Chief Executive Wang Huabin said the Northern Metropolis' planning compliments Hong Kong's positioning as an international finance, aviation, trading and innovative hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe the Northern Metropolis will act as a new force to drive Hong Kong's development in the future. Our corporation highly values the building and development of the Northern Metropolis," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As early as 2022 when the metropolis plan was first suggested, we had already formulated and announced that we will establish a comprehensive financial services plan for the area," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the bank will strengthen its efforts to attract more investors to the area to complement the Hong Kong government's plan, by providing financial services to companies that invest in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank signed a cooperation agreement with nine corporations, with one agreement worth more than HK$20 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also present at the signing ceremony was Daryl Ng, deputy chairman of real estate corporation Sino Group. He said the group will support the development of the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's plan, we see there will be a third medical school in the Northern Metropolis. We also see it involves a lot of innovative technology projects and the building of a university city. I think the potential of the Northern Metropolis is very high and our group is confident in the development of the region," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday called on the business sector to get on board with the development of the Northern Metropolis, adding that the government will roll out large parcels of land in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three sites are different in scale and components, suiting varying commercial interests and risk appetite. I'm confident that this would provide the private sector with a brand new and efficient way to participate in our development and in return benefit our society as a whole," Lee said at a signing ceremony for enterprise participation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that while the development of the Northern Metropolis will be government-led, market participation is just as vital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the [Lok Ma Chau] loop and other development areas in the pipeline, the Northern Metropolis will become a region that radiates beyond geographical boundaries. Taking forward a development of this scale and gravitas requires the efforts and resources of all sectors of our community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the liaison office, told the same ceremony that business leaders should take the initiative in taking forward projects in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The development of the Northern Metropolis is a major initiative for Hong Kong's innovative development. It represents a focal point for economic growth and breakthrough innovation, and is also a key strategic move for Hong Kong to better integrate into the development of the Greater Bay Area and the country."

 Two political parties on Friday expressed support for the mainland's move to bring back multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visits will still be limited to seven days, but from December 1, Shenzhen residents can apply to come to the SAR as often as they like, rather than just once a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee, from the DAB, said the move shows Beijing's support and care for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very, very much thankful for the central government's support and attention for Hong Kong," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope different sectors in society can make good use of the central authorities' support measures to revitalise the local economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federation of Trade Unions, meanwhile, said the move will boost exchanges between the people of Shenzhen and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This of course also helps local tourism and drives the development of related industries. Our federation very much welcomes this," its president, Stanley Ng, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we hope that Hong Kong's capacity to receive visitors can improve, for example our border transport, our facilities and tourism hotspots."
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation said it hopes sporting and cultural events at Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District will attract more tourists to the city.

<img alt="The Travel Industry Council expects there will be at least 20 percent more Shenzhen visitors coming to Hong Kong over Christmas.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Travel Industry Council (TIC) on Friday welcomed the mainland's move to allow Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong as many times as they want in future, rather than only once per week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Executive director Fanny Yeung said the visa change, which comes into effect on December 1, is "very significant" for the tourism sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expects the number of visitors from Shenzhen to increase by at least 20 percent over Christmas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all these kinds of beautiful Christmas decorations...the atmosphere, the vibes, you cannot find it in any mainland city," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the TIC has come up with new ways to attract tourists from across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are encouraging our travel agents to offer more half day in-depth tours to attract these groups of visitors because these are experienced visitors here in Hong Kong. They know a lot of places in Hong Kong already. But most of them, they don't know about the history, or some back-end stories of some particular spots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu also said he believes the multi-entry permits will boost the sector, adding that they will allow more people to join the SAR's mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the move provides a shot in the arm for businesses, but they also need to make improvements such as offering more specialty products to encourage spending.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new three-runway system will enable more flights to and from Chek Lap Kok and will bring down air fares, Airport Authority chief Steven Yiu said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three runways came into operation on Thursday, with officials eyeing a boost in capacity to 120 million passengers per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu, the authority's executive director, told RTHK that airlines are queuing up to get hold of additional departure and arrival slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The airlines are excited about the three-runway system because they want to be able to operate more trips. If short-haul flights that take around four to five hours for a round-trip leave in the morning, that means they may be able to make three trips a day. From an operating point of view, this increases airlines' efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu said the authority is hoping to attract more airlines to use Hong Kong for lay overs and is hoping for more long-haul routes to be opened up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past six months, we have provided incentives to airlines if they are willing to provide flights to places that were not available before, or if they add flights to some of our strategic destinations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong will remain an international aviation hub even if competition from other airports in the Greater Bay Area intensifies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at the economy in the Greater Bay Area, there is a total population of 86 million people, which is 10 times the Hong Kong population. The area also has the most vibrant economy in China. Even with the opening of all 11 runways in the area, I believe it will not be sufficient to satisfy all demand," he said.

 More than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit Hong Kong as many times as they like from December 1, the authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mainland officials have reversed their 2015 decision to limit such visits to once per week, allowing Shenzhen residents to apply for multi-entry permits to make repeated trips to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The maximum length of each visit will remain at seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed his gratitude to the central government for making the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee previously said he had requested a return to the earlier arrangement, which was scrapped due to concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, from next year Zhuhai residents can apply for weekly trips to Macau, while those living in the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin will be able to go to Macau as many times as they like for up to seven days at a time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Premier League side Eastern on Thursday night crashed out of contention in the AFC Champions League Two – Asia's second-tier club football tournament – suffering a 4-1 defeat to Australian side Sydney FC in their Group E match-up at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sydney jumped out to a commanding 3-0 lead in the first half, thanks to an early goal from Moroccan striker Anas Ouahim in the fifth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed up by a 16th-minute half-volley by Patryk Klimala, as Ouahim deflected a shot for Sydney's third goal to close out the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastern striker Noah Baffoe pulled one goal back for the home team with a glancing header from a free kick in the 49th.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Ouahim's individual brilliance that sealed the victory for the Australians, scoring a penalty in the 62nd minute to secure the first-ever hat-trick of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one round left, the win guarantees Sydney's progression to the last 16 of the continental competition for just the second time in the club’s history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They next face Philippine side Kaya FC in their final group match on December 5, while Eastern will travel to Hiroshima to play Japan side Sanfrecce on the same day.

    Zeman calls for 'panda island' attraction

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former chairman of Ocean Park says the theme park needs to make the most of its unique panda attractions to boost returns and get back to profitability.
 <br>
  <br>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme that outside of the mainland, nowhere else in the world had six pandas and Ocean Park should create a 'panda island' to capitalise on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact that we have six pandas, if they do a panda island, they find a piece of land... have all the six pandas together... panda restaurants, panda shops... panda games... really create something that no other part of the world has. And I think that would really drive a lot of business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park unveiled its latest full-year result on Thursday, saying it recorded a deficit of more than HK$71.6 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeman said promoting the "panda economy" would be key to the park's success going forward, especially after the government's time-limited subvention – capped at HK$280 million a year – ends after the 2025-2026 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the limitations facing Ocean Park in setting its own admission fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Corporation is a statutory board that is a not-for-profit organisation, aiming to provide education and conservation at an affordable price.

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs and migrants into the US was controlled.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday ruled out a trade war with the United States after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened stiff tariffs to halt illegal immigration.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There will not be a potential tariff war," Sheinbaum - who has been scrambling to head off threatened tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican goods - told a daily news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was speaking a day after a telephone call with Trump, who has threatened to slap tariffs on Canada and China in addition to Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their call, Sheinbaum and Trump offered differing accounts of what they had discussed regarding migration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump claimed that Mexico's left-wing president had "agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum later said she had discussed a policy already in place, and denied Trump's version again on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can assure you... that we would never - we would not be capable - of proposing that we were going to close the border," she said, adding: "Of course we do not agree with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she had assured the Republican leader that a caravan of migrants assembled in southern Mexico, over which Trump had expressed concern, "will not reach the northern border," pointing to Mexico's "strategy" of preventing such convoys crossing its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that after that, the talks had no longer revolved around the threat of tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump caused panic among some of the biggest US trading partners on Monday when he said he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10 percent on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard warned on Wednesday that some 400,000 jobs in the United States could be lost if Trump followed through on his threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said Thursday that further conversations were planned between her government and Trump's transition team before his January 20 inauguration. (AFP)

<img alt="Jansen holds the ball after taking seven wickets in the first innings. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781315_1_20241129075058.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marco Jansen bowled South Africa into a dominant position as Sri Lanka crashed to 42 all out, their lowest total in Test cricket, on the second day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The left-arm fast bowler took seven for 13 as Sri Lanka were bowled out in 13.5 overs – the second-shortest completed Test innings in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It gave South Africa a first innings lead of 149 after they had been dismissed for a modest 191 in their first innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts stretched their lead to 281 runs when they scored 132 for three in their second innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the 2.06-metre Jansen, one of the tallest players in international cricket, admitted that he struggled to control the ball at the start of his spell with a strong wind blowing across the ground being a "massive factor".
  <br>
  <br>
  Having played only in eight T20 matches since returning from a three-month "conditioning break", the 24-year-old Jansen sent down a wide and a no-ball before opening batsman Pathum Nissanka had to put bat on ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I struggled to get my wrist behind the ball. It felt like I was battling something but I just tried to make it work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kagiso Rabada made the breakthrough for South Africa when he had Dimuth Karunaratne caught at first slip before Jansen, in his second over, bowled a delivery close enough to Nissanka to induce an edge to third slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked an inspired spell. Jansen's pace and bounce, allied with the ability to make the ball swing in as a variation to his natural angle across right-handed batsmen, proved devastating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he still bowled another two no-balls. After at least two of his wickets he looked back anxiously at the umpire to make sure he hadn't over-stepped again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, though, that once he found his rhythm, "the ball was moving nice and quickly off the pitch. We knew if we put the ball in the right areas we would always be in the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his break from cricket, ordered by Cricket South Africa, had refreshed him mentally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel I can go for longer periods of time, concentrating at a high level," said Jansen. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund scored twice as Manchester United won a chaotic Uefa Europa League encounter against Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, giving Ruben Amorim a vital win in his first home game at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho gave the home side a lightning start after a shocking error from opposition goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hakon Evjen levelled for the Norwegians and Philip Zinckernagel surged down the right wing to give them a shock lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hojlund pulled United level with a superb finish just before half-time and poked them ahead early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  New United boss Amorim said the match was a "real ride" and that he was on a steep learning curve as he gets to know his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I see what everybody sees – good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end trying to hold the result, but the lads did a great job," Amorim said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ran, they pressed, they tried to do the thing we worked for these three days and we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he said he was touched by the reception he was given by the home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn't know me, doesn't really know me," he added. "I came from Portugal. I did nothing for this love yet so the way they made me feel at home, it's so special."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who has said his methods will take time to implement, made six changes from the side that laboured to a 1-1 draw against Ipswich in his first game in charge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrell Malacia returned to the United line-up for the first time since the final game of the 2022 to 2023 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt also made multiple changes with one eye on domestic matters – they are top of the Norwegian league table by a point with one match to come. (AFP)

    Poland's Swiatek accepts one-month doping suspension

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, 23, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA, however, accepted that it was caused by "the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication (melatonin), manufactured and sold in Poland that the player had been taking for jet lag and sleep issues".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violation was therefore not intentional – the player's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for 'No Significant Fault or Negligence'," the ITIA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning French Open champion Swiatek, who has five Grand Slam singles titles – four at Roland Garros and the 2022 US Open – accepted the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm finally allowed – so I instantly want to share with you something that became the worst experience of my life," an emotional Swiatek said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the last two-and-a-half months I was subject to strict ITIA proceedings, which confirmed my innocence," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive doping test in my career, showing unbelievably low level of a banned substance I've never heard about before, put everything I've worked so hard for my entire life into question.

  "Both me and my team had to deal with tremendous stress and anxiety. Now everything has been carefully explained, and with a clean slate I can go back to what I love most."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek was provisionally suspended from September 22 until October 4, missing three tournaments, which counts towards the sanction, leaving eight days remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will also forfeit prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I will be stronger than ever," continued Swiatek. "Right now I'm just relieved it's over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be open with you, even though I know I did nothing wrong. Out of respect for my fans and the public, I'm sharing all the details of this longest and toughest tournament of my career," she went on to say. "My biggest hope is that you will stay with me." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Detroit Lions survived a late rally from the Chicago Bears, with a little piece of good fortune, to make it ten wins a row with a 23-20 win on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening game of a trio of Thanksgiving Day clashes went down to the wire but Chicago made a mess of their final possession, allowing Detroit to move to 11-1 on the season for the first time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions had led 16-0 at the half after three field goals and a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Sam LaPorta.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bears fought back strongly with three touchdowns in the second half – two of them on the connection between quarterback Caleb Williams and receiver Keeman Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Williams found D.J. Moore with a superb 31-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter, the Lions' advantage was reduced to three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago forced Detroit to punt on the next possession, leaving Williams with the ball and the chance to take the game to overtime or win it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of penalties hampered the Bears' final drive but despite Williams taking a sack with 36 seconds left in the game, a field goal opportunity remained well within reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  But instead of taking a timeout, the Bears offense tried to set up to gain some more yards for kicker Cairo Santos losing precious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was snapped with just six seconds left and Williams threw an incomplete pass as the clock ran out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bears, who suffered their sixth straight loss, looked confused and frustrated while the sense of relief was evident on the faces of the Lions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a crazy ending and we fought hard to the end to get it done – but it was scary," admitted Goff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our defense held strong. Our defense, they'll bend not break and they made those plays at the end there and we win," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared Goff went 21-for-34 for 221 yards and two touchdowns while on the ground, the running back pair Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery put up 175 yards between them. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government said on Thursday that it rejects and strongly disapproves of the European Parliament’s so-called resolution on Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European body earlier passed a non-binding resolution, calling for the “immediate and unconditional” release of all opposition figures who had been sentenced on national security charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for sanctions to be imposed on Hong Kong and mainland officials, and demanded that Hong Kong’s favourable customs treatment be revoked.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SAR government said it strongly condemns the baseless claims made against its officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed that as an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong needs to put in place a complete and effective set of national security legislation to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that many other common law jurisdictions also have their own national security legislation, and that the European Parliament should not interfere in Hong Kong matters and China's internal affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman stressed that all trials in Hong Kong are being conducted in an open, fair and independent manner.

 Police said a 75-year-old man has been arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out along a road in Tsuen Wan the day before.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blaze, which destroyed part of a six-metre-tall noise barrier on Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate, disrupted traffic for much of the day on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said the suspect was identified after reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing nearby residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He lives near the scene of the crime. When he was arrested, we found three medium-sized lighters and a utility knife on him. He was arrested on suspicion of arson and possession of offensive weapon, and is currently being detained for questioning," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations are continuing, he added.

<img alt="The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong called on the US to stop smearing the SAR. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781289_1_20241128215346.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong on Thursday said it strongly disapproves and rejects a decision by Washington to update its travel advisory for Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office made the remarks a day after the US Department of State issued a “Level 2” alert for those intending to travel to Hong Kong, saying people should “exercise increased caution” due to the “arbitrary enforcement” of national security legislation in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office stressed Hong Kong is one of the safest and most livable cities in the world, adding that national security legislation – the formulation and implementation of which are in line with international practice and the rule of law – has brought stability to the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman pointed out that the SAR has welcomed 21 million visitors during the first half of this year, 64 percent more than the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Foreign funds, enterprises and talented individuals also continued to pour in, showing the international community’s trust in Hong Kong,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office called on the US to stop smearing Hong Kong through repeatedly issuing travel advisories, saying the SAR – as an open and free international city – will continue to welcome international visitors with open arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government also issued a separate statement, calling on the US to stop using its travel advisories as a political tool to smear Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson stressed there are clear lines being drawn when it comes to the city's national security legislation, and tourists will not unwittingly fall foul of the law.

    Australia passes social media law banning youngsters

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia passed a law on Thursday to ban social media for children aged under 16 after days of heated debate, setting a standard for other countries to follow in a global push to curb the power of Big Tech.
 <br>
  <br>
  The law, expected to take effect in November 2025, sets some of the toughest social media controls in the world and will force platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a parliamentary session that went into the night, the country's Senate, or upper house of parliament, voted to pass the law after the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won support from the conservative opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's approval for the law is the final legislative hurdle after the lower house, or House of Representatives, passed the bill on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, had argued that social media posed risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia plans to trial an age-verification system that may include biometrics or government identification to enforce the ban. The trial will run for several months and its findings would be reviewed by mid-2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the law, companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In submissions to parliament, Alphabet's Google and Meta said the ban should be delayed until the age-verification trial finishes, expected in mid-2025. Bytedance's TikTok said the bill needed more consultation, while Elon Musk's X argued the proposed law might hurt children's human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Senate committee backed the bill this week, but also inserted a condition that social media platforms should not force users to submit personal data such as passport and other digital identification to prove their age. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German investigators suspect a Berlin doctor of killing eight elderly patients under his care and setting fire to some of their homes to cover up his crimes, prosecutors said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The unnamed suspect, 40, who worked in palliative care for a nursing service, was remanded in custody in August on suspicion of killing four women aged 72 to 94 and starting fires at their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors in Berlin have now linked the suspect to four more deaths of men and women aged between 61 and 83, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was being investigated on four counts of manslaughter, one count of arson and three counts of attempted arson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Berlin prosecutors said they were now treating the alleged killings as murder cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accused appears to have had no motive for killing the people other than the act of killing itself," they said, accusing him of a "lust for murder".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police in August said the man was suspected of killing four female patients in the care of his nursing service in Berlin between June 11 and July 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an 87-year-old woman was resuscitated after emergency services arrived, but died later in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another, the suspect allegedly started a blaze but the fire went out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he realised this, he allegedly informed a relative of the woman and claimed that he was standing in front of her flat and that nobody was answering the doorbell," police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the four new cases, which date back to the period from June 2022 to April 2024, the suspect is accused of killing two men and two women in Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, he is suspected of administering a cocktail of medications to a 70-year-old female patient in her apartment in Berlin's Tempelhof district and then starting a fire to cover up his crime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire department, called by a neighbour, was able to prevent the flames from spreading to the rest of the building.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also accused of administering deadly medications to two men, aged 70 and 83, and to a 61-year-old woman. (AFP)

    EU invites UK prime minister Starmer to defence talks

<img alt="The encounter between Keir Starmer and the EU will be the first of its kind since London's 2020 departure from the bloc. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781265_1_20241128191850.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU will invite British premier Keir Starmer for talks on defence with the bloc's 27 leaders in February, Brussels said Thursday, as the two sides push to rebuild ties after Brexit.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior European Union official said Brussels intends to organise "informal retreats", starting with a meeting in Belgium on February 3 focused on security issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The encounter would be the first of its kind between the EU and Britain since London's 2020 departure from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For this one, the idea is to invite the secretary general of NATO and the UK prime minister," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outreach to Starmer is part of efforts to forge better ties after the acrimony caused by Britain's exit from the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British prime minister -- who came to power in July -- made his first visit to Brussels last month to launch the long road to a reset.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of those efforts, he agreed with European Commission chief to start holding regular summits between the two sides from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer's government has mooted reaching a "security pact" with the EU but details so far remain vague on what that would entail.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who voted in the UK's 2016 Brexit referendum to remain in the EU, has insisted his reset will not mean reversing Brexit, which remains a politically toxic subject in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The February talks on defence will come at a crucial juncture, just after Donald Trump assumes power in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain and the EU have been staunch supporters of Ukraine in its war against Russia and are warily eyeing Trump's promises to end the conflict quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brussels is currently reshuffling its top leadership, with former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa set to replace Belgium's Charles Michel as head of the European Council on Sunday. (AFP)

 The Tourism Board and certification authorities are encouraging restaurants, hotels and attractions to enhance their Muslim-friendly offerings by obtaining Halal certification, with the aim of enriching the experience of Muslim visitors to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The board said on Thursday that the number of certified Halal and Halal-friendly restaurants has risen from approximately 100 at the start of the year to around 130.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR now has its first ever high-end Chinese restaurant certified as Halal-friendly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saito Chau, culinary director of Chinesology, said the certification process was extremely detailed, encompassing everything from menu design and the procurement of cutlery and cooking utensils to selecting appropriate ingredients.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that achieving the Halal-friendly status was a significant milestone in making Chinese cuisine more accessible to Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, the restaurant has recreated the popular "char siu", or Chinese barbecue pork, with beef instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Muslim diners do not know much about Chinese cuisines, many of whom have never tried Chinese cuisine before. This inspires us to offer a culinary experience to Muslim visitors that allows them to explore the sophistication of the Chinese culinary culture by getting to taste the dishes themselves," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becky Ip, deputy executive director of the board, said the SAR is committed to expanding its outreach to visitors from Middle Eastern and Asean markets, recognising the significant potential and spending power of Muslim consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just started the whole support to our agencies and also the [Incorporated Trustees of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong] Board of Trustees for making Hong Kong more Muslim-friendly, particularly in the dining scene," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a beginning as we just started in June this year, so so far we have about 30 new restaurants joining as Halal-friendly restaurants. So hoping by doing so, we will have more. We'd like to see more restaurants participate in the scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip added that they have intensified promotional efforts in Muslim source markets to draw more visitors from Southeast Asia and the Middle East to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[It is] very important to let Muslim travellers understand well [that when] they come to enjoy Hong Kong, it will also be very safe for them to eat the food in Hong Kong, where they stay will be very safe for them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually brought a few delegations to the Middle East and quite some delegations to promote Hong Kong together with our trade partners in these areas, Middle East and Southeast Asian countries. Apart from that, we also have invited over the past few months a series of KOLs, media and trade partners to come and see Hong Kong themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Particularly let them have a chance to sample our hotel facilities and sample the Hong Kong food they look forward to. It's very, very important."

 The HK$141 billion three-runway system at Hong Kong airport went into operation on Thursday, with authorities hailing it as a historic moment for the city's aviation development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three flights - two taking off and one landing - were handled simultaneously at Chek Lap Kok in the afternoon, witnessed by top SAR and mainland officials attending a ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guests included Chief Executive John Lee, Vice Minister of Transport Xu Chengguang and the director of Beijing's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The various airlines also need to fully enhance their services, strengthening major routes and to explore more new destinations for Hong Kong, especially to countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in order to raise industry competitiveness," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Hong Kong’s largest infrastructure projects in recent years, the three-runway system involved the reclamation of 650 hectares of land to house the 3.8 kilometre-long extra runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new system boosts the airport's capacity to 120 million passengers per year, on top 10 million tonnes of cargo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airport Authority chairman Fred Lam pledged to continue to implement the Airport City blueprint unveiled in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will attract travellers from all around the world, boost the flow of people and goods, and act as an engine of Hong Kong’s economic development," he said at the commissioning ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said that it is now taking forward the phase two development of AsiaWorld-Expo, while a large-scale storage facility and other new projects will be completed from 2026 to 2031.
