<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has expressed strong disapproval and discontent over the United States for imposing a fresh round of tariffs and cancelling a duty-free exemption on small parcels.
 <br>
  <br>
  It called on Washington to withdraw the “bullying” measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump earlier announced a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also signed an executive order to cancel a trade exemption known as "de minimis", which allows low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the country free of duties, from May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's measures are bullying and unreasonable, and grossly inconsistent with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, willfully undermining the multilateral trading system which is the cornerstone for international trade," a Hong Kong government spokesperson said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once again, the government firmly requests the US to withdraw its so-called reciprocal tariff measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to changes to the "de minimis" exemption, the administration said Hongkong Post will temporarily maintain postal services to the US without collecting any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US until May 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has been repeatedly changing its policies unilaterally. Hongkong Post has requested the postal administration of the US to promptly clarify the matter and should not cause inconvenience to the public," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration also pledged to closely monitor and assess any unilateral measures of the US that are inconsistent with fair trade, saying it will defend the city's legitimate interests by, for example, filing a complaint to the WTO.

    Australia records hottest 12 months ever

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has just sweltered through its hottest 12 months on record, a weather official said on Thursday, a period of drenching floods, tropical cyclones and mass coral bleaching.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior government climatologist Simon Grainger said the rolling 12-month period between April 2024 and March 2025 was 1.61 degrees Celsius above average – the hottest since records began more than a century ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is certainly part of a sustained global pattern," Grainger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been seeing temperatures since about April 2023 that were globally much warmer than anything we have seen in the global historical record."
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous hottest period was in 2019, he added, when temperatures were 1.51 degrees Celsius above average.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is a pretty significant difference," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's well above what we would expect just from uncertainties due to rounding. The difference is much larger than that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The record was measured on a rolling 12-month basis, rather than as a calendar year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia has also recorded its hottest-ever March, Grainger said, with temperatures more than two degrees above what would normally be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There has basically been sustained warmth through pretty much all of Australia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw a lot of heatwave conditions, particularly in Western Australia. And we didn't really see many periods of cool weather – we didn't see many cold fronts come through." (AFP)

    Hungary to withdraw from ICC as Israeli leader visits

<img alt="Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Viktor Orban (left). Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798838_1_20250403185544.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungary's government has decided to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, it said on Thursday, shortly after Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, sought under an ICC arrest warrant, arrived in the country for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban invited his Israeli counterpart to Budapest in November, a day after the ICC issued its arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, where Israel launched its offensive following an attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has rejected the accusations, which it says are politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism. It says the ICC has lost all legitimacy by issuing the warrants against a democratically elected leader of a country exercising the right of self defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a founding member of the ICC, Hungary is theoretically obliged to arrest and hand over anyone subject to a warrant from the court but Orban made clear that Hungary would not respect the ruling, which he called "brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hungary signed the ICC's founding document in 1999 and ratified it in 2001, but the law has not been promulgated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, said in November that although Hungary ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, it "was never made part of Hungarian law," meaning that no measure of the court can be carried out within Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Gulyas told state news agency MTI that the government would launch the withdrawal process later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orban had raised the prospect of Hungary's exit from the ICC after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court's prosecutor Karim Khan in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time for Hungary to review what we're doing in an international organisation that is under US sanctions," Orban said on X in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill on starting the year-long process of withdrawing from the ICC is likely to be approved by Hungary's parliament, which is dominated by Orban's Fidesz party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netherlands, which hosts the ICC, said that until withdrawal is complete, Hungary must still meet its duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The full process to withdraw from the ICC takes about a year, during that time Hungary will have to fulfil all its obligations to the court," Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu has enjoyed strong support over the years from Hungary's Orban, an important ally who has been ready to block EU statements or actions critical of Israel in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and his former defence chief were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war as part of a "widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Gaza."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli campaign has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, and devastated the Gaza Strip. The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC also issued an arrest warrant against a Hamas leader in November. His death was confirmed after the warrant was issued. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States is the sole bidder for the 2031 Women's World Cup, and the United Kingdom is set to host the 2035 tournament, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Uefa Congress in Belgrade, Infantino said the only bid for 2031 was "from the USA and potentially some other Concacaf members together, and 2035 is from Europe, from the home nations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino also said Fifa planned to increase the number of participating teams at the Women's World Cup from 32 teams to 48 in time for the 2031 tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's announcement comes after the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed last month that they would submit an expression of interest in staging the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  World football's governing body last month said it would only welcome bids for 2035 from Europe or Africa, saying that the identity of the hosts would be confirmed at a Fifa Congress in the second quarter of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States – who are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada the 2026 men's World Cup – also confirmed in early March that it would push ahead with a bid for 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Morocco had also been in the running with African nations invited to bid too, but Infantino's comments suggest they are now out of the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  The next Women's World Cup will take place in Brazil in 2027. (AFP)

    Sinner doping woes blamed on ex-physio

<img alt="Jannik Sinner's running afoul of anti-doping rules has been blamed on former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi by physical trainer Umberto Ferrara. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798835_1_20250403184040.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis world number one Jannik Sinner's former physical trainer Umberto Ferrara said on Thursday he was blameless in the case of the three-time Grand Slam champion testing positive twice for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner received a three-month ban agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in February after "admitting "partial responsibility" for team mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of them have been laid off by the 23-year-old since the affair came to light.
  <br>
  <br>
  WADA came to an agreement with Sinner after accepting he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara told Gazzetta dello Sport that he had used the spray himself for years after it was prescribed by a doctor for an illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I suggested Naldi use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara said he did not know Naldi had been gloveless and also not washed his hands after using the spray when he treated Sinner, especially after "the warnings he had given him".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With hindsight, it is easy to say I would not do things the same way," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am not proud of the behaviour of others."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have suffered during this affair owing to the bad faith of some," added Ferrara, who has since joined the entourage of 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be Sinner's second tournament after his return as he will also compete on home soil at the Italian Open in Rome from May 7-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reigning US and Australian Open champion Sinner reached the French Open semi-finals last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's tournament is scheduled to run from May 25 until June 8. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any sanctions imposed on public officers are "insults" to the rule of law, the head of Hong Kong's Law Society said on Thursday, days after the United States took action against six officials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its president, Roden Tong, also said in Beijing that the society would not make comments from "a political perspective", but stressed that public servants should not be interfered with when discharging their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any sanctions targeting public officials, lawyers or even businessmen for exercising their due functions and rights in accordance with the law are an insult to the rule of law," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong led a delegation from the society on a four-day visit to the capital, during which the group held a number of exchanges with mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the meetings was with a deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Nong Rong, he said, adding that they discussed a number of law-related topics.

 A boxing coach charged with murdering a man in Fo Tan last month appeared in Shatin Court on Thursday, after he was arrested in Thailand and sent back to Hong Kong this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Truong Quoc Anh, 25, faces a preliminary charge of murder following the death of the 52-year-old man in an attack in Lai Wo Lane on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sha Tin magistrate David Chum adjourned the case until May 29 at the prosecution's request.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police earlier said the defendant was one of nine suspects identified as being connected with the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  All but one of them had been arrested or charged by local or mainland authorities.

 The Hong Kong, China, women's cycling team rode their way to victory at the three-day women's Tour of Thailand, while rising star Ceci Lee claimed second place in the individual general classification.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, Leung Wing-yee, Leung Bo-yee, Yang Qianyu and Kwan Tsz-kwan finished in an overall time of 19 hours, 43 minutes and 37 seconds, tying with the host nation’s Thai team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The title was ultimately awarded to Hong Kong based on superior stage placings across the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hervé Dagorne, head coach of cycling at the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), said the team worked very hard on every stage, and their win is a huge encouragement ahead of the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They bring together a team spirit that will help when we stay together back in Hong Kong, so that is really helpful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, 23, showcased her growing prowess by securing second place in the individual standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She claimed runner-up finishes in the first two stages and third in the final stage, narrowly edged out by Thailand’s Jutatip Maneephan, who dominated with a clean sweep of all three stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earned the white jersey, awarded to the tour’s best young rider.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said that Lee is "a talented cycling rider, but sometimes she misses confidence and it affects her decision or strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a long talk before she left and she was ready for a new start, especially after the disappointment in the Olympics last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She has been working on herself and she's still so strong that she makes good decisions  and she has the support of a team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She also has the support of a new coach, Ben Kersten, who joined HKSI one month ago, so this combination [brought] her to this result."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team now shifts focus to the National Games track cycling test event, set to take place in Hong Kong from April 19 to 21.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equity markets tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump delivered a "haymaker" blow with sweeping tariffs against US partners and rivals, fanning a global trade war that many fear will spark recessions and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: "President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street "had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve "pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo pared its hefty drop but still ended down 2.8 percent, while Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Wellington managed to eke out a small gain as New Zealand faced smaller tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt all tumbled more than one percent, while Vietnam's stock exchange dived 7.8 percent after the country was hit with levies of almost 50 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures were also battered, with the Dow dropping two percent, the Nasdaq plunging more than three percent and the S&P 500 off 2.8 percent off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Safe havens rallied as traders sought to dump risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 and the yen strengthened to 147.04 per dollar from 150.50 the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other currencies, the euro and pound both jumped more than one percent against the dollar on fears about the US economy and bets that the Fed will have to cut interest rates to deal with the impact on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big corporate losers, Sony shed 4.8 percent, while its South Korean rival Samsung was down 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car titan Toyota was off more than five percent, Nissan lost 3.7 percent and Honda was down 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-listed tech investment firm SoftBank was off close to four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed e-commerce giants fell after the removal of a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged the United States to correct its wrongful imposition of reciprocal tariffs and address economic and trade differences with China and other countries through negotiations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guo made the remarks at a regular press briefing on Thursday in response to a query about Washington's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said additional US tariffs on exports from China and other countries seriously violate World Trade Organization regulations and severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese side firmly opposes this and will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," Guo said, adding there's no winner in a trade or tariff war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Including the 20 percent duty imposed earlier this year, the total levies for China stand at 54 percent. (Reporting from Xinhua)

    Tariffs will rebound on US: economists

<img alt="The punitive 54 percent tariffs heaped on Chinese exports from such ports as Qingdao in Shandong can be counterbalanced by pro-active promotions of domestic consumption, says an economist. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798796_1_20250403160427.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union," Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost "every single country" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at  Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that "what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on].
  <br>
  <br>
  "The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that "we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the "de minimis" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war "closer to home", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention," said d'Assier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And they have means to retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."
  <br>
  <br>
  D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'".

    'Not the season' as MH370 search suspended

<img alt="Relatives of the missing MH370 passengers gather in Beijing last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798795_1_20250403145825.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been suspended as it is "not the season", the country's transport minister said, more than a decade after the plane went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They have stopped the operation for the time being, they will resume the search at the end of this year," Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a voice recording.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, it's not the season," Loke said in the recording, which was made during an event at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke's comments come a little over a month after authorities said the search had resumed, following earlier failed attempts that covered vast swathes of the Indian Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres in the Indian Ocean over three years, but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not it will be found will be subject to the search, nobody can anticipate," Loke said, referring to the wreckage of the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December that a new 15,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent mission was conducted on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others were from Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight's disappearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some held placards asking, "When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport worker was on Thursday convicted of rioting in the Yuen Long clashes in 2019 following a retrial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wong Chi-wing, 58, was acquitted in 2021 but the Department of Justice later successfully sought an appeal, sending the case back to the District Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong faced a count each of rioting and wounding with intent, as part of a group of white-shirted men inside the Yuen Long MTR station on July 21, 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  District Court judge Eddie Yip also found him guilty of wounding with intent, saying Wong could be seen in video footage carrying out what the judge described as "an indiscriminate attack" on people at the station.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judge said he had compared the face of the man shown in the footage with pictures of Wong following his arrest, as well as clothes that officers had seized.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip said the trousers and shoes were extremely similar to what the suspect was wearing at the scene, saying the shoes were unique.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that CCTV footage had caught the defendant wearing those trousers and shoes going in and out of his residential building.
  <br>
  <br>
  In mitigation, Wong's lawyer, senior counsel Lawrence Lok, sought a lenient sentence, saying his client wasn't highly involved in the attack, that his wife had passed away and he's now on medication to treat anxiety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentencing is due to take place on Tuesday.

    'Don't go with top-bidder rule for N Metropolis'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Thursday suggested the government take into account the financial stability of developers when it comes to decisions on tender awards for Northern Metropolis projects to the highest bidders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suggestion comes after a Development Bureau announcement this week that 22 Hong Kong and mainland companies had submitted expression of interests in developing three pilot zones in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The zones are located in Hung Shui Kiu, Fanling North and the San Tin Technopole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tenders are set to begin in the second half of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau Kwok-fan cautioned against the highest-bidder-wins principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The bidders' financial strength is also crucial," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the government simply allows the highest bidder to win the tender, it's true that a company might be able to offer a high bid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the company doesn't have much assets, the company's size isn't big, it doesn't have experience building largest-scale infrastructure, or it has a high debt ratio, are we really confident that we can hand them such a large area, or confident that the firm can complete the project by the deadline?"
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the government can adopt a two-envelope approach – which takes into account the bidders' technical competence as well as their financial ability – and awards the tenders to those bidders that have the highest overall scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said given that land in the Northern Metropolis will be developed for various purposes, such as residential and industry, the government should set up a working group to help developers obtain approvals from different bureaus and departments more quickly.

 Japan slammed as "extremely regrettable" US President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs, saying they may break WTO rules and the two countries' trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japanese firms are the biggest investors in the United States but Tokyo has failed to secure an exemption, with Trump announcing a hefty 24-percent levy on Japanese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have conveyed that the unilateral tariff measures taken by the United States are extremely regrettable, and I have again strongly urged [Washington] not to apply them to Japan," said Yoji Muto, trade and industry minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he spoke to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick before Trump's announcement of a new 10-percent baseline tariff and extra levies on selected countries – including close strategic ally Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan [is] very very tough. Great people.... They would charge us 46 percent, and much higher for certain items," Trump said. "We are charging them 24 percent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto said he had explained to Lutnick "how the US tariffs would adversely affect the US economy by undermining the capacity of Japanese companies to invest".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a frank discussion on how to pursue cooperation in the interest of both Japan and the United States that does not rely on tariffs," Muto said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi also said the US measures may contravene World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the two countries' trade treaty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have serious concerns as to consistency with the WTO agreement and Japan-US trade agreement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if Japan will impose retaliatory tariffs or is considering filing a suit to the WTO, Hayashi said: "We decline to disclose details of our considerations." (AFP)

    Chinese rescuers fill vacuum US cuts leave in Myanmar

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798770_1_20250403120430.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward Beijing, whose first responders – as well as their Indian and Russian colleagues – have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also moved to fire nearly all US Agency for International Development staff, who oversee Washington's disaster response efforts overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A functional USAID would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to Myanmar in 48 hours, said Marcia Wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at USAID.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US ambassador to Myanmar Scot Marciel said that while it was unlikely the junta would have allowed big US military teams to enter, Washington could still have "responded more quickly and robustly" were it not for the cuts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described US President Donald Trump's universal tariffs as a major blow to the world economy and said that the European Union was prepared to respond with countermeasures if negotiations failed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel," she said in a statement read out in Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, on Thursday ahead of an EU-Central Asia partnership summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier unveiled a 10 percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States – with a higher 20 percent rate for the European Union – kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall US and global economic growth. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat ended Boston's nine-game NBA winning streak with a 124-103 victory that pushed the reigning champion Celtics further behind Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who rallied to beat New York.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 25 points to lead seven players to score in double figures for the Heat, who fought off a late Celtics surge to notch a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston connected on just 37.2 percent of their shots in the first half in the face of stout Miami defense and Miami pushed their lead to 22 points early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics, led by 24 points from Jaylen Brown, cut the deficit to three, but Miami had pushed it back to 10 entering the fourth quarter. After the Celtics pulled within four early in the final frame the Heat relentlessly pulled away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory solidified Miami's position in the Eastern Conference play-in while the Celtics fell five games behind the Cavaliers atop the conference with six games left in the regular-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 on impressive 10-of-11 shooting for the Cavs, who rallied from an early 15-point deficit to beat the Knicks 124-105 in Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but after closing the first half on a 10-2 scoring run the Cavaliers out-scored the Knicks 38-25 in the third quarter to seize control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't put our best foot forward at the start," Mitchell said. "We came out kind of sloppy. For the rest of the game, the last three quarters, we did what we were supposed to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell added six rebounds, five assists and three of Cleveland's five blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just trying to do everything I can to win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks remained three games ahead of the fourth-placed Indiana Pacers, who were fueled by 22 points and 10 assists from Tyrese Haliburton in a 110-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six finishers in each conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while the seventh- through 10th-placed teams will battle through the play-in tournament for the final two spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Houston Rockets clinched their first playoff spot in five years in emphatic style, beating the league-worst Utah Jazz 143-105. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of traffic accidents disrupted early morning commutes on Thursday, with collisions occurring in quick succession along Lung Cheung Road and Ching Cheung Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  At about 7:30am, a major collision involving seven private cars occurred on Lung Cheung Road’s Kwun Tong-bound lanes near Lung Cheung Road Park. The crash left six people injured – five men and one woman – all of whom were brought to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage showed the rear of a car pointing upwards as it lay on top of another car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just nine minutes later, a coach and a private car collided on the same road’s Kwun Tong-bound section near Wong Tai Sin Temple. No injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  And two minutes later, a three-vehicle accident occurred on Ching Cheung Road near Caritas Medical Centre. The collision involved two taxis and a private car, with one taxi passenger – who suffered chest and back pain – taken to Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department said some of the Kwun Tong-bound lanes of Lung Cheung Road near Lung Cheung Road Park are closed, and that traffic is congested.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday said it "firmly opposes" sweeping new US tariffs on its exports, vowing "countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  US tariffs "do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties", the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for Washington to "immediately cancel" sweeping new tariffs, warning they "endanger global economic development" and would hurt US interests and international supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to immediately cancel unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with trade partners through equal dialogue," the ministry said, adding: "There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many trading partners have expressed strong dissatisfaction and clear opposition," the ministry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday slapped a 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. (Agencies)

 Hong Kong stocks sank more than two percent in opening trades on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against trade partners, including 34 percent on imports from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index dropped 2.43 percent, or 564 points, to 22,638, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.91 percent, or 30 points, to 3,319.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial markets have been jolted by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements, with US stock futures down by as much as three percent early on Thursday and Tokyo’s market leading losses in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices sank more than US$2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the price of gold hit a new record, crossing its previous record at around Wednesday 2300 GMT and then continuing to climb above US$3,150 an ounce, as traders piled into the safe haven asset. (Agencies)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798734_1_20250403084633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

    'Tariffs will change global trading system'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to "fight" against US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he warned will "fundamentally change the global trading system."
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's unveiling of 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world and harsh additional levies on key trading partners ignited global anger, but for Canada the impact of the latest announcement was limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously announced US levies on Canadian steel and aluminium remain in place. Canada may also be hit hard by Trump's auto sector tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But America's northern neighbour and largest trading partner was not singled out for additional tariffs, and Canadian goods compliant with an existing North American free trade agreement appear exempt from new levies for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney noted that Trump's latest announcement "preserved a number of important elements of our relationship, the commercial relationship between Canada and the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who replaced Justin Trudeau last month, said Trump's trade war will "negatively" impact the US economy and will "directly affect millions of Canadians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to fight these tariffs with counter measures. We are going to protect our workers," Carney said in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a crisis it is important to come together and it is essential to act with purpose and with force and that is what we will do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week in a call with Trump, the pair agreed to discuss the future of bilateral trade after the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls currently project Carney's Liberal Party will win a majority. (AFP)

    US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese

 Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are "not the act of a friend" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia will however not retaliate against the announced 10-percent tariff with its own trade duties, the prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the act of a friend," Albanese told a news conference after Trump's tariff announcement, saying one in four Australian jobs depended on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Australian leader, who faces a tightly contested general election on May 3, said Australia charged nothing on US imports and should face zero US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has been Australia's strongest military ally since World War II, and the two countries have joined with Britain in a deal to provide Australia's navy with stealthy nuclear-powered submarines.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new measures could change how people see their relationship, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations long-standing friendship," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship," the Australian leader added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian blue-chip stocks dipped nearly two percent in early trade as one of the first global markets reacted to Trump's trade action. (AFP)

    Barca oust Atlético, set up Clasico Copa del Rey final

<img alt="Ferran Torres celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Spanish Copa del Rey semi-final second leg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798723_1_20250403061233.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona will face rivals Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final after Ferran Torres secured them a 1-0 win at Atlético Madrid, progressing 5-4 on aggregate from the semi-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Record 31-time winners Barca had the better of the clash at the Metropolitano stadium after the wild 4-4 first leg draw, and defeat leaves Diego Simeone's Atlético with little to play for in the rest of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Catalans are on the hunt for a potential quadruple and are unbeaten in 2025, stretching their run to 21 games without defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were the last team to triumph against Barcelona, winning before Christmas to go top of La Liga, but they now trail Hansi Flick's team by nine points with nine matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come," Torres said. "If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul.
  <br>
  <br>
  César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  With four minutes of stoppage time added on Atlético turned the screw, with Musso coming up for a late De Paul free-kick, but Barcelona held off the hosts to progress. (AFP)

<img alt="More volatility is expected, with US futures moving decisively lower late Wednesday after Trump announced his tariffs plan. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798722_1_20250403060921.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks whipped through another dizzying day on Wednesday in the final hours before President Donald Trump’s unveiling of tariffs promised as part of his Liberation Day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,670, but only after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1 percent and a later gain of 1.1 percent. It’s had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 235 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 42,225, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 percent to close at 17,601. Both also veered from sharply lower in the morning to sharply higher in the afternoon before doubling back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla helped knock the market around after initially falling more than 6 percent following a report that it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last year’s first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla is one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of its immense size, and it’s faced backlash due to anger about CEO Elon Musk’s leading the US government’s efforts to cut spending. But its stock erased its loss from the morning and ended with a gain of 5.3 percent following a report from Politico that Trump has told others that Musk will step back from his government role in coming weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 percent tax on imports from China, a 20 percent tax on imports from the European Union, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the companies whose shares fell in after-hours trading were Deckers Outdoor, the maker of Uggs, down 9.3 percent; Lululemon was down 8.8 percent; and home products retailer Williams-Sonoma was down 8.4 percent. (AP)

    Tesla sales slump as pressure piles on Musk

<img alt="The number of autos delivered globally dropped by 13 percent in the first three months of 2025. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798709_1_20250403033051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla's worldwide sales tumbled in the first quarter, figures showed on Wednesday, piling further pressure on CEO Elon Musk who faces a growing backlash for his role overseeing US federal spending cuts under President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk's electric vehicle company delivered 336,681 autos globally in the first three months of 2025, a drop of 13 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quarterly figures were the lowest in nearly three years and lagged analyst expectations, as Tesla pointed to the "loss of several weeks of production" while it ramps up upgrades for its Model Y output.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla shares initially fell more than six percent, but they bounced following a news report that Trump will soon scale back Musk's involvement, viewing him as a political liability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, the world's richest person, donated some US$270 million to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump was elected, Musk launched the "Department of Government Efficiency" or Doge, which has become a lightening rod over its murky legal standing and questions about Musk's conflicts of interest and public accountability as an unelected figure driving radical change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Trump returned to the White House, Tesla has been targeted for consumer boycotts and vandalism as its chief executive has helped engineer thousands of job cuts across the US government while aggressively attacking Trump critics on the Musk-owned X social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wedbush's Dan Ives, a prominent technology analyst and longtime believer in Tesla's growth potential, called the figures "a disaster on every metric," according to a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a fork in the road moment," said Ives, who has called for Musk to publicly outline how he is balancing his Tesla commitments with his work for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The more political he gets... the more the brand suffers, there is no debate. This quarter was an example of the damage Musk is causing Tesla," he added, calling early 2025 "a moment of truth" for Musk and his car company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ives and other long-term Tesla bulls have viewed the EV maker as poised for potentially massive growth, viewing Musk as a guru in state-of-the-art autonomous driving and artificial intelligence technology expected to play a growing role for the foreseeable future. (AFP)

    Myanmar junta declares quake ceasefire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar's junta announced a temporary ceasefire on Wednesday as the death toll from a devastating earthquake rose and desperate survivors pleaded for more help amid frantic scenes of aid distribution.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing nearly 3,000 people and making thousands more homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military government said it would observe a ceasefire from Wednesday until April 22 to make quake relief efforts easier, after other armed groups fighting the country's bloody four-year civil war made similar pledges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups and several foreign governments had earlier condemned the junta for continuing to carry out air strikes even as the country grappled with the quake aftermath.
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta said in a statement the ceasefire had "the aim of speeding up relief and reconstruction efforts, and maintaining peace and stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  But it warned its opponents - a complex array of pro-democracy and ethnic minority armed groups - it would still respond to attacks, acts of sabotage or "gathering, organising, and expanding territory that would undermine peace".
  <br>
  <br>
  The junta also said leader Min Aung Hlaing will travel to Bangkok on Thursday for a summit of South Asian countries plus Myanmar and Thailand, where he will discuss the quake response. (AFP)

    Trump unveils sweeping global tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a raft of punishing tariffs targeting countries around the world including some of its closest trading partners, in a move that risks sparking a ruinous trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the White House Rose Garden against a backdrop of US flags, Trump slapped the most stinging tariffs on China and the European Union on what he called "Liberation Day."
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar fell one percent against the euro and slipped against other major currencies as Trump was speaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump reserved some of the heaviest blows for what he called the "nations that treat us badly", including 20 percent on key ally the European Union and 24 percent on Japan.  He also slapped 34 percent on goods from China, on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 78-year-old Republican – who held up a chart with a list of levies – said that he was "very kind" and so was only imposing half the amount that those countries taxed US exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the rest, Trump said he would impose a "baseline" tariff of 10 percent, including Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  An audience of cabinet members, as well as workers in hard hats from industries including steel, oil and gas, whooped and cheered as Trump said the tariffs would "make America wealthy again."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is Liberation Day," Trump said, adding that it would "forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House told reporters that a "baseline" 10 percent tariff would start on 12:01am EST on April 5, while higher rates on various partners would begin from 12:01am EST on April 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent Simon Marks said many nations would now be looking to strike deals with Trump's administration to reduce the tariffs' impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump's] definitely left the door open for all sorts of nations to try an negotiate with him to come and beseech him to step back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no question that Donald Trump is now presiding over the most protectionist US government that the world has seen since the 1930s," Marks added. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stuttgart set up a German Cup final clash with third-division Arminia Bielefeld after a 3-1 win over RB Leipzig.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Berlin," Hoeness said. "Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved closer to the Premier League title with a 1-0 win in the Merseyside derby against Everton, while Manchester City beat Leicester 2-0 to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak met Jacob Murphy's cross with a typically predatory strike in first-half stoppage time at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford levelled through Bryan Mbeumo's 66th-minute penalty after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope tripped Yoane Wissa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sandro Tonali lashed home from Harvey Barnes' assist in the 74th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa also remain in the hunt for a Champions League place after winning 3-0 at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford struck in the 51st minute, accelerating onto Morgan Rogers' pass for his third goal in his last two games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Asensio killed off Brighton in the 78th minute and Donyell Malen netted in added time to lift Villa into seventh place, two points behind Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Southampton wasted a chance to avoid becoming the worst team in Premier League history after a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at St Mary's. (AFP)

    Israel to seize 'large areas' of Gaza

<img alt="Israel carries out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798686_1_20250402213633.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel said on Wednesday it would expand its military operations and seize "large areas" of the Gaza Strip where rescuers said 34 people were killed in Israeli strikes, including on a United Nations building.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would bolster its military presence in the Palestinian territory to "destroy and clear the area of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure".
  <br>
  <br>
  The operation would "seize large areas that will be incorporated into Israeli security zones", he said in a statement, without specifying how much territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 19 people were killed, including nine children, when an Israeli strike "targeted an UNRWA (UN agency for Palestinian refugees) building housing a medical clinic in Jabalia refugee camp".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said in a statement that it struck Hamas militants "inside a command and control centre" in north Gaza's Jabalia. It separately confirmed the building housed a UN clinic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian foreign ministry, based in the occupied West Bank, condemned the "massacre at the UNRWA clinic in Jabalia" and called for "serious international pressure" to halt Israel's widening offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has on several occasions conducted strikes on UNRWA buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for most of the past 18 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel also carried out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza on Wednesday. The civil defence said dawn strikes killed at least 13 people in Khan Yunis and two in Nuseirat refugee camp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Katz warned last week that the military would soon "operate with full force" in more parts of Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, he announced plans for an agency to oversee the "voluntary departure" of Palestinians from the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  That followed Israel's backing of a proposal from US President Donald Trump for the United States to take over the territory after relocating its 2.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. The proposal outraged Gazans and drew widespread international condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 before launching a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire. (AFP)

    Govt seeks interest in ecotourism projects

<img alt="The government wants to develop Pak Nai into an ecotourism destination. Photo: Development Bureau" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798669_1_20250402192137.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau announced on Wednesday that it is inviting expressions of interest for three major ecotourism projects in outlying islands and coastal areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time in recent years that the government has released large areas of land to build new attractions for tourism and recreation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The projects are: transforming the Ex-Lamma Quarry site into a high-end lakeside resort; developing a new Eco-Recreation Corridor in South Lantau; and creating ecotourism nodes at Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesperson said officials are seeking market input before starting statutory planning procedures, to ensure the projects better align with market interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ex-Lamma Quarry project envisions a luxury resort complex featuring a 5-hectare artificial lake, a marina that can accommodate 150 to 200 yachts, as well as low-density housing development.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure coordinated planning, officials aim to have a single developer manage the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 9.3-hectare South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor – spanning Cheung Sha, Pui O, Shui Hau and Shek Pik – will feature adventure resorts and ecotourism facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers may choose to develop the entire corridor or focus on individual facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tsim Bei Tsui and Pak Nai nodes, covering 87 and 33 hectares respectively, will become tourist spots featuring restaurants, wellness centres and holiday resorts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Multiple developers can participate in this project, and local villagers will have the opportunity to become business partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau will hold briefing sessions for each project on April 14, and interested parties have until July 2 to submit their expressions of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the three projects are expected to cost tens of billions of dollars each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government plans to open the Ex-Lamma Quarry project for bidding in the second half of 2026, and expects it will take around six to seven years to complete.

<img alt="CK Hutchison has announced plans to sell its ports, including assets along the Panama Canal. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798683_1_20250402211035.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Wednesday reposted an article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper voicing opposition to CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports, including strategic assets along the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article said CK Hutchison is an important Hong Kong-based firm, and it should bear its basic responsibilities and fix its mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece included views from various political and business leaders, including vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former chief executive CY Leung who said national interests are most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  He questioned if the US government would give the green light if China wants to buy US chip enterprises and the firms are willing to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said on Wednesday more suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 52-year-old man in Fo Tan last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  One of the suspects is a 25-year-old man who was taken into custody in Thailand earlier and has since returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he was arrested near Pattaya and sent back to the SAR on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police believe he was one of two people who carried out the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday afternoon, the suspect was taken to Fo Tan where officers reconstructed the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers said he will be charged soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also revealed that two others were arrested earlier on suspicion of assisting offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, eight out of the nine suspects linked to the case have been arrested by Hong Kong or mainland police, including a 76-year-old man and his son who allegedly planned the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a media briefing, superintendent Li Muk-yik said the remaining suspect, who allegedly served as a lookout, had fled to the mainland and remains at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the force was able to identify all the suspects after going through surveillance cameras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that the probe has been challenging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The suspects [allegedly] put fake licence plates on taxis [as they fled]. They were very cautious before and after the incident," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had [allegedly] changed their clothes and the vehicles several times after they fled."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said the case was triggered by disputes over money.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue teams from the SAR and the mainland have joined hands in finding a survivor in the quake-rattled Myanmar city of Mandalay.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

    Tibet tourist numbers soar to all-time high

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitor numbers to the Tibet region reached 63 million last year, its highest ever.
 <br>
  <br>
  Travel agencies in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said more people from the SAR have visited Tibet since the launch of a direct flight in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Potala Palace in Lhasa is considered a must-see attraction by many travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Kunga Tashi, deputy director at the palace's management office, said the number of tourists has increased notably after the pandemic, rising by up to 30 percent each year over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are moves to limit the number of visitors, to ensure better tourism experience and protect the landmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at 2024, the number of trips was about 2.01 million. We have set restrictions on the visitor headcount to the palace, capped at 7,000 each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visits by Hong Kong travellers to Tibet is on the rise after a direct flight service between the SAR and Lhasa was launched in late February.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after Beijing announced the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme last year to allow residents from Lhasa to visit the SAR on a solo basis, instead of being part of a tour group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some SAR agencies told RTHK more people have expressed interest in heading to Tibet since the launch of the direct flight, and group tours have been fully booked through May.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong visitor travelling to Lhasa told RTHK that she enjoyed visiting the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just arrived from the Nyingchi area... I think Lhasa is a must-visit city if you travel to Tibet," she said.

<img alt="The 17-year-old is alleged to have targeted five mosques in Singapore as part of his plan to kill at least 100 Muslims. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798653_1_20250402175858.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Singaporean teenager allegedly planning to kill dozens of Muslims outside several mosques has been detained, the city-state's Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old boy was detained in March, the ISD said in a statement, adding that he had regarded white supremacist Brenton Tarrant – who in 2019 had killed worshippers at mosques in New Zealand – as a "hero".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD also said he had "identified as an 'East Asian supremacist'", and had decided on five mosques across Singapore for his post-Friday prayer attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This boy wanted to kill at least 100 Muslims, so that he can kill more Muslims than Tarrant had killed. He also wanted to live-stream his attacks," Home Minister K Shanmugam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he was arrested... he had already made a number of attempts to get a gun. He told ISD quite openly if he had gotten a gun, he would have carried out his attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The teen had been in online contact with 18-year-old Nick Lee, who was detained in December for having similar plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The multicultural country has seen several cases in recent years where young Singaporeans have been detained for allegedly making attack plans following exposure to extremist content online.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, authorities arrested a teenage boy who was allegedly planning an Islamic State group-inspired stabbing attack at a busy suburb.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same statement Wednesday, the ISD also said a 15-year-old girl was placed under a restriction order in February, forbidding her from travelling nor having access to the internet without the approval of the ISD director.
  <br>
  <br>
  It alleged that between July 2023 and December 2024, the girl was in at least eight short-term romantic online relationships with overseas-based Islamic State group supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She went to pledge allegiance to an ISIS chatbot," said Shanmugam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She wanted to fight and die for ISIS, she looked up flights to go to Syria, she thought of how she was going to save money to plan for her travels."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the trend of rising radicalism and extremism of young people via the internet was "concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  ISD said "self-radicalisation can happen very quickly".
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the case of the 15-year-old, it only took weeks," it said, appealing for the public to "be vigilant to signs". (AFP)

 China strongly urges all parties in Myanmar to ensure the safety of earthquake relief workers and supplies from China and other countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to a query at a daily press briefing, Guo Jiakun said relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China have arrived in Myanmar and are on their way to the disaster-stricken area of Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, relief workers and supplies are safe," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Myanmar's junta said earlier in the day that its troops had fired warning shots when a Chinese Red Cross convoy failed to stop while approaching a conflict area to deliver aid to earthquake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group of nine vehicles was approaching Ommati village in northern Shan State on Tuesday night, and failed to stop when signalled by soldiers, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a distance of around 200 metres, security forces used a light to try to halt them but they did not stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security forces fired three gunshots aiming at the sky."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue workers have been coming in to Myanmar, including from its close ally China, since Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake, which has killed close to 2,800 people and left thousands homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  But access to the worst-hit areas has been hindered by wrecked roads, poor telecommunications and ongoing violence between the junta and rebel militias.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaw Min Tun said the convoy belonged to the Chinese Red Cross and that the junta was investigating the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shan state has been the scene of intense fighting between the junta and ethnic minority armed groups which have seized control of large areas of territory. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China on Wednesday warned the Philippines against threatening "regional peace" after the United States said it had approved the possible sale of US$5.58 billion in F-16 fighter jets to Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Philippines' defence and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department said it was green-lighting a sale that includes 20 F-16 jets and related equipment to the Philippines, a treaty-bound ally of the United States. (AFP)

 The psychological well-being of Hong Kong's secondary school pupils improved slightly in the last academic year but was still worse than before the pandemic, the Department of Health said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 430,000 children in primary and secondary education received student health services in the 2023/24 school year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the department's annual report shows 2.8 percent of secondary pupils reported having had plans to take their own lives, while 1.3 percent said they had actually attempted suicide.
  <br>
  <br>
  This figures were up from the 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent recorded in 2018/19.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is self-reported, so it may not represent the whole story. Some students may not wish to tell in the questionnaire... It may be underestimated or overestimated," said community medicine consultant Chuang Shuk-kwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they say yes to the attempted suicide or planned suicide, we are very concerned and we will provide them individual counselling, and if necessary, we will refer them to the specialist or even A&E departments, if there is indeed an emergency."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Chuang also said that over 40 percent of primary school students and 80 percent of secondary school students spent two or more hours per day using electronic screens for recreational purposes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the increased screen time among students may worsen their vision.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce chief Algernon Yau on Wednesday stressed that merging the city's public broadcaster and the government's public relations office might not be the most effective way to cut expenditure, saying the two bodies do not overlap in their functions.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to questions from lawmaker Junius Ho on the feasibility of combining RTHK and the Information Services Department (ISD), the secretary for commerce and economic development said a merger might be "counterproductive" when it comes to the administration's overall public relations work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Merging the two departments with distinct functions may not be the most effective way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in terms of overall operations," he told the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public may confuse the role of RTHK, as a public service broadcaster, with that of the ISD, as the government promoter. This may be counterproductive to the government's overall public relations works, which is not advisable."
  <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Regina Ip said the two departments should increase the use of artificial intelligence to reduce manpower, suggesting there could be redundancy given her past interviews with the public broadcaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said in response that RTHK has been using artificial intelligence to produce its programmes to cut spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another lawmaker, Carmen Kan, urged RTHK to better promote the administration's policies, to which the commerce minister said the public broadcaster is introducing a brand new show on top of existing current affairs programmes.

 Chinese electric vehicle battery giant CATL said on Wednesday that it will partner with state-owned oil giant Sinopec to build 10,000 battery swap stations.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a strategic deal signed in Beijing, the two companies will build at least 500 battery swap stations this year, according to a company statement, which did not give a timeline to set up these stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership will be based on CATL's "choco-swap" battery swapping and Qiji chassis battery-swapping solution to "break through the driving range bottlenecks of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks," the company said. (Reuters)

 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she believes new police commissioner Joe Chow will lead the force effectively.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who's also the New People's Party chairwoman, congratulated Chow on his appointment.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is not too familiar with him, but has observed his performance in the Executive Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because of his rich experience in policing, along with his good cooperation with Raymond Siu, who has just stepped down from his post, I am very confident that he will definitely lead the force effectively by upholding the spirit of honour, duty and loyalty," Ip said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States hitting another six SAR and mainland officials with sanctions this week, Ip said Chow would be dedicated to his duties and unaffected by such intimidation if he were also to be sanctioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, former security minister Lai Tung-kwok, who's now a New People's Party lawmaker, pointed out that Chow is a "very suitable candidate" for the position.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief joined the force in 1995 and rose through the ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai told RTHK that all through the force's history the post of commissioner has always been filled from within its ranks "for very obvious reasons".
  <br>
  <br>
  The police, he said, "needs an experienced and capable officer to lead the force, and they have a very well-established succession plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given Joe's long outstanding service within the force, I think he is a very suitable candidate."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of Chow's key targets is to promote smart policing, which Lai said is crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because smart policing is the only viable solution for the force to deliver the best performance with limited, or even reduced, allocations of resources available within the government, he added.

 China's embassy in Bangkok called on the country's companies operating abroad to comply with local laws after a Chinese construction firm came under scrutiny over a deadly building collapse in Friday's earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-storey skyscraper, set to house Thai government offices, collapsed in Bangkok when a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to investigate where the mistake happened," said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials used at the construction site and its safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened from the beginning since it was designed?" she said earlier. "How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The development near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No 10 Engineering Group (Thailand), an offshoot of China Railway Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand late on Tuesday expressed "deepest condolences" for the collapse and urged firms to "strictly" comply with Thai laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has consistently urged Chinese companies overseas to abide by local laws and contribute positively to the society," it said in a Facebook post only in Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has dispatched a team of rescue experts and disaster relief personnel to assist in Bangkok and vowed to "continue supporting Thailand as needed", it added. (AFP)

    National security among new police chief's priorities

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newly appointed Commissioner of Police Joe Chow has vowed to prioritise safeguarding national security, modernising law enforcement and consolidating team culture in the force.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the media after succeeding Raymond Siu on Wednesday, Chow emphasised the importance of enhancing public awareness of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After five years of the enactment of the national security law, I think, still, the society or even some members of the public... we want them to understand more about what we mean by national security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is by far the most important because after all we understand... if we don't have any national security, I don't think that we have a very stable society at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief also said he would prioritise smart policing initiatives by leveraging technology to improve operational efficiency, work effectiveness and the quality of services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the need to cultivate cohesion within the force by fostering shared values and the sense of belonging through improved career development opportunities and more comprehensive support to officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about recent sanctions imposed on his predecessor, Chow stressed the importance of focusing on enhancing police operations amid adversity, rather than succumbing to fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think everyone can see that the US government has used sanctions, which is a barbaric tactic, in an attempt to intimidate public officials, especially members of the police force," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Its objective is to suppress us and divert our focus from national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This very reaction underscores that the measures we are implementing are effective and successful. Thus, it becomes even more important for us to intensify our efforts"
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow added that he will lead the police force with unwavering courage to confront the challenges.

<img alt="Police officers get ready for a potential showdown on Friday between pro and anti-Yoon supporters near the entrance of the Constitutional Court in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798612_1_20250402141524.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police will mobilise "all available resources" to prevent violence when a court rules on Friday on the fate of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, with top tourist sites to close and embassies warning citizens to stay away.
 <br>
  <br>
  The country's Constitutional Court will issue a ruling on whether to strip Yoon of office over his abortive declaration of martial law, which has already seen him suspended by lawmakers and arrested on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court in downtown Seoul has become a flashpoint, with near-constant protests in the area until the police moved on Tuesday to seal off the streets to head off possible clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation has become more grave than ever," Lee Ho-young, acting chief of the Korean National Police Agency, said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of thousands of people for and against Yoon have poured onto Seoul's streets every weekend, with die-hards on each side also setting up tent camps and staging all-night protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are concerned that whatever verdict is announced, some people "may become agitated and engage in extreme or violent protests", said Lee during a meeting with top police officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's supporters stormed a court building in January after a judge extended the suspended president's detention. He was later released from custody on procedural grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police will mobilise all available resources to ensure the safety of the public and to prevent the situation from escalating into serious social conflict," said Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Seoul, more than 14,000 riot police will be deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen nearby schools and several shops in the neighbourhood will close on the day of the verdict due to safety issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tourist sites such as the Gyeongbok and Changdeok palaces, within walking distances from the court, will also be shuttered, the Korean Heritage Service said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Seoul warned its nationals to keep away from local political protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not participate, do not linger, do not watch," it posted on its social media channels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do not publicly express or forward political comments, and try to avoid verbal or physical confrontations with local people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Han Duck-soo urged political leaders to refrain from making remarks that could incite or encourage illegal protests or violence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regardless of the outcome, we must calmly and rationally accept the court's decision," he said during a meeting with ministry officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is a time to prioritise the stability and survival of our community over political advantages or disadvantages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is stripped of office by the court, it will trigger elections which must be held within 60 days. (AFP)

 Rescuers on Wednesday pulled a man alive from the rubble five days after Myanmar's devastating earthquake, as calls grew for the junta to allow more aid in and halt attacks on rebels.
 <br>
  <br>
  The shallow 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Friday flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing more than 2,700 people and making thousands more homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several leading armed groups fighting the military have suspended hostilities during the quake recovery, but junta chief Min Aung Hlaing vowed to continue "defensive activities" against "terrorists".
  <br>
  <br>
  UN agencies, rights groups and foreign governments have urged all sides in Myanmar's civil war to stop fighting and focus on helping those affected by the quake, the biggest to hit the country in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of finding more survivors are fading, but there was a moment of joy on Wednesday as a man was pulled alive from the ruins of a hotel in the capital Naypyidaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old hotel worker was extracted by a joint Myanmar-Turkish team shortly after midnight, the fire service and junta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dazed and dusty but conscious, the man was pulled through a hole in the rubble and put on a stretcher, video posted on Facebook by the Myanmar Fire Services Department shows. (AFP)

    Actor Val Kilmer loses bout with pnemonia

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American actor Val Kilmer, who was first propelled to fame with "Top Gun" and went on to starring roles as Batman and Jim Morrison, has died at age 65, the New York Times reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The cause of death was pneumonia, his daughter Mercedes Kilmer told the Times on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said he had been diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a stage actor, Kilmer got his start on the big screen with Cold War spoof "Top Secret!" in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two years later, he gained fame as the cocky, if mostly silent aviator Iceman in "Top Gun", playing a rival to Tom Cruise's Maverick.
  <br>
  <br>
  A versatile actor whose career spanned decades, Kilmer got a shot at leading man roles in Oliver Stone's "The Doors" and took a turn as the masked Gotham vigilante in "Batman Forever", playing Bruce Wayne after Michael Keaton and before George Clooney.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer was the youngest person ever accepted to New York's fabled Juilliard school and longed to make serious films. But he found himself in a series of schlocky blockbusters and expensive flops in the early 2000s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chastened by a decade or more of low-budget movies, he was mounting a comeback in the 2010s with a successful stage show about Mark Twain that he hoped to turn into a film, when he was struck by cancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Val", a documentary about his stratospheric rise and later fall in Hollywood showed him rasping for air, premiered at the Cannes film festival in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kilmer recently returned to movie theaters in 2021 with a cameo reprising his role as Iceman in "Top Gun: Maverick", the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 hit. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney beachfront properties were flooded and coastal infrastructure damaged after a large swell combined with a king tide to batter the Australian shore, officials said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Several homes were evacuated at Botany Bay in Sydney’s south around midnight as waves surged across the coast, according to New South Wales State Emergency Service spokesman Andrew Edmunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further north at Sydney’s premier Bondi Beach, the coast was lashed by a 5.5-metre swell, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Windows were shattered at Bondi Icebergs Swimming Club, a waterfront pool, gymnasium and restaurant complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV footage showed waves bursting through glass doors after 11 pm on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It has just been devastating,” club general manager Bob Tate said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’ve been a member for 50 years at Bondi. I’ve never seen this sort of thing before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You know, the sheer magnitude of the level of water and the power of the water coming through must’ve just been horrendous.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tate added that on the pool deck around 15 glass panels were splintered, floors were damaged, and cupboards and firehoses were ripped off the walls. It was “quite extraordinary,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  South of Botany Bay at Cronulla Beach, lifeguard Steve Winner said the beach, along with parts of the pavement behind it and electrical infrastructure, had been damaged by four-metre waves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities warned on Wednesday of further hazardous surf with the potential to cause coastal erosion and damage from the Illawarra region south of Sydney to the Hunter region north of Sydney. (AP)

    Beijing puts store in EVs for shoring up power grids

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China plans to launch pilot projects in nine cities that would use the country's growing fleet of electric vehicles as batteries to shore up power supply on the grid during spikes in demand, according to a government announcement on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows on rules issued last year by state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to strengthen the integration of new energy vehicles with the grid amid concerns the rapid adoption of EVs would overwhelm the generation and transmission systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grid-connected cars could also adjust their charging times to avoid peak periods and provide critical services such as frequency regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing those services could potentially become an alternative revenue stream for homeowners or operators of charging stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the notice, power grid companies are responsible for setting up the pilots, and provincial governments should lead the development of charging facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The energy regulator is tasked with supporting the participation of grid-connected vehicle applications in power trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, NDRC said it would set up over 50 pilot programmes by 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, industry experts say there are a range of hurdles to overcome before the large-scale adoption of V2G, such as developing viable business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  NDRC also said in the 2024 rule that battery technologies need to be improved. (Reuters)

    Trump-backed candidate loses Wisconsin court election

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Democratic-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court defeated a challenger endorsed by US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, touting her victory as a win against powerful interests and cementing a liberal majority for at least three more years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Susan Crawford, a Dane County judge who led legal fights to protect union power and abortion rights and to oppose voter ID, stood on stage surrounded by the court's four current liberal justices and celebrated her win as a victory for democracy while also taking a dig at Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I would be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said. “And we won.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and groups he backed had spent more than US$21 million in an effort to defeat Crawford. Musk even traveled to Wisconsin two days before the election to personally hand over US$1 million checks to two voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” Crawford said in her victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price, our courts are not for sale.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford defeated Republican-backed Brad Schimel in a race that broke records for spending, was the highest-turnout Wisconsin Supreme Court election ever and became a proxy fight for the nation’s political battles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk was silent on his X platform in the wake of Crawford’s victory, reposting a message about Vietnam and tariffs but nothing on the Supreme Court contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, Musk and other Republicans lined up behind Schimel, a former state attorney general.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats including former president Barack Obama and billionaire megadonor George Soros backed Crawford .
  <br>
  <br>
  The first major election in the country since November was seen as a litmus test of how voters feel about Trump’s first months back in office and the role played by Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has torn through federal agencies and laid off thousands of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk traveled to Wisconsin on Sunday to make a pitch for Schimel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford was beating Schimel by more than eight points, based on unofficial results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turnout exceeded 52 percent of the voting age population, topping the record set in 2023 of nearly 40 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spending was on its way to surpass US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel told his supporters he had conceded to Crawford, leading to yells of anger. One woman began to chant, “Cheater, cheater!”
  <br>
  <br>
  “No,” Schimel said. “You’ve got to accept the results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The court can decide election-related laws and settle disputes over future election outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford embraced the backing of Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights advocates, running ads that highlighted Schimel’s opposition to the procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also attacked Schimel for his ties to Musk and Republicans, referring to Musk as “Elon Schimel” during a debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schimel’s campaign tried to portray Crawford as weak on crime and puppet of Democrats who, if elected, would push to redraw congressional district boundary lines to hurt Republicans and repeal a GOP-backed state law that took collective bargaining rights away from most public workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voters in Eau Claire seemed to respond to both messages. Jim Seeger, a 68-year-old retiree, said he voted for Schimel because he was concerned about redistricting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jim Hazelton, a 68-year-old disabled veteran, said he had planned to abstain but voted for Crawford after Musk, whom he called a “pushy billionaire”,  and Trump got involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s cutting everything,” Hazelton said of Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  “People need these things he’s cutting.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford’s win keeps the court under a 4-3 liberal majority, as it has been since 2023. A liberal justice is not up for election again until April 2028, ensuring liberals will either maintain or increase their hold on the court until then.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crawford thanked each of the current liberal justices and hugged each of them after her win. One of the four is retiring, creating the open seat she won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court likely will be deciding cases on abortion, public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Who controls the court also could factor into how it might rule on any future voting challenge in the perennial presidential battleground state, which raised the stakes of the race for national Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump endorsed Schimel just 11 days before the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to congressional lines, but Schimel and Musk have said that if Crawford won, the court would redraw congressional districts to make them more favorable to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, 22-year-old college student Kenneth Gifford said he feels that Trump has done damage to American institutions and that Musk is trying to buy votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want an actual, respectable democracy,” he said. (AP)

    Drivers' pay rises once joining taxi fleet: operator
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798583_1_20250402114151.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of a licensed taxi fleet said drivers’ income had significantly increased since the launch of a new premium cab scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  But it also expressed concern there were not enough cabbies participating.
  <br>
  <br>
  To improve the quality of taxi services, the Transport Department has granted conditional licences to five operators to form premium fleets.
  <br>
  <br>
  SynCab is among two fleets that have piloted a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  People who reserve a ride from a licensed fleet of premium taxis can opt to not pay by the meter and negotiate a fare with the driver instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Wednesday, the company’s executive director, Sonia Cheng, said their fleet began operations in January and they had already noted a rise in drivers’ income.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When we look at the numbers, average drivers used to be paid, for example, HK$146 when they charge by the meter. For orders in our fleet, the average fare can reach HK$268. This is 84 percent higher than the usual drivers. Over the past three months, we have provided 44,000 passenger trips,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said 30 percent of their customers made bookings on their ride hailing platform and this is one thing many drivers struggle to adjust to as they used to take instant orders from people flagging down a taxi on the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the timeline for starting a full operation, she said their fleet currently has about 100 taxis and needs at least 150 more to fulfil the government's requirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same programme, Ho Chi-keung from the Motor Transport Workers General Union said from his understanding, drivers were not so enthusiastic about joining a licensed fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are three main reasons: firstly, they got used to their current work mode. They may face problems with their roster after joining a fleet,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Secondly, it's about the holidays. Some drivers are now working three or four days a week, so it could be hard for them to adjust. It’s also about the deposit. They may need to pay a deposit once joining the fleet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  "That’s why drivers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said fleet operators should be more proactive in approaching the drivers and to explain to them the relevant terms, including whether a basic salary and holiday are provided and whether there's an employment relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department has said that the five operators need to commence full services by July to receive the official licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, transport minister Mable Chan said the department has allowed room for fleet operators and drivers to negotiate how they collaborate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fleet operators should have their own ideas in how to attract drivers. I hope improvements can be made through greater market competition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall speaking, when the Transport Department granted the conditional licences earlier, we cautiously reviewed the individual proposals. We preserved some flexibility," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers and operators may not establish an employment relationship. But they share the same vision."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has high hopes that the operators will be well-prepared by July.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stephen Curry scored 52 points and Draymond Green added a triple-double as the Golden State Warriors clinched a crucial 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible," Kerr said. "Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. "I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a sight to behold how he operates," Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him," he continued. "I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now," Iisalo said. "It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish. (AFP)

    'Subsidised homes give hope to youngsters'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Wednesday said authorities are rolling out about 50,000 subsidised residential flats in the next five years to make it easier for youngsters to own a home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Overview Policy programme, Ho said although it is difficult for young people to afford a private residential flat, the mindset that youngsters needed to start queuing for public housing when they are 18 years old must be changed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Highlighting the importance of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) flats, she said it is essential to have a continuous housing supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho pointed out the government had rolled out 9,000, 8,000 and 7,000 HOS flats in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively, adding that the flats the government has in the pipeline could give them hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Looking ahead, we will gradually roll out 45,000 units in the next five years, with the supply from Hong Kong Housing Society, there could be nearly 50,000 flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It will give hope for young people to afford to buy their own home, and to strive for upward social mobility, so they won’t try lowering their income just to comply with the asset limits for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the average price for last year’s HOS flats was HK$2.7 million, and people can get a mortgage of up to 90 percent from banks, meaning they need to save over HK$300,000 for a downpayment with a monthly repayment of around HK$11,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not that unattainable,” Ho added.

 A 25-year-old Hong Kong man wanted by the police for his alleged involvement in a murder in Fo Tan last month has been arrested in Pattaya, Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  He will be deported from the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai media quoted the country's Immigration Bureau as saying that officers made the arrest at a rented house in a beach town on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, identified only as Truong, was with his Thai girlfriend at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was reported that Hong Kong authorities had sought assistance from Thailand after an arrest warrant was issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 52-year-old man was certified dead after an attack by two men on Lai Wo Lane last month.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Joe Chow takes over as new police chief from his retiring predecessor Raymond Siu. Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Police Force" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798573_1_20250402103051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has named Joe Chow as the new Commissioner of Police, replacing Raymond Siu.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chow was appointed by the State Council following a nomination and suggestion put forward by Chief Executive John Lee, according to Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He takes over the reins of the force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new police chief joined the force in 1995 as an inspector and spent most of his career in criminal investigation and intelligence gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was assigned temporarily to Interpol in France between 2012 and 2013 as a criminal intelligence officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow, who had been a deputy regional commander of Kowloon West at one stage, was known for leading a police operation at the Polytechnic University during the 2019 protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  He further rose through the ranks with a series of promotions since 2020 and assumed the number-two position in the force by 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  As deputy police chief, his public appearances included hosting press conferences relating to test runs for the Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to Chow's "extensive experience" in a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has a distinguished performance and possesses proven leadership skills. I am confident that he will capably lead the police force in meeting the challenges ahead," he said.
  <br>

  Siu ends his decades-long career with the force by taking his leave on Wednesday. He first took charge of the force in 2021 and had his tenure extended by two years when he reached the retirement age in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Lee's statement, the chief executive expressed heartfelt appreciation, saying: "Since taking up the appointment as Commissioner of Police in June 2021, Mr Siu has made commendable efforts in maintaining Hong Kong as one of the safest cities in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has demonstrated unswerving dedication and determination to safeguarding Hong Kong and upholding the rule of law in dealing with the social unrest... Under his eminent leadership, the police force has continued to excel as a world-class professional law enforcement agency."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Democratic US lawmaker shattered a record for the longest speech in Senate history, staying on his feet for more than 25 hours to deliver a fiery protest against President Donald Trump's "unconstitutional" actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senator Cory Booker's display of endurance – to hold the floor he had to remain standing and could not even go to the bathroom – recalled the famous scene in Frank Capra's 1939 film classic "Mr Smith Goes to Washington."
  <br>
  <br>
  The longest Senate speech on record before Booker's feat on Tuesday was delivered by South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, only the fourth Black senator to be popularly elected to the body, blew past that deadline, his voice still strong but emotional as he topped out at 25 hours and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The public galleries of the Senate chamber gradually filled as the moment he broke the record approached, with more Democratic lawmakers joining the session – although Republicans largely stayed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a moral moment. It's not left or right. It's right or wrong," Booker said as he wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also quoted his mentor John Lewis, a 1960s civil rights movement leader, who urged campaigners to get into "good trouble," before finally pronouncing "Madam President, I yield the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 55-year-old New Jersey native had found a moment for some humour as he passed the record, joking: "I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  A handful of people gathered outside the US Capitol brandishing signs with messages like "Thank you Senator Booker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Booker's talk-a-thon was not actually blocking the majority Republican Party from holding votes in the Senate, as would be the case in a true filibuster, his defiance quickly became a rallying point for beleaguered Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker, a former presidential candidate, seized command in the chamber at 7 pm on Monday (7 am Hong Kong time on Tuesday) and finished at 8:05 pm on Tuesday (8:05 am on Wednesday).
  <br>
  <br>
  He lashed out at Trump's radical cost-cutting policies that have seen his top advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, slash entire government programs without consent from Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The senator said Trump's aggressive seizing of ever-more executive power had put US democracy at risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds," Booker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And institutions which are special in America, which are precious and which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In just 71 days the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans' safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had words of encouragement for Trump opponents, saying as he concluded that "the power of the people is greater than the people in power."
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker later went into detail about how he withstood the physical demands of the speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My strategy was to stop eating. I think I stopped eating Friday and then to stop drinking the night before I started on Monday," he said in the Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  The approach "had its benefits and had its really downsides... different muscle groups start to really cramp up" with dehydration, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement sent by his office, Booker added that he was "tired and a little hoarse."
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic lawmakers, in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have struggled over how to blunt Trump's efforts to downsize government, ramp up deportations and shred much of the country's political norms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to thank you for holding vigil for this country all night," Senator Raphael Warnock told Booker on the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booker dedicated much of his speech to criticizing Trump's policies, but to pass the time he also recited poetry, discussed sports and entertained questions from colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you love your neighbor, if you love this country, show your love. Stop them from doing what they're trying to [do]," he said. (AFP)
