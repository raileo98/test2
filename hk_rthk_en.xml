<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said on Thursday that the government cannot make the lives of carers better on its own and all sectors must work together to support them.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun said he is pleased to see that various NGOs have already cooperated with the Social Welfare Department to help carers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that carers who need help should not hesitate to phone the government's 182 183 hotline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The person answering the call doesn't only chat with you to calm you," Sun said at an event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are looking for temporary short-term care, the hotline will arrange it for you. If it's a very urgent situation, there will also be social workers rushing to help you."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday hinted there would soon be news on the administration's request for changes to visa arrangements for mainland residents visiting Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his latest Policy Address, Lee said he had asked Beijing to bring back multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen residents and to expand the number of cities that grant visas for weekly visits to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful that central government departments are studying the proposal to expedite the implementation. I believe there will be news soon," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All units of the SAR government will do their utmost to coordinate the implementation of such measures, promote people-to-people exchanges, and inject new momentum into the tourism, catering and retail industries."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beginning in April 2009, Shenzhen residents were allowed to apply for Individual Visit Endorsements, with holders able to enter and exit the SAR freely within a one-year validity period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the scheme was replaced with a "one-trip-per-week" arrangement in 2015 following concerns over parallel trading and overcrowding.

    Men feel less included in society, survey finds

<img alt="The Hong Kong Christian Service found that the city has an inclusion score of about 70 out of 100. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781206_1_20241128131553.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Men feel they are less included in society than women, according to a survey conducted by the Hong Kong Christian Service.
 <br>
  <br>
  The group surveyed 1,026 people between May and June to gather their views on eight attributes affecting their sense of inclusiveness. These areas are employment, recreational facilities, housing, family life, social connections, education, healthcare and culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The overall inclusion score was about 70 out of 100, which the group views as "average".
  <br>
  <br>
  But men scored lower than women in every aspect.
  <br>
  <br>
  A single father surnamed Wong said gender stereotypes have made parenting of his seven-year-old daughter difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have never seen any father help with changing a baby's diaper in the shopping mall’s baby care room. To avoid embarrassment, I would knock on the door to 'seek approval' from the mothers inside," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he sometimes feels he is treated unkindly, saying he has overheard people talk about whether he might be a kidnapper when he holds his daughter's hand when they are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson Yung from the Hong Kong Christian Service called on society to be more accepting and to appreciate men's decisions over their family roles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We analysed that maybe due to Chinese culture, which mainly sees a man taking the role of family income [earners], and childcare will rely on women. In the current situation the society is not too accepting for men to be child caregivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that interviewees considered education to be the least inclusive area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said while the government has recently invested a lot resources in special needs students, there's a need for more tailored support, stressing that the current approach is too generic.

<img alt="Paul Chan says Hong Kong can connect mainland China and the Global South with the markets worldwide. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781207_1_20241128132121.jpg&q=1">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday called on business leaders to help with Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's largest free trade agreement.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce International Business Summit, Lee said with growing partnership between Hong Kong and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), it's clear that the SAR is ready to join RCEP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the next natural step in our growing ties with Asean is for Hong Kong to become a member of RCEP," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  RCEP is a free trade pact for the Asian-Pacific region that includes all 10 Asean member states.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is fully prepared to join RCEP. Doing so will boost our ties in trade and benefit companies and investors throughout the nations of Asean and also RCEP," the CE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I continue to count on business leaders like your good selves, people who know Hong Kong well and appreciate the value that Hong Kong can add to RCEP, to speak up in support of our accession bid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who also attended the summit, said Hong Kong has a unique role in connecting the markets in the Global South, including mainland China, to the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that many mainland companies have established supply chains in the Global South and Belt and Road countries, and Hong Kong can play the role of a super-connector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Mainland firms] need project and trade financing. They need world-class professional services. They need global capital and global talent. In order to do this, Hong Kong would be a very unique platform,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are encouraging mainland companies coming to Hong Kong to set up their regional offices, even international offices, to support their global ambition.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also spoke about challenges facing the world "underscored by geo-economic fragmentation", such as threats by US President-elect Donald Trump to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that, Chan said the US and Europe remain important and valuable partners for the SAR and China as a whole, saying cooperation remains possible in "non-sensitive areas" such as infrastructure and climate-related activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the SAR needs to engage proactively with the West and reach out to their markets to tell the true Hong Kong story, to tackle misconceptions and biases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard Chartered's President, International, Benjamin Hung, said business people he'd spoken to around the world were discussing the possibility of higher US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said with China having the world's largest production capacity, firms shifting their manufacturing elsewhere may lead to rising costs and higher inflation, adding to consumers' burden.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, diversification is the name of the game... This is like insurance, this is like buying protection, because nowhere in the world, unfortunately, can produce the quantity, the quality, and at the cost level that China can," Hung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So 'China+1' is never going to be enough because 'China+1' isn't enough to compensate the volume of China. You need 'China+2', 'China+N'."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong’s role amidst the challenges isn't just to be a centre for supply chains, but also to manage capital.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House said three Americans jailed in China have been released and were heading back to the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trio – Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung – had been considered by Washington to be wrongfully detained by Beijing. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to all three. "I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they'll soon be reunited with their loved ones," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Politico, which first reported the release, said a number of Chinese citizens detained in the US would also be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's embassy in Washington did not comment on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US has upgraded its travel advisory for China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department changed its travel warning to China to level 2, advising US citizens to “exercise increased caution” when travelling to the country. It had previously been at level 3, telling Americans to “reconsider travel”. (Agencies)

    Ocean Park sees deficit despite visitor, income surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leaders the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered their first home loss of the season with a surprise 135-124 defeat to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's second loss of the season came afer a strong second half display from Atlanta with De'Andre Hunter scoring 26 points off the bench, Jalen Johnson adding 22 points and Trae Young contributing 20 with a career-high 22 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young put the game beyond the Cavs with a 39-foot three pointer to make it 129-122 with just under two minutes remaining, moments after he had turned the ball over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson said Young's assists had been crucial to the victory, and that he deserved more credit for his role on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really getting off the ball and finding everyone," Johnson said. "A lot of people don't necessarily talk about him, even though he's leading the league in assists – but they don't talk about him as the playmaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win moves the Hawks to 8-11 on the season, and Young said the team had shown what they were capable of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a really good team who have been playing well all year, and I feel we have been a little inconsistent but the times that we have played well, we've played really well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 30 for Cleveland and Evan Mobley put up 22 points and 13 rebounds, but the Cavs missed out on a chance to become the first team to start with an 18-1 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets needed overtime to beat the 3-14 Philadelphia 76ers, with Alperen Şengün scoring 22 points and claiming 14 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of Sengun's points came in overtime, where the Rockets made sure of moving to 14-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, James Harden scored 43 points for the Los Angeles Clippers as they beat the struggling Washington Wizards 121-96.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden scored 23 of his points in the first quarter, and left the game late in the third quarter with the Wizards already condemned to their 13th straight defeat. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday warned that technology-related crimes are on the rise in Hong Kong, while vowing to work with other jurisdictions to take on the challenges new technology poses.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR attaches great importance to ensuring the security of cyber infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, a highly developed international financial centre where technology is easily accessible by all, criminals are increasingly turning to the use of cryptocurrencies, virtual assets and technology in committing traditional crime. And crimes executed solely through technology are also on the rise," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why Hong Kong places great emphasis on the security of cyber infrastructure, in fighting technology crime, locally and internationally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the same conference that crimes involving modern technology present "novel challenges" to prosecutors, adding that it can be difficult to bring offenders to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Modern technology is, of course, not inherently evil. It becomes evil only when it is misused and abused by criminals," Lam said. "Our overriding objective is not only to prevent, suppress and punish such misuses and abuses, but also to outwit the criminals by becoming better users of modern technology and make modern technology our close ally in our war against the criminals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tong Jianming, first deputy prosecutor general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said it is important for jurisdictions to adapt to changes brought about by technological developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Beijing is willing to collaborate with others on using modern technology in strengthening prosecutions and looking into effective ways to tackle crime.

    Analyst sees slight growth in home prices in 2025

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Barcelona and Uruguay striker Luis Suárez has signed a one-year contract extension with the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and will line up under new coach Javier Mascherano next season, the team said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old striker has scored 25 goals in all competitions since joining the club before the start of this season including 20 in Miami's record-breaking regular season campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After winning the Supporters' Shield for the best record in the regular season, with a new points tally record, Miami were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then Argentina head coach Gerardo Martino has left the club with his compatriot and Suárez's former team-mate at Barca, Mascherano appointed on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy, very excited to continue for another year and to be able to enjoy being here with this fan base, which for us is like family," said Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel very, very connected with Suárez, and hopefully, next year, we can bring them even more joy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's president of football operations Raul Sanllehi said Suárez had shown he remains an elite level forward, but was also a key component in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luis was not only our leading scorer this season, but also a leader for the group. His impact cannot be understated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suárez announced in September he was retiring from international duty with the Uruguay national team after scoring 69 goals in 143 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward played in Europe for Ajax, Liverpool and Atlético Madrid and had a season in Brazil with Gremio before joining Miami. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly set to be appointed as Leicester City's new manager, various British media outlets said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy recently left Manchester United after a short spell as interim manager and serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on Sunday after just 12 Premier League games in charge, with the Foxes 16th in the table and only one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Van Nistelrooy's three wins in four games as United's caretaker boss in the past month came against Leicester in the League Cup and Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old Dutchman has previous managerial experience from one year in charge of PSV Eindhoven from 2022 to 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky Sports reported that he could even be appointed in time to lead Leicester in their next game away at Brentford on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a glorious playing career, most notably at PSV, Man United and Real Madrid. (AFP)

    Kumara gives Sri Lanka edge against South Africa

<img alt="Sri Lanka players celebrate after the dismissal of South Africa's David Bedingham. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781156_1_20241128070753.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lahiru Kumara struck twice as Sri Lanka's bowlers had the better of a rain-hit opening day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were 80 for four when rain stopped play for the day shortly before lunch. Fast bowler Kumara took wickets in successive overs to put his team on top – and was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot in favour of the bowling team and they bowled well. The deliveries that got wickets were all pretty decent," said South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a skilled bowling line-up and obviously they have done their homework," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan bowling coach Darshana Gamage said pace was Kumara's biggest asset. With a history of hamstring injuries, he is now being used as a Test specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this Test championship, we wanted to have all our bowlers fresh," said Gamage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our biggest challenge is to have quicks who will win us Test matches and I can say that we have the nucleus now to do the job away from home," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka's decision to bowl first on a well-grassed pitch paid off under a heavily overcast sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Namesakes Ajitha and Vishwa Fernando dismissed both South Africa's openers with the total on 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tristan Stubbs and South African captain Temba Bavuma defended doggedly, taking the total to 29 after 13 overs.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a flurry of scoring when Kumara came into the attack in the 14th over, with 17 runs added off his first over – four leg-byes, a no-ball and three boundaries by Stubbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the strongly-built Kumara found extra bounce with the first ball of his second over, having Stubbs caught at third slip for 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather is expected to clear from Thursday and Prince said South Africa were in a reasonable position, referring to the first Test between Australia and India in Perth last weekend when two low first innings totals were followed by a strong Indian second-innings performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-Test series is crucial to both sides' hopes of reaching next year's World Test Championship final at Lord's, with Sri Lanka sitting third in the table and South Africa fifth. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé saw a penalty saved as Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday to inflict a third Uefa Champions League defeat in five matches on the holders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored the goals in the second half as the Reds maintained their perfect record to return to the top of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah also fired wide from the spot, but it mattered little as Liverpool secured a 17th win in Arne Slot's first 19 games in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has already achieved what Jurgen Klopp could not as Liverpool boss by slaying the Spanish giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had a score to settle with Madrid, who were unbeaten in eight previous meetings between the sides, including Champions League finals against Klopp's men in 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat sends Carlo Ancelotti's side tumbling down to 24th in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the first minute they just took control of the game," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham, in what was a disappointing return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think they were more up for it than us, to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. It's a bad result against probably the best-performing team in Europe," he added. "It's no disgrace to come here and lose, but we are disappointed in how we performed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top 24 progress to the knockout stage with the top eight advancing directly to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are well on course to do just that and the confidence coursing through a side also eight points clear at the top of the Premier League was in evidence throughout in front of a highly-charged Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hamstrung by a lengthy injury list and made the trip to England without Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young centre-back Raul Asencio has been pressed into action by those absences and he made a vital goal-line clearance on four minutes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several members of Donald Trump's incoming administration have received threats including bomb alerts, the FBI said on Wednesday, with one nominee reporting a pipe-bomb scare sent with a pro-Palestinian message.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The FBI is aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees, and we are working with our law enforcement partners," the agency said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swatting refers to the practice in which police are summoned urgently to someone's house under false pretenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, earlier said that several appointees and nominees “were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elise Stefanik, a Trump loyalist congresswoman tapped to be UN ambassador, said her residence in New York was targeted in a bomb threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in a statement that she, her husband, and her three-year-old son were driving home from Washington for the Thanksgiving holiday when they learned of the threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Zeldin, Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said his home was targeted with a pipe bomb threat sent with “a pro-Palestinian themed message.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The former congressman from New York said he and his family were not home at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he prepares to return to the White House in January, Trump has already swiftly assembled a cabinet of loyalists, including several criticised for a severe lack of experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican, who appears set to avoid trial on criminal prosecutions related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss, was wounded in the ear in July in an assassination attempt.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan police said on Wednesday they had arrested nearly 1,000 protesters who marched on the capital Islamabad demanding the release of jailed ex-prime minister Imran Khan, after crowds were evicted from the city centre in a sweeping security crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khan has been jailed since August 2023, sidelined by dozens of legal cases he claims were concocted to prevent his comeback in elections this year marred by rigging allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the February vote, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has defied a government crackdown with regular rallies, but Tuesday's gathering was by far the largest to grip the capital since the poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 protesters surged into the city, defying a lockdown and a ban on public gatherings to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad Police Inspector General Ali Nasir Rizvi said 954 protesters had been arrested between Sunday and Tuesday, when crowds came within 1.6 kilometres of a public square they aimed to occupy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said at least one police officer and four state paramilitary personnel had been killed, before the main thoroughfare was cleared by forces armed with tear gas and batons early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that security forces had "bravely repulsed the protesters" as PTI told activists on social media the rally was cancelled "for the time being."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khan made a statement from his cell outside Islamabad calling supporters to the capital on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the crowds were led by his key lieutenant Ali Amin Gandapur and his wife Bushra Bibi, who was also jailed earlier this year but released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement is continuing and it will be ended only by Imran Khan," said Gandapur after retreating from Islamabad to northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where he serves as chief minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called the protests "extremism." Since Sunday, his ministers have held regular press conferences in central Islamabad vowing no mercy for the oncoming marchers. (AFP)

<img alt="Despite Wednesday's lacklustre session, investors are optimistic about the month ahead. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781148_1_20241128054143.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday, retreating from records after pricing data showed an uptick in inflation, as leading companies fell after earnings reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  After three straight closing records for the Dow and Tuesday's record for the S&P 500, both dropped along with the Nasdaq in the final full trading session of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.3 percent at 44,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 5,998, while the Nasdaq shed 0.6 percent to 19,060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Wednesday's lacklustre session, investors are optimistic about the upcoming period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A note from CFRA Research pointed out that December has historically been the strongest month of the year for the S&P 500 since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We project additional new highs through year-end as the S&P approaches our 6,145 target level," CFRA said in the note. "However, the year ahead could offer additional challenges, which will likely lead to a below-average full-year gain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months to October, up from 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Futures markets currently place the odds at about two-thirds that the Fed will cut interest rates again in December by a quarter of a percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, both Dell Technologies and HP Inc. fell sharply on disappointment with their profit outlooks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dell slumped 12.3 percent and HP lost 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Department store Nordstrom also retreated, sinking 8.2 percent as it reported a 4.6 percent increase in revenues. But the company also reported lower profits in a move attributed to higher costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will be closed on Thursday and open for only a half-day on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Wednesday said a three-day visit to the Greater Bay Area has offered authorities insight into developing the Northern Metropolis project in the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Concluding the three-day visit to Guangdong province attended by government officials and business leaders, Chan said the trip had met its goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This trip to different major cities is purely an introduction, an exchange. We do not require business representatives to make any investments," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that they are able to see business opportunities, because they are truly the experts in doing business. When they see business opportunities, naturally, they will hold discussions [with others]."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the trip, enterprises from Guangdong and Hong Kong signed 126 economic and trade cooperation projects worth a total value of more than 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation also learnt about a “large-scale, land-disposable” development model used in mainland cities, which the SAR administration hopes can be used to expedite development in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will hold a "promotional event" relating to the mega project on Friday, with local, mainland and foreign companies expected to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance chief Paul Chan is hammering out the details and will make an announcement in due course, the chief secretary added.

<img alt="Hassan Fadlallah (centre) said there was full cooperation with the Lebanese state. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781121_1_20241127211249.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah lawmaker Hassan Fadlallah said on Wednesday his group was cooperating with the army's deployment to southern Lebanon under the terms of a new truce with Israel, insisting "there will be no problem there".
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as Lebanon's army said it had begun reinforcing its presence in the south, and as tens of thousands of residents streamed home after the sealing of an Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire following more than a year of hostilities and two months of all-out war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to an AFP question about Hezbollah fighters' withdrawal north of the Litani River in accordance with the ceasefire deal, Fadlallah said the matter was "linked to Lebanese state measures and strengthening the army presence".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is full cooperation on this issue and there will be no problem there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lebanese military said Wednesday that it had "begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state's authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)".
  <br>
  <br>
  An AFP journalist saw army troops and vehicles in two areas of south Lebanon on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fadlallah went on to say that Hezbollah had "no visible weapons or bases" in the south, but at the same time, noted the group "is a secret resistance... not a regular army".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hezbollah's people are the people of these villages and towns, and most of the dead are from these villages," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nobody can make residents leave their villages."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since exchanges of cross-border fire began in October 2023, most of them in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the army would shore up its presence in the country's south, while urging Israel to withdraw and respect the ceasefire that came into force on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Banker Peter Wong will chair the university's governing council from January 1, 2025 for a three-year term. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781107_1_20241127183907.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Banker Peter Wong has been named the new chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) governing council, succeeding barrister Priscilla Wong after her term ends next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government on Wednesday announced the appointment of the banker, who was previously the Asia-Pacific chief executive officer at HSBC, for a term of three years with effect from January 1, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, in his capacity as the university's chancellor, also appointed five new members to the governing council.
  <br>
  <br>
  They include former director general of civil aviation Simon Li; Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Irons Sze; lawmaker Rock Chen; former president of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management Wilfred Wong; and CPPCC delegate Samuel Yung.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five other current members will also leave the governing council, alongside the outgoing chairwoman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The newly appointed members are all elites in the community, possessing outstanding capabilities and rich experience," the government said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chief executive hopes that the new appointments will provide the HKU's governance with a new outlook and new impetus, begin a new chapter in governance, steer the HKU towards striving for excellence and provide fresh momentum to the university."
  <br>
  <br>
  The university, for its part, said it respects the appointments made by the administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The university will continue to pursue excellence and make contributions in academic excellence, talent cultivation and international cooperation," HKU said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In June, a task force was established amid a conflict among the university's leadership, with vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang complaining that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the government statement, the chief executive thanked the task force “for its unremitting efforts in coordinating the HKU's internal operations, enhancing communication, assisting in resolving issues, reaching a consensus, and achieving a positive outcome”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The group will continue its work to facilitate collaboration between the new council and the management for the continuous enhancement of the HKU's governance effectiveness."

    Auditor finds hitches with care home voucher scheme

<img alt="The auditor said welfare officials need to resolve some administrative issues with the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781061_1_20241127153405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission said on Wednesday that it has found a number of administrative issues with a government voucher scheme for elderly people to pay for care homes, such as incorrect charges and widely varying application processing times.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a report, the commission said more than 5,700 applications for the Residential Care
  <br>
  Service Voucher scheme were received in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and as of the end of March this year, 3,179 vouchers had been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welfare officials haven't given a timeline on how long applications should take, but the auditor found it can vary greatly, from issuance the same day all the way to a wait of seven months. The average time was 43 days, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The auditor also found that some voucher recipients were wrongly sent bills for charges that were supposed to be covered by the government, or were overcharged by homes for extra items like nutritional drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department is tasked with inspecting service providers, as well as carrying out visits to check various aspects of the voucher scheme, such as the fees being charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the auditor found that in the previous three financial years, inspections were carried out 41 days late on average, while visits were 232 days overdue. The department blamed the delays on the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The social welfare director should] take measures to ensure that service monitoring visits and inspections are conducted in accordance with the timeframes stipulated in the department's guidelines," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also made a series of other recommendations, such a specific timeframe for processing voucher applications and a mechanism for vetting care home charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said it agreed with the recommendations and will take the necessary follow-up action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people who were jailed for conspiracy to commit subversion in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date have appealed against their convictions and sentences.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow, former lawmaker Helena Wong, former district councillor Clarisse Yeung and ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu filed their appeals to the High Court on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hearing date has not been scheduled, according to the judiciary website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the High Court handed down jail terms to 45 people for their roles in a scheme aiming to bring down the government by organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll, with sentences ranging from four years and two months to 10 years behind bars.

<img alt="The Audit Commission says it found numerous cases of " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781056_1_20241127152110.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission has urged the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) to improve its verification procedures when registering drones, after finding multiple cases of "odd data" in the system.
 <br>
  <br>
  The commission said it looked at some of the more than 24,000 drone registrations recorded via the Electronic Portal for Small Unmanned Aircraft (eSUA) as of June this year, and found numerous discrepancies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rules on flying drones in Hong Kong, such as whether permission is needed from the authorities, vary depending – among other things – on the weight of the aircraft in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in some cases, the recorded weight of drones registered in the database did not match the standard weight for their model and appear to have ended up in the wrong category, the commission said in a report released on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that while drones should have a unique serial number, dozens in the database had duplicate numbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another issue flagged up in the report was eSUA account holders deleting their accounts without deregistering their drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If an eSUA account has been deleted, there may no longer be any responsible person for the valid SUA [Small Unmanned Aircraft] held under the deleted account," the commission warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also discovered that as of June 30, several thousand registrations were "under verification" – with more than 1,250 languishing under this status for more than two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission linked this to an earlier move by the authorities to streamline the registration process by scrapping a requirement for owners to provide a photograph of the registration label attached to their drone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While CAD has drawn up plans and taken measures to handle the SUA under verification by 30 November 2024, CAD needs to continue to closely monitor the handling of the SUA under verification and take measures to ensure that those cases will be properly followed through," the commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also found that as of the end of June, the CAD had dealt with 38 cases of suspected violations of the SUA Order under the Civil Aviation Ordinance, of which 13 involved tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These indicated that visitors might not be well aware of the requirements under the SUA Order. With a view to enhancing the awareness of visitors on the SUA Order, CAD needs to make sustained efforts in arranging publicity and education targeting visitors," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Victor Liu, said he generally agrees with the commission's recommendations.

    Police investigate cause of noise barrier fire

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday launched an investigation after a six-metre-tall noise barrier along a road in Tsuen Wan caught fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel were called to Cheung Pei Shan Road near Shek Wai Kok Estate when the force received multiple fire reports at about 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters took about half an hour to put out the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers believe the blaze began beneath a footbridge near Shek Kuk House of Shek Wai Kok Estate, before spreading to the barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief inspector Law Sai-to of the Tsuen Wan district crime unit said emergency personnel did not find any accelerant at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During our investigations, we noticed some security cameras had captured the incident. However, since the location of the incident was accessible to anyone and was frequented by residents, and due to limited distance of the security cameras, the real cause of the fire is still under investigation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force added that though a 40-metre stretch of the road was burnt, the noise barrier structure was not at risk of collapsing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted online showed the structure engulfed in flames. "Wow, it's burning through the top," one driver in a video remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another said: "There's no way we can drive through this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Highways Department said it aims to fully reopen the road by early Thursday.

    Help make HK a green finance hub, CE tells bankers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday told the banking sector to gear up and help realise the government's vision of turning Hong Kong into a regional green finance hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a luncheon session hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Lee pointed out that the government has issued HK$220 billion worth of green and sustainable bonds since May 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said a roadmap will soon be released to guide financial institutions in meeting international sustainable standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the coming weeks, we will launch a roadmap on the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards on Sustainability Disclosure. We aspire to make Hong Kong among the world's first jurisdictions to align local requirements with international sustainability reporting requirements," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the chief executive noted that the government is just as committed to supporting the financial sector in innovation and adopting new technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a new subsidy scheme launched earlier this year which gives a maximum grant of HK$150,000 for each approved fintech project.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The establishment in June of a dedicated proof-of-concept subsidy scheme for green fintech makes that clear. Among other things, it will provide early stage funding support for pre-commercialised green fintech projects,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Beyond its value in green and sustainable finance, fintech can help companies tap into new technology, including AI and blockchain, to boost efficiency and stay abreast of the competition.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea’s weather agency said the capital, Seoul, was blanketed on Wednesday by the heaviest November snowfall since records began over a century ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The snowstorm grounded hundreds of flights and disrupted commuter traffic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said 20 centimetres of snow fell in northern parts of Seoul and nearby areas, compared to the city's previous record of 12.4 centimetres on November 28, 1972.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm blanketed much of the country, with the country’s central, eastern and southwestern regions seeing about 10 to 23 centimetres of snow.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 220 flights were cancelled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul, while emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, signs, and other safety risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather agency said snowfall would continue in most parts of the country until Thursday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said they arrested five men and two women in a series of anti-drugs operations this month involving "space oil" and an anaesthetic called etomidate, which is illegal to posses unless prescribed by a doctor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said their operations led to the seizure of space oil capsules and etomidate powder with a total estimated market value of around HK$17 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The gaining popularity of space oil or etomidate, which is currently a part one poison abused by the young people, has aroused our enforcement attention," said acting assistant commissioner Wong Ho-yin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The success of our enforcement in November demonstrates the strong determination of Hong Kong Customs in detecting the crimes relating to illicit etomidate or space oil," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that etomidate can cause tremors, dizziness, hallucinations and even brain damage.

    HKU to ensure Hong Kong's doctor supply

 The head of the University of Hong Kong's medical faculty said on Wednesday that it is important to ensure that support for all medical schools will continue after the establishment of a third such institute in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government said earlier that a medical school will be set up in the Northern Metropolis. So far, three universities have submitted proposals to run it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lau Chak-sing said HKU will help ensure there are enough doctors to serve the people of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to do our very best in training the best doctors with diversification, so they will not just be good in looking after patients, but also have a good understanding of disease mechanism, medical and health research, and be able to contribute to research development in Hong Kong and beyond," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the university's plan to establish a new graduate-entry medical programme can help produce the right doctors for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been receiving students who have completed a first degree before joining us in studying medicine [as a second bachelor's degree]. We have some experience in these students, and these students are more mature, more empathetic, and we find this is a useful development within the medical faculty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lau said the faculty's new clinical trial centre in Hetao which opened last week will provide a one-stop platform for training medical talent in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the centre aims to increase the standards of clinical trials by coordinating different stakeholders' needs, including the two existing medical schools, and public and private hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The institute is a common platform to facilitate clinical trials development in Hong Kong, we hope to attract industry investment in Hong Kong, attract clinical trials to be performed and conducted in Hong Kong as well as the Greater Bay Area," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the centre will train as much talent as possible so the city's medical industry can continue to thrive.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is proposing that landlords who rent out poor quality subdivided flats face prison terms of up to three years and fines as high as HK$300,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans to regulate such cramped homes include a minimum flat size of 86 square feet, or eight square metres, with rooms having a minimum height of 2.3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Documents submitted to Legco on Wednesday set out proposals for further requirements, including fire detectors and fire-resistant walls, as well as a ban on toilets being placed on balconies or outer corridors of buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say as well as proper ventilation and lighting, each subdivided flat should have its own water and electrical meters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Housing Bureau says renting out a flat that isn't certified would also be illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers are due to discuss the plans on December 2, with a public consultation exercise beginning the following day and lasting until February 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bureau says it hopes the bill will be passed next year and that registration of subdivided flats can get underway in the final quarter.

    Aussie social media bill closer to becoming law

<img alt="Australian legislation banning social media for people under 16 is closer to reality after it passed through the country's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781021_1_20241127122816.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia on Wednesday moved closer to banning social media for children under 16 after the parliament's lower house passed the bill even as Alphabet's Google and Facebook-owner Meta pressed the government to delay the legislation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia's House of Representatives passed the bill 102 votes to 13 after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left Labor government secured bipartisan support for the ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate is expected to debate the bill later on Wednesday, with the government keen to ensure it is passed by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With widespread support of the bill, analysts said this all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese, trying to lift his approval ratings ahead of an election expected in May, has argued that excessive use of social media poses risks to the physical and mental health of children and is looking for support from parents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The planned law would force social media platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to A$49.5 million (US$32 million) for systemic breaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licences. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,” Tehan told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some youth advocates including Australia's human rights commission raised concerns the law would hurt children's rights to self-expression, but a YouGov survey released on Tuesday showed 77 percent of Australians backed the ban, up from 61 percent in an August survey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during the debate on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were criticisms the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would “make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,” Daniel told Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,” she added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took effect on Wednesday, after more than a year of fighting that has killed thousands of people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The truce, which began before dawn, should bring a halt to a war that has forced tens of thousands of people in Israel and hundreds of thousands more in Lebanon to flee their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the ceasefire agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire does not address the war in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's security cabinet approved the US-France-brokered agreement after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented it, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war has seen swathes of Lebanon pounded by air strikes and Israeli troops deployed across the border to battle Hezbollah militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  It began with Hezbollah launching cross-border strikes in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas following its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon says at least 3,823 people have been killed in the country since then -- most of them in the past several weeks, when Israel escalated its campaign against Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Israeli side, the hostilities with Hezbollah have killed at least 82 soldiers and 47 civilians, authorities say. (Agencies)

    Lawmaker labels new arts blueprint 'a breakthrough'

<img alt="Works by German artist Markus Lupertz on display at this year's Art Basel Hong Kong. Under the government's blueprint, the city will strive to become an East-meets-West cultural exchange hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of the government's Advisory Committee on Arts Development says a new blueprint for the sector is a big leap forward.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Johnny Ng told Hong Kong Today's Ben Tse that the development plan was very comprehensive and could build up the city as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchanges, as expressed in the National 14th Five-Year Plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government unveiled its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development on Tuesday, with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It spells out four key directions, including promoting Chinese culture, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng told RTHK that the overhaul of arts funding was a "big breakthrough" that would see greater support towards individual artists or smaller groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that some small and medium-sized artist groups will be funded by the ADC (Arts Development Council), while the nine largest major performing arts groups will be supported by ACAD (Advisory Committee on Arts Development). I think we can see that in between, there's some mobility we can enhance in order to support individuals, small artists to get funding," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, government subventions are given to nine major performing arts groups - including the Hong Kong Ballet, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chung Ying Theatre Company - and grants to small and medium arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng said that by striving to become an East-meets-West regional arts hub, tourism and other sectors in Hong Kong would also benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was hopeful that more film festivals, art auctions and art tech exhibitions could be hosted in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR on December 8, a day after a greeting ceremony at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee said the names of the giant pandas, which arrived here from Sichuan in September, will be unveiled by officials at the ceremony, following a naming competition organised by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he and his wife recently visited the pandas with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that the pair of giant pandas were energetic and lively," he wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The park told me that the pair have adapted to their new environment very quickly, and they're doing well."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair's addition raises to six the number of giant pandas currently in the SAR, after Ying Ying gave birth to a pair of cubs in August.

    Mainland papers dismiss Trump's tariff threat

<img alt="State media dismiss Trump's reasons for further tariffs as " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780992_1_20241127095502.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 State media shrugged off US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing him of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, said on Monday that he would impose "an additional 10 percent tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation, after Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is far-fetched," China Daily said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the US lies with the US itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in tariff wars. If the US continues to politicise economic and trade issues by weaponising tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday also pledged 25 percent tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had a "good" conversation with Trump immediately following the president-elect's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth," as well as "some of the challenges that we can work on together," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian leader has assembled a team of ministers to lobby US lawmakers and members of Trump's inner circle, a repeat of a charm offensive during his first term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested on Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues but said drugs were a US problem. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A former inmate has credited a local charity with helping him reintegrate into society and overcome many challenges in his life.
 <br>
  <br>
  John has now become one of the ambassadors of the Sports Change Life Foundation, which provides sports companionship and mentorship to inmates, rehabilitated individuals and those facing adversity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC) and has organised the project "Free Running Peer Exercise Reform Plan - Join Together to Save Calories for the Warmth Campaign".
  <br>
  <br>
  The idea is that the number of calories burnt during the exercise is exchanged for food and Christmas meals to be donated to the needy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before, I don't believe that I can keep running for 10 kilometres. But through this kind of practice, step by step, I can break through some obstacles and make me to build up my confidence and let me to believe that I can stand up again. It's very important to me to build a positive mindset to myself that helps me to reintegrate into the society," said John (not his real name).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fundraising director Chu Ki-sum said peer-running programmes were designed to train inmates and rehabilitated individuals as ambassadors, who eventually visit schools to share their experiences, inspire youth to steer clear of drugs and crime, promote healthy values, and prevent delinquency.
  <br>
  <br>
  John added that the funding would cover expenses for professional coaching, running equipment, resources, and school visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the training and also after the training we have some gathering so this gathering can build a friendship to support them and just like the guardians to help them to integrate into society," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in a Champions League thriller on Tuesday and extend their winless run to six games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions did snap a five-game losing streak, but did little to boost confidence ahead of Sunday's trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool by conceding three times in the final 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola admitted his star-studded squad were "fragile" and lacking in confidence after the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two goals from Erling Haaland, either side of Ilkay Gundogan's deflected effort, looked set to restore some order for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defensive frailties that have been the root cause for a staggering collapse in recent weeks was exposed in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko hit back to salvage a vital point for the Dutch giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We concede a lot of goals because we are not stable," said Guardiola. "We lost a lot of games lately – we are fragile, and of course we need a victory."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game [at 3-0] was good for the confidence, playing at a good level and the first time something happens we have problems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draw leaves City with plenty of work to do to reach the knockout stages with trips to Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain to come in their next two Champions League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top eight progress directly to the last 16 with a place in the top 24 of the 36-team table enough to reach the playoff round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig meanwhile remain on no points after a fifth defeat in as many games in the Champions League, with even qualification for the play-offs looking tricky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal extended their revival with a ruthless 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side ended a three-match winless run in all competitions by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard netted late on to give Arsenal five away goals in a Champions League game for the first time since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's third win in five Champions League matches this season lifted them into seventh place, with the top eight teams in the revamped tournament earning automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting's first defeat in Europe's elite club competition this season leaves them below Arsenal on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their dip, but this swaggering effort suggested they are finally back in the groove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta had challenged Arsenal to make a statement against Sporting and they responded in emphatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners' first away win in the Champions League in six attempts was a welcome tonic after a 1-0 loss at Inter Milan in their last European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's impressive performance was all the more notable as Sporting had crushed Manchester City 4-1 in their final Champions League game under Ruben Amorim, who has since taken charge of Manchester United. (AFP)

<img alt="Bayern Munich players celebrate after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780966_1_20241127071610.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A first-half header from Min-jae Kim guided Bayern Munich to a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, worsening the French side's hopes of progressing in the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre-back scored after an error from PSG goalkeeper Matvei Safonov, starting ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who spilled the ball into Kim's path.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean's effort was the only goal in the rematch of 2020's Champions League final, won by Bayern by the same scoreline, and all but extinguishes PSG's hopes of a top-eight finish and avoiding the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ousmane Dembele picked up a second yellow for an unnecessary challenge with half an hour remaining, with Bayern successfully shutting up shop as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just three games remaining, even making the knockouts is not a given for the French champions, who are in 26th spot – outside the playoff placings.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG host Manchester City in January along with facing tricky away trips to Red Bull Salzburg and Stuttgart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's top-eight hopes look rosier after the win, which extended their run of clean sheets to seven straight games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern now sit 11th and take on relative European minnows Shakhtar Donetsk, Feyenoord and Slovan Bratislava in their remaining games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides came into the game unbeaten and six points clear in their domestic leagues but in dire need of points in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern coach Vincent Kompany opted for the speed of Leroy Sane over the creativity of France winger Michael Olise up front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG boss Luis Enrique made five changes to his side but it was his decision to stick with goalkeeper Safonov, rather than Donnarumma, who had played all but one Champions League game this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enrique defended his call before the game, telling reporters "I make my choices based on what I see on the pitch and what's best for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision appeared to pay off early, with Safonov responsible for good saves from Jamal Musiala and Leroy Sane inside the opening 12 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kingsley Coman, the PSG academy product who scored the only goal in the 2020 final, almost broke the deadlock shortly afterwards, dribbling through five defenders and blasting just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After PSG had a few opportunities of their own, including Joao Neves' long-range effort whistling past the goalpost on 33 minutes, the Russian goalkeeper made a mistake which led directly to the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich swung in a corner on the 38-minute mark which Safonov spilled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim was on the spot to power an ascending header against Safonov's momentum and into the top left corner of the net, his first Champions League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern were happy to let the game come to them in the second-half but Dembele's second yellow – his first had come for dissent – took the steam out of PSG's hopes of a comeback. (AFP)

<img alt="The response to Donald Trump's threats of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China suggests the market views the warning as a bargaining chip. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780964_1_20241127065203.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered to fresh records on Tuesday, shrugging off a threat from President-elect Donald Trump to enact new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,860, its third straight closing record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 6,021, also a record, while the Nasdaq gained 0.6 percent to 19,174.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who doesn't take office until January 20, made his threat in social media posts on Monday night, announcing huge import tariffs against neighbours Canada and Mexico and also China, if they do not stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors view Trump's inclination towards trade protectionism as a headwind to economic growth and higher equity prices. But Tuesday's response suggests the market views the warning as a bargaining chip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In theory, higher tariffs should not be good news for stocks. But, you know, I think the market's chosen to think of (it) as a negotiating tactic," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have bullish sentiment," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "People are tending to look at things as positively as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other economic news, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 111.7 this month, up from 109.6 in October, boosted by greater optimism surrounding the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy tumbled 4.9 percent as it cut its full-year sales outlook after a big slowdown in sales leading into the presidential election. The electronics retailer said sales have rebounded since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other retailers also fell, including Burlington Stores, down 1.6 percent; Dick's Sporting Goods, down 1.4 percent; and Kohl's, down 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amgen dropped 4.8 percent after reporting that trials of its MariTide drug led to weight loss of up to 20 percent after 52 weeks. The drop in shares appeared to show disappointment that the impact was not even greater. (AFP)

    Russia vows response to latest Ukraine ATACMS strikes

<img alt="Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780941_1_20241126220654.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Moscow's military on Tuesday pledged a response to fresh Ukrainian air attacks inside Russia using US-supplied ATACMS missiles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine firing the long-range missiles into Russia for the first time last week prompted a furious reaction from Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry on Tuesday said Ukraine had carried out fresh strikes on November 23 and 25 using ATACMS.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Retaliatory actions are being prepared," it said in a post on Telegram, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States gave Ukraine permission to use the weapons to hit Russian territory earlier this month after months of requests from Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rare admission, Russia said the fresh strikes had caused damage to military hardware and wounded some of its personnel on the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the Kursk Vostochny air base wounded two servicemen, the defence ministry said, while a strike on an air defence battery damaged a radar system and also caused "casualties".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three of the five missiles fired in the first strike were shot down, while seven of the eight used in the second were destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow rarely provides such specific details on Ukrainian aerial attacks and almost never admits missiles have reached their intended target.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defence ministry also posted photos of what it said were the missile fragments, showing large casings with English-language inscriptions on the side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The images could not be immediately verified.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes come with tensions having ratcheted up dramatically in the near three-year conflict over the last few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin last week signed a decree lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, days before launching the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile at Ukraine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Tuesday strongly disapproved and opposed a letter from US politicians to the country’s treasury secretary, saying that it damages the SAR’s reputation as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  An SAR government spokesman stressed that the allegations had no factual basis and the letter was a “crude and reprehensible attempt to spread lies and misinformation about Hong Kong for personal political gain”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government “has been enforcing the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council fully and vigorously to fulfil our international obligations”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that maintaining the integrity and robustness of the city's financial systems is a top priority for the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been recognised by the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter on anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism, to be overall compliant with the relevant international standards, with a robust legal framework and effective system in this area, especially in the identification and understanding of risks, law enforcement, asset recovery and international co-operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter by US lawmakers alleged Hong Kong is playing an "increasing role as a financial hub for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and other illicit financial activities".

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTN South Africa has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China Telecom and Huawei for strategic collaboration that could advance the mobile operator's offerings in 5G, cloud, AI and business solutions, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership unites China Telecom's global expertise in network solutions with MTN's expansive regional reach and Huawei's advanced technology, creating a powerful alliance to drive digital infrastructure development on the continent," said Kai Chen, executive vice president of China Telecom Global .
  <br>
  <br>
  MTN South Africa, the country's second biggest mobile operator, said the partnership would unlock new business opportunities and offer South Africans enhanced technology, including the internet of things.
  <br>
  <br>
  The internet of things, or IoT, describes devices connecting to the internet that aren't primarily computers, such as fridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For MTN's business customers, network service improvements could offer new possibilities in smart mining and industrial applications," said Tumi Sekhukhune-Chamayou, chief enterprise business officer at MTN South Africa. (Reuters)

    Biden proposes weight loss drugs under Medicare

<img alt="Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese would qualify for coverage. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780923_1_20241126195823.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Ozempic covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed on Tuesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The costly proposal from the US Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labelled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as US$35 billion over the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. “It's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The rule would not be finalised until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese — someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher — would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese. (AP)

 Police on Tuesday said they arrested 59 people, after officers busted syndicates allegedly linked to loan shark and illegal debt collection activities involving a total of more than HK$39 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The force said the suspects, between the ages of 20 and 76, are alleged to have targeted foreign domestic helpers
  <br>
  <br>
  They said syndicate members used different methods to deduct the amount of money the borrower actually received, such as forcing them to purchase goods or pay administration fees. The victims then had to repay the loan at a high-interest rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The syndicate took advantage of lenders who have borrowing needs,” said Ho Yan-ki, the Chief Inspector of Hong Kong Island Regional Crime Unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers seized over HK$1 million in cash, passports, employment contracts and loan agreements during the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho encouraged foreign domestic helpers and their employers to contact police if they encountered such loan shark syndicates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's oldest man, Briton John Tinniswood, has died aged 112 at the care home where he lived in Southport, northwest England, Guinness World Records said on Tuesday, quoting his family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tinniswood was born in Liverpool on August 26, 1912, and died on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He became the world's oldest man in April following the death of 114-year-old Venezuelan Juan Vicente Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His last day was surrounded by music and love," the family said in a statement, also thanking "all those who cared for him over the years".
  <br>
  <br>
  Born the same year the Titanic sank and living through both World Wars, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records that the secret to his longevity was "pure luck".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You either live long or you live short, and you can't do much about it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He nonetheless advised moderation in all things to stay healthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you're going to suffer eventually," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During World War Two, Tinniswood held an administrative role in the Royal Army Pay Corps, going on to work in accounts for oil giants Shell and BP.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was a life-long supporter of Liverpool football club, and ate fish and chips every Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's oldest living woman currently is Japan's Tomiko Itooka, who is 116.

<img alt="Mathias Woo says he hopes more performance venues in the West Kowloon Cultural District can launch long-term partnerships with theatre groups. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780904_1_20241126180400.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A renowned theatre producer and curator on Tuesday welcomed the government's new roadmap on promoting arts and culture development in Hong Kong, saying it provides a comprehensive plan for the sector's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mathias Woo, co-Artistic director and executive director of Zuni Icosahedron, said the 71 measures in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development are very comprehensive, covering almost all aspects.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It covers venues, it covers exchange, it covers personnel training, facility, [role of West Kowloon Cultural District Authority]. Somehow I think it's a very, very good start,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woo said he hopes the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority can more proactively reach out to art groups and allow them long-term use of its performance venues.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The blueprint mentioned that the authority should pick up a stronger role in facilitating culture and creative industry. I think it has to strengthen its connection with the industry and also to build a more content-based venue, which means, like in London, you have the Royal Ballet, the art groups have their own venue and their own home base,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam Kwok-kan, a member of the Arts Development Council, also welcomed the news, especially the idea of industrialising the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The industrialisation of art and culture makes it something that can involve people, involve talents, involve artists, not just in their own production, in their own creativity, but also make their work marketable,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who’s also the dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science at Hang Seng University, said he believes this focus can help showcase the work of arts groups to the outside world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Many of the art groups in Hong Kong do not know how to market their products. So this blueprint has a focus on marketisation, not just let the different art groups to work alone, but to create synergies among them, and to build a platform for them to market their work, not just in Hong Kong, not just in China, but also in places outside Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam added that he thinks the government should accord priority to developing the theatre and film industries, saying theatre performances and movies are good ways to attract tourists and showcase Hong Kong.

    Andrey Rublev hopes to swing another victory in HK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis sensation Andrey Rublev says he is looking forward to playing in Hong Kong again, emphasising that having a strong mindset sets the stage for his entire tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World No. 8 player is eager to defend his title at the Hong Kong Tennis Open 2025, which will take place from December 29 to January 5 at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev said he is excited for the event, adding that the unwavering support of the SAR fans and the welcoming environment boosted his comfort and motivation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great the atmosphere there last year. There was a lot of people who came from [the mainland] to watch me play and it was nice. It's a bit different compared to Europe audience because in general in Asia, they like to draw some posters," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They like to draw. Some put something on the face or to wear the flags or to wear some T-shirts with some signs. Last year, I remember there was a lot of people that had a flag with my photo and it was nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev exited the 2024 ATP Finals more than a week ago without securing a victory, having been defeated in his last match against Casper Ruud, but he said he is actively enhancing his physical abilities to boost his speed for the upcoming tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he opts to refrain from setting rigid goals to prevent burnout, and instead focuses on enjoying the sport he loves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working much more in a bit in a different direction and I start to feel that I'm doing this better, so I just want to keep doing that, to play better at the net because, especially now, there is many matches that somehow can be one or two points different and this one or two points different [is] because I didn't play well at the net and then the other guy, when he went to the net and I tried to pass him he played really well and that was the difference in the most important time and the most important moment of the match," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things like that with the serve with the changing a bit of the rhythm, I start to hit better because I start to feel that I'm doing it better. We'll see just to keep doing them because in the end, it's not about preseason. It's a bit like a daily routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to do it a bit every day. It doesn't matter if you're in a tournament or not. That's it. It's something that we were doing the last couple of months and it's just now preseason and we have even more time to do it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan announced on Tuesday that he has launched an investigation into construction waste recycling services provided by the government, as well as its work in combating illegal dumping.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government implemented the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme almost two decades ago and also rolled out a pilot scheme in 2021 for people to make reservations for recycling construction waste through the app "HoHoSkips".
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan noted that waste is still illegally disposed of in public places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This not only causes inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affects environmental hygiene and requires additional public resources for disposal," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said data suggests the app might be underused.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, I have decided to launch this direct investigation operation to scrutinise the existing management of construction waste, including the EPD's control and preventive measures against illegal disposal of construction waste, specific details and operating situations of the 'HoHoSkips' service, how its effectiveness is monitored, and relevant promotion and publicity initiatives."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public have until December 27 to submit any views they have on the matter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government and the Housing Authority on Tuesday both said they respect the top court's ruling that grants subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Court of Final Appeal affirmed lower court rulings made earlier, saying that it also finds current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will study the judgment thoroughly and seek legal advice from the Department of Justice for appropriate follow-up actions," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Housing Authority spokesman also said it will study the judgment in detail and seek legal advice where necessary for taking follow-up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the litigants involved in the case, Nick Infinger, said he is happy he won the case after a six-year legal battle, saying this means same-sex couples have the right to live together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he hopes Hong Kong can become more equal and fair. "I feel quite excited because the court made the judgment in favour of us," he said outside court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the most important thing is not only fighting for me and for my partner, but this is fighting for all the same-sex couples in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Holden Chow expressed concern over the verdict, saying it might affect public housing resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would foresee following the verdict today there might be a lot of same-sex couples
  <br>
  getting married abroad and then they come back to Hong Kong and apply for public housing."
  <br>
  <br>
  So the question now is what is the impact on the public housing resources to be allocated to traditional families? These are the concerns shared by the general public," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has vowed to leverage Hong Kong's strengths to make the SAR an international cultural exchange centre, as it unveiled a development plan with dozens of measures for the city's creative industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development spells out four key directions -- promoting Chinese culture, developing diverse creative industries, building an international platform for cultural exchanges, and refining the ecosystem for creative industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes 71 measures covering industries such as film, music, and performing arts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around half of the initiatives have commenced, with the remaining beginning from next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal, the administration said, is to turn Hong Kong into an "East-meets-West" centre for international cultural exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Tuesday said the blueprint is a "macro policy document" that is not "cast in stone".
  <br>
  <br>
  "One unique aspect of art and creative industries is that they evolve over time with social development. The specific measures won't remain unchanged," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll keep an open mind when discussing with industry stakeholders. We'll review priorities for individual development paths and measures, explore new ideas aligned with the blueprint's vision and principles, and provide support with our resources."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities hope the economic benefit generated by creative industries will go from HK$122 billion in 2022 to HK$200 billion by 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal is for the number of jobs generated by such sectors to rise from more than 220,000, to 264,000 over the same period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include establishing a museum in the Northern Metropolis on the nation's development and achievements; displaying works of local artists and designers in government offices and buildings as a bid to make Hong Kong the "capital of creativity"; and promoting the city's unique pop culture on the mainland and around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  On enhancing the ecosystem, the blueprint mentions a comprehensive review of the current funding mechanism for arts groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said groups could be added to, or removed from, the subsidised list, although not based on one individual factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over time, we aim to maintain a balance in our different funding systems by considering various factors, and we plan to keep this approach in the future," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look at things like the individual art level, audience response, the impact on promoting sector growth, and whether the ideas are innovative. All these factors could serve as criteria when we update the funding mechanism."
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint puts an emphasis on participation from the whole of society and it shouldn't only be the government that pours in resources for arts and culture, the minister added.

    CFA affirms housing rights of same-sex couples

<img alt="The five-judge panel of the top court unanimously rejects the appeal from the Housing Authority. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780848_1_20241126121312.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has affirmed earlier court rulings granting subsidised housing benefits to same-sex couples, after finding current policies discriminatory and unconstitutional.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-judge panel of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, unanimously rejected an appeal from the Housing Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lower courts had granted the rights to subsidised housing benefits to two same-sex couples married overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA on Tuesday rejected the Housing Authority's argument that under the Basic Law, only opposite-sex married couples are entitled to apply for public housing, overriding provisions on equality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges held that while only opposite-sex couples can obtain the legal status of marriage under Hong Kong's constitutional framework, this doesn't shield housing policies from scrutiny under equality provisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entitlements to apply for [public rental housing] units and [Home Ownership Scheme] flats are only some of those [legal] rights, but they do not go to the status of marriage itself," the judgement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Basic Law article on marriage] therefore does not remove the subject Housing Authority policies from the purview of the equality provisions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing body had also argued that same-sex and heterosexual married couples weren't comparable because the latter can give birth, therefore supporting the government's policy objective on population growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges rejected this argument, saying same-sex couples can adopt children or have children through artificial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said they found the authority's policies aimed at supporting traditional family to be "disproportionate and unjustified", saying it didn't offer enough evidence over their arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said the authority did not address the likely effect on housing supply or the impact on opposite-sex couples if the policies were relaxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA dismissed the authority's appeal and ordered it to pay for the legal costs of the respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court also ruled against the government in a related case regarding the inheritance of property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Ng, now deceased, had wished to add his same-sex spouse as a registered occupant and joint owner to a Home Ownership Scheme flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary for justice had argued that foreign same-sex marriages aren't comparable to heterosexual marriages when it comes to inheritance rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CFA judges ruled that excluding same-sex spouses from inheritance amounted to unlawful discrimination.

    Service sector staff more stressed since pandemic: HKU

<img alt="Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say stress issues of employees in the service industry must be addressed. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780854_1_20241126140259.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 University of Hong Kong (HKU) researchers on Tuesday said stress levels of employees in the service industry must be dealt with for the SAR to further promote the hospitality sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKU's business school, together with the Hong Kong Association for Customer Service Excellence (HKACE), conducted three rounds of studies during and after Covid, involving about 1,000 employees in the service industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they found that employees are now more stressed out, with almost 45 percent reporting they frequently experienced burnout in the post-pandemic period, up from 15 percent during the Covid crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bennett Yim, a marketing professor with the school, described the survey findings as "shocking", adding that people had had high hopes for society to rebound after Covid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Businesses have not improved substantially. A lot of the organisations and companies on one hand want to rebuild their business, and at the same time, customers also have high expectations in the post-Covid period," Yim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When the two things come together, they're putting a lot of pressure on employees who are providing services to customers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yim said the stress issues of employees, especially frontline workers, must be addressed for the city to further promote the hospitality sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more tourists returning to Hong Kong. At the same time, we see a manpower shortage, particularly in the service industry. Because of that, it adds more stress to the employees which certainly affects the service provided to tourists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKACE honorary advisor Buston Chu said employers should provide workers with flexible arrangements, and also enhance their engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your employees involved. Let them know their purpose and that they are a very important stakeholder to make Hong Kong a place of hospitality. I think this is something the management have to do," Chu said.

<img alt="Maura Wong urged senior citizens to prioritise their well-being, cautioning that a significant temperature decrease could greatly affect their health.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Senior Citizen Home Safety Association on Tuesday said it has been proactively informing and advising elderly people about an impending cold spell, and has bolstered manpower to support those requiring assistance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, the group's head, Maura Wong, said there has not been a notable uptick in requests for assistance from the elderly lately, adding that a surge in help requests typically occurs approximately three days after a sharp temperature decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong urged senior citizens to prioritise their well-being, cautioning that a significant temperature decrease could greatly affect their health.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally, when the temperature drops, we notice several things. The elderly may complain of intensified pain, their blood circulation may not be that good, or they don't exercise or they find they lose their balance and fall, or suffer from dizziness," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In more serious cases, they may experience problems with their trachea."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Cheng Yuen-chung, an assistant director at the observatory, said on the same programme that temperatures could dip as low as 16 degrees on Wednesday and 15 degrees on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said temperatures in southern China are still within the normal range despite the impact of global warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our preliminary forecast is that the number of cold days this winter will be close to normal. What is considered normal? Generally speaking, the normal range of cold weather days in Hong Kong is 9 to 17 days. Last year, there were 14 cold days, which is within the normal range," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, DP World Tour Championship winner Rory McIlroy, and two-time major winner Xander Schuaffele were named Monday as 2024 PGA Tour Player of the Year award nominees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jack Nicklaus Award, named for the record 18-time major winner, and the Arnold Palmer Award for the PGA Rookie of the Year will be voted upon by PGA Tour members through December 4 with winners announced by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nominees for PGA Rookie of the Year include France's Matthieu Pavon and Americans Nick Dunlap, Jake Knapp and Max Greyserman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler and Schauffele are favorites in the top player race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler won Paris Olympic gold and captured seven titles on the PGA Tour, including his second Masters title in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old American also won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, the Heritage and Memorial tournaments, the Travelers Championship and the season-ending Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the season money leader and took the Byron Nelson Award for low scoring average at 68.645 strokes. He had 16 top-10 PGA finishes without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schauffele captured his first two major titles, winning the PGA Championship and the British Open, and the 31-year-old American was second in scoring average at 69.137. He had 15 top-10 efforts without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy won the Zurich Classic pairs event with Irishman Shane Lowry and his fourth Wells Fargo Championship on the PGA Tour and had 15 top-10s without a missed cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland almost captured his fifth major title and first since 2014 but settled for second at the US Open to Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the rookies, 20-year-old Dunlap was the surprise story. He won the American Express title as an amateur on a sponsor exemption in January, turned professional and then captured the Barracuda Championship, becoming the first player in tour history to win as a pro and amateur in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pavon, 32, won the Farmers Insurance Open and was third at Pebble Beach as well as fifth in the US Open. He was the only rookie to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knapp, 30, won his first PGA title at the Mexico Open while Greyserman, 29, was a three-time runner-up. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The innovation and technology chief on Tuesday expressed confidence in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics, saying these are “immensely promising”.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also told a summit on AI and robotics that such technologies not only enhance productivity and service quality, but also offer greater convenience and better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Coupled with the vast market size and population in the Greater Bay Area, the benefits of AI and robotics applications, alongside the associated business opportunities, are immensely promising and substantial,” Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR offers a “perfect setting” for the technologies to flourish, and that the city is moving towards becoming an international IT centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, organised by the Hong Kong Productivity Council, explores the trends and applications of AI and robotics.
