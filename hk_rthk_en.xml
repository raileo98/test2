<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are captivated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

 Three people were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered only minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were taken to hospital by ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third person was trapped in the rubbish truck, police said.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787420_2_20250114120033.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

 Hong Kong stocks opened higher on Tuesday, despite global markets mostly retreating after traders trimmed bets on US Federal Reserve rate cuts and oil extended a rally sparked by new sanctions on Russia's energy sector.

  The Hang Seng Index gained 27 points, or 0.15 percent, to open at 18,901.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off a weak opening and another uptick in Treasury bond yields amid shifting monetary policy expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices began the day in the same posture as Friday's session, when equities sold off after a strong jobs report was seen as dimming the odds for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,836, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent to 19,088, well above its session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market is less overbought compared with a few weeks ago after the sluggish beginning to 2025 equity trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is showing less sensitivity to higher bond yields," Haeling said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for about US$14.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intra-Cellular, which focuses on treatments for depression and schizophrenia, jumped 34.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moderna sank 16.8 percent as it projected 2025 revenues of between US$1.5 and US$2.5 billion, falling from the 2024 level of around US$3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail shares were mixed following financial updates that included inputs from the critical holiday shopping season. Macy's dropped 8.2 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 15.6 percent but Lululemon Athletica climbed 0.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes earnings from large banks, as well as economic releases on US inflation and retail sales. (AFP)

 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalized, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.

    'Marriage a goal for many same-sex couples in HK'

<img alt="A CUHK survey suggests many members of sexual minorities in the city hope to get married one day. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787324_1_20250113172035.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A survey carried out by Chinese University researchers suggests many same-sex couples in Hong Kong would like to get married one day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government last year said it was working on an alternative legal framework, after the city's top court ordered authorities to look at how to recognise same-sex relationships by October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CUHK researchers on Monday said a survey involving 908 people who identify as members of sexual minorities in Hong Kong in 2023 found 90 percent believe same-sex marriage is important, and around 70 percent would like to get married themselves one day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, so for married heterosexual couples, they already have an existing framework. So if they can pass on kind of the same pattern of laws, which they can call civil partnership, they can call it marriage, but then make it comparable to non-heterosexual couples, then that would be great," said Alan, who joined the researchers' press conference along with his partner Hong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple, who wed in the US in 2022, said the lack of legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong at the moment can pose challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, when my spouse gets sick, I would like to use my insurance package from work so that he can also be covered for medical visits. But I know in Hong Kong, not all insurance companies explicitly state that your spouse also includes same-sex couples," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also inheritance rights, that's also a significant hurdle for us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, CUHK said another survey involving 146 people with non-heterosexual children found more than half of the parents were worried their sons and daughters would not get married due to their sexual orientation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventy percent of the parents expressed fears that their children would have no one to take care of them when they are older.

    Four critically injured in scaffolding collapse

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eleven people on Monday were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak, with four in critical condition and one seriously hurt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emergency personnel received reports of the incident on Shing Cheong Road at around 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bamboo structure, measuring 60 by 20 metres, was said to give way at the site where the New Acute Hospital is being built.
  <br>
  <br>
  One worker was temporarily trapped five metres above ground after the collapse, according to firefighters, who said the rescue operation took about an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the seriousness of the incident, police said they are working with government departments to conduct in-depth investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would see whether anyone should bear criminal responsibility... The cause of the scaffolding collapse is one of the directions of our investigation," said senior Inspector Li Ka-wai of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project at the Kai Tak Development Area is set to be one of the largest hospitals in Hong Kong, with 2,400 beds, and 37 operating theatres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority (HA) expressed concerns over the incident and said the injured workers were hired by the contractor, China State Construction Engineering (Hong Kong) Limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The incident occurred at one of the buildings at the new acute hospital construction site, where curtain wall installation works were undergone," the authority said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All scaffolding work at the site will be temporarily suspended, and the HA reserves the right to hold the construction contractor accountable."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority has instructed the contractor to implement all necessary safety measures as soon as possible and requested it to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fay Siu from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims noted that a similar incident happened in Kai Tak almost a year ago, saying it showed that there are safety hazards when bamboo scaffolding is used.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government should review the safety of bamboo scaffolding, because they are not made from a very stable material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we are continuing to use bamboo scaffolding, there should be better inspections. The use of metal scaffolding should be encouraged too."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union has also strongly urged labour authorities to conduct an in-depth probe and make its report public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Labour Department must seriously learn from the hard lessons of past industrial accidents, quickly review regulatory and enforcement loopholes, swiftly address deficiencies, and effectively strengthen supervision and inspection work," it said.

    'Reducing sodium will not affect dim sum taste'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Food Safety of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department urged dim sum restaurants to reduce sodium content in their dishes after its survey revealed that a small decrease in salt would not affect its taste.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department conducted a test among 72 people to evaluate standard and reduced-sodium samples of two types of classic dim sum dishes, including shrimp siu mai and steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results showed that only 15 people were able to identify the altered shrimp siu mai, while only 13 spotted the modified steamed pork ribs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tony Chow, principal medical officer of risk assessment and communication at the Centre for Food Safety, said restaurants could consider choosing ingredients with lower sodium content or using natural ingredients for flavouring and marinating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We advise the [dim sum] trade to consider the reformulation of the dim sum so that the sodium content can be reduced because our study indicates that for the 10 to 20 percent reduction in sodium, the consumer will not differentiate the difference in the sodium content," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should not worry [that] the less salty food will be rejected by the consumer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow also said people should request that their dim sum be served separately from sauces when possible, and to taste before including additional flavouring.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also recommended that people share dim sum dishes when possible to avoid indulging, adding that the elderly should be more mindful of sodium levels when choosing their dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said the World Health Organisation recommends less than five grammes of salt intake daily, as excessive sodium intake could increase the risk of high blood pressure, and other diseases.

    Blue Origin pushes back launch of giant new rocket

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin will have to wait a little longer for the long-anticipated maiden orbital flight of its brand-new rocket after a launch attempt dragged on for hours before being canceled due to unspecified technical issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The towering 98-metre rocket, dubbed New Glenn in honor of legendary astronaut John Glenn, was scheduled to lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station during a three-hour window starting at 1am (0600 GMT) on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the countdown repeatedly stalled as teams scrambled to resolve anomalies, before the mission was officially "scrubbed" around 3.10am.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are standing down today's launch attempt to troubleshoot a vehicle subsystem issue that will take us beyond our launch window," said Ariane Cornell, a Blue Origin executive, during a livestream watched by hundreds of thousands of viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cornell added: "We are reviewing opportunities for our next launch attempt."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the mission, dubbed NG-1, billionaire Amazon founder Bezos is taking aim at the only man in the world wealthier than him: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its prolific Falcon 9 rockets, vital for the commercial sector, the Pentagon and Nasa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bezos, who celebrated his 61st birthday on Sunday, watched the events unfold from the nearby launch control room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, for his part, wished Blue Origin "Good luck!" on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town, and so having a competitor... this is great," G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior Nasa official, told AFP, expecting the competition to drive down costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship -- its gargantuan new-generation rocket -- this week, upping the high-stakes rivalry. (AFP)

 The mixer from a cement truck fell onto the road in Yau Ma Tei, although no injuries were reported.

  Police said the incident happened at about 3pm on Monday on Waterloo Road near Ferry Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a photo taken at the scene, the loading compartment was detached from the truck and lay across the road while the vehicle was stationary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have sealed off that section of road to traffic while they carry out their investigations.

<img alt="Officials inspect the instrument landing system localiser area at the site where a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 aircraft crashed on December 29.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Monday said they would change the concrete barriers used for navigation at airports around the country after the Jeju Air crash that left 179 people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the worst-ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improvement was deemed necessary including the localiser and its foundations for a total of nine facilities across seven airports, including Muan airport," the land ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes would also apply to international airports in the cities of Jeju and Gimhae.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attention has focused on several possible causes but questions have been raised about why the concrete barricade, known as a localiser and used to help planes navigate their landings, was at the end of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The barrier at Muan airport was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it would finalise plans to adapt the localisers by the end of January, with the aim of "completing upgrades within this year".
  <br>
  <br>
  The investigation was further clouded on Saturday when the transport ministry said the black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed flight stopped recording four minutes before the disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raided offices at Muan airport, a regional aviation office in the southwestern county, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul as the probe continues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The land ministry added that Muan airport's closure period had been extended until January 19. (AFP)

    HK can help companies diversify risk: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong can offer professional services to companies seeking to diversify risk by moving their businesses to different places.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Asian Financial Forum, the minister noted that many firms are realigning or restructuring their industrial and supply chains across different countries, particularly in the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong, as a supply chain management centre, has things to offer companies seeking diversification.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The [firms] would require project finance, corporate treasury and logistics services, professional consultancies and extensive international connections," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is well positioned and geared up to provide all these services as a one-stop shop to help businesses expand their presence in the region and beyond effectively."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR will navigate the global geopolitical and economic landscape with caution and confidence, saying opportunities come with every challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong can also offer technological solutions and sustainable development for the region, with its plans to develop an innovation and technology cooperation zone with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, also known as the Lok Ma Chau Loop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the SAR is looking to expand in areas such as artificial intelligence, biotech and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Loop, he said, is an example of Hong Kong forming synergy with sister cities in the Greater Bay area for IT development, such as speeding up the development of medicines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The zone] will be a base to pioneer with innovative policies and collaborations, such as joint clinical trials that leverage on data and bio-samples from both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed that these areas of development come on top of the SAR's traditional positioning as an international financial centre.

    Seoul says 300 NKorean soldiers killed in Ukraine

<img alt="A photograph shows an alleged North Korean soldier detained by Ukrainian authorities at an undisclosed location in Ukraine. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787299_1_20250113153440.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 wounded while fighting for Russia, a South Korean lawmaker said Monday, citing information from Seoul's spy agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seoul has previously claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent more than 10,000 soldiers to fight in the Ukraine conflict, in return for Russian technical assistance for Pyongyang's heavily sanctioned weapons and satellite programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, releasing video of the injured combatants being interrogated and raising the possibility of a prisoner swap for captured Ukrainian troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The deployment of North Korean troops to Russia has reportedly expanded to include the Kursk region, with estimates suggesting that casualties among North Korean forces have surpassed 3,000," lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters after a briefing from the spy agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes "approximately 300 deaths and 2,700 injuries," Lee said, after a briefing from Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
  <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers, reportedly from North Korea's elite Storm Corps, have been ordered to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner, Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Notably, memos found on deceased soldiers indicate that the North Korean authorities pressured them to commit suicide or self-detonate before capture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that some of the soldiers had been granted "amnesty" or wanted to join North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, hoping to improve their lot by fighting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIS analysis also revealed that the North Korean soldiers have "a lack of understanding of modern warfare," and are being used by Russia in a manner leading to "the high number of casualties," the lawmaker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee -- speaking for South Korea's intelligence committee in parliament -- said in the coming year, US president-elect Donald Trump, who has previously tried to woo North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, "may push for dialogue... once again".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Kim may "weigh the possibility of a visit to Russia in the first half of this year" after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Zelensky said: "Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong-un's soldiers to him if he can organise their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  There would "undoubtedly be more" North Korean soldiers captured by Kyiv, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available," said Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged that North Koreans have been deployed to fight. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism officials on Monday called on industry leaders to find ways to attract more overnight visitors to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year "golden week" holiday on the mainland, as they expect a significant rise in tourist numbers over the eight-day period.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rosanna Law, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, noted the upcoming holiday is a peak travel season and the SAR would be holding a series of festive activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect there to be a significant increase in tourists visiting Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year golden week," Law said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage the industry to seize this opportunity and be flexible to provide visitors with more high-quality and innovative experiences, attract them to stay overnight in Hong Kong to fully experience Hong Kong's unique festive atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who chaired a meeting with various government departments and representatives of the tourism and hotel sectors, also said relevant authorities would continue to maintain close communication and make preparations on welcoming visitors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

    400mil pilgrims gather for giant Hindu festival

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vast crowds of Hindu pilgrims in India began bathing in sacred waters on Monday as the Kumbh Mela festival opened, with organisers expecting 400 million people -- the largest gathering of humanity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The millennia-old Kumbh Mela, a show of religious piety and ritual bathing -- and a logistical challenge of staggering proportions -- is held at the site where the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the cool pre-dawn gloom, pilgrims surged forward to begin bathing in the waters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great joy," said Surmila Devi, 45.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it's like bathing in nectar."
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesswoman Reena Rai's voice quivered with excitement as she spoke about the "religious reasons" that brought her to join the sprawling tents, packed along the river banks in the north Indian city of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh state.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Hindu, this is an unmissable occasion," said the 38-year-old, who travelled around 1,000 kilometres from Madhya Pradesh state to take part in the festival, which runs from Monday until February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saffron-robed monks and naked ash-smeared ascetics roamed the crowds offering blessings to devotees, many of whom had walked for weeks to reach the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive congregation is also an occasion for India's Hindu nationalist government to burnish its credentials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a "divine occasion", that brings together "countless people in a sacred confluence of faith, devotion and culture".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu monk and Utter Pradesh's chief minister, welcomed devotees to "experience unity in diversity" at the "world's largest spiritual and cultural gathering".
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers say the scale of the Kumbh Mela is that of a temporary country -- with numbers expected to total around the combined populations of the United States and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some 350 to 400 million devotees are going to visit the mela, so you can imagine the scale of preparations," festival spokesman Vivek Chaturvedi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hindu monks carried huge flags of their respective sects, while tractors turned into chariots for life-size idols of Hindu gods rolled by behind them accompanied by elephants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pilgrims exulted in the beat of drums and honking horns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The festival is rooted in Hindu mythology, a battle between deities and demons for control of a pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organising authorities are calling it the great or "Maha" Kumbh Mela. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) Pan Gongsheng on Monday said Beijing will significantly increase the proportion of its national foreign exchange reserves and asset allocation in Hong Kong, as part of efforts to boost the development of the city's financial markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the 18th annual Asian Financial Forum in the SAR, Pan also said authorities will continue to deepen the financial market connectivity between Hong Kong and the mainland, to attract foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Prosperous capital markets are the cornerstone of Hong Kong as an international financial centre...We'll support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in the SAR, and continue to improve connectivity between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas like stocks, bonds, wealth management and interest rate swaps, to deepen financial cooperation within the Greater Bay Area," he told forum participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will significantly increase the proportion of our foreign exchange reserves and our asset allocation in Hong Kong to open up a broader space for Hong Kong's financial development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan said the PBOC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will introduce relevant policies to improve Hong Kong's offshore renminbi markets, while providing more convenience regarding cross-border payment and settlements.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the measures is the launch of an additional renminbi trade financing liquidity fund, with terms of one month, three months and six months, totalling 100 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zhou Ji, executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), said the central government will continue to support the SAR in consolidating its status as a global financial hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, the central government will, as always, do its utmost to support the consolidation of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, trade centre and shipping centre, and will support the SAR in accelerating the pace of developing scientific and technological innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On another note, Zhou said Beijing will continue to create new advantages by developing new quality productive forces to help with regional growth, stressing that the Chinese economy remains resilient with stable fundamentals.

    China's foreign trade hits new high in 2024

<img alt="Chinese exports surged to record highs in 2024 as the prospect of a testing second Trump administration looms. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787274_1_20250113125415.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    'High hopes for the SAR's task force in Thailand'

<img alt="Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was confident the SAR task force in Thailand would deliver results. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787266_1_20250113115736.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former security minister Lai Tung-kwok said he was optimistic about the prospects of the SAR's task force in Thailand, which is investigating allegations that Hongkongers have been lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal types of work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force, led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk, with members from Security Bureau and the Immigration Department, flew to Thailand on Sunday, after receiving 28 requests for assistance connected to Hong Kong residents who were allegedly held in the region against their will.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, 16 people have managed to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven men and five women reported restrictions on their movement, but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force. It is thought they were not forcibly abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a RTHK programme on Monday, Lai said the SAR government was highly concerned which is why it sent the task force led by Cheuk.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had high hopes for the task force's prospects given it has been liaising with Thai authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also believed the Thai police would also pay high attention to such incidents, considering the potential impact on tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Thai police also attach importance to this issue because it seriously affects the country's tourist industry. There have been media reports that many mainland tourists have cancelled trips to Thailand over the upcoming Lunar New Year - so I think Thailand wants to handle any incidents well,” Lai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said many were lured to Southeast Asia on bogus job offers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on authorities to raise public awareness about the dangers of getting lured by such schemes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from massive wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles rose to 24 on Sunday, with officials warning of incoming dangerous winds that could whip the blazes up further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fires continued to rip through the United States' second-largest city for the sixth day, reducing whole communities to scorched rubble and leaving thousands without homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massive firefighting efforts have staunched the spread of the Palisades Fire, which was looming toward upscale Brentwood and the densely populated San Fernando Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  But conditions are set to dramatically worsen, with "extreme fire behavior and life threatening conditions" over the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds up to 110 kilometers per hour mean a "particularly dangerous situation (PDS)" will be declared from early Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld.
  <br>
  <br>
  These gusts could fan flames and whip up embers from existing burn zones into new areas, firefighters warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles County Fire Department chief Anthony Marrone said his department had received resources including dozens of new water trucks and firefighters from far afield and was primed to face the renewed threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questioned whether hydrants could run dry again, as they did during the initial outbreak of fires last week, Mayor Karen Bass replied: "I believe the city is prepared." (AFP)

    Pollster under probe over 'assisting absconder'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Security minister Chris Tang has confirmed that national security police are investigating whether pollster Robert Chung or his research organisation had provided assistance to an absconder.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sources earlier said Chung was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute, of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chung was being invited back to the police station for investigations on suspected assistance to an absconder. At this moment in time, Chung has not been arrested," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This has nothing to do with any research being done by Chung or his organisation. Our whole investigation is focusing on how Chung and his organisation [allegedly assisted] the absconder. It's absolutely nothing to do with the result of their poll."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the probe is related to the pollster's former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Chung Kim-wah was last month put on a police wanted list for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is suspected of inciting secession on social media and colluding with foreign forces, and police are offering a HK$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told thousands of business leaders from around the world that Hong Kong is working towards developing itself into an international gold trading centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his opening remarks at the Asian Financial Forum on Monday, Lee revealed that the SAR will build world-class gold storage facilities, and strengthen support services in insurance, testing and certification, as well as logistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, we plan to create a holistic gold trading centre with an industry chain," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stability in Hong Kong amidst rapid changes in geopolitics around the world will provide a world of investors a secure environment for gold storage as well as other forms of wealth management."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the SAR will build on its existing advantages, and expand its overseas network, particularly with Belt and Road countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strategies include strengthening financial cooperation with the Middle East and the 10-member states of ASEAN, as well as other established and emerging markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will also organise more international financial events, seek collaboration in financial products, talent and experience sharing, and attract more overseas enterprises and capital to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18th edition of the two-day Asian Financial Forum - themed "Powering the Next Growth Engine" - has attracted some 3,600 business and financial leaders from more than 50 countries and regions this year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen threw two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills trounced the Denver Broncos 31-7 to cruise into the next round of the NFL playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second-seeded Bills underscored their status as the biggest threat to Kansas City's hopes of reaching a fifth Super Bowl in six seasons by producing a dominant performance at their Highmark Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buffalo's wild card game victory sets up a blockbuster AFC divisional round clash next weekend against third seeded Baltimore, pitting Allen against the Ravens' reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great quarterback obviously with what he's able to do," Bills quarterback Allen said of his looming duel with Jackson. "He's one of the most dynamic if not the most dynamic quarterback in the league. He's fun to watch. But I'll be watching their defence this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen finished with 272 passing yards from 20-of-26 attempts, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with 46 rushing yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventh seeds Denver rocked Buffalo with a touchdown on the first drive of the game, quarterback Bo Nix finding receiver Troy Franklin with a deep pass for a 43-yard touchdown to mute the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills responded with 10 unanswered points, Tyler Bass slotting a 26-yard field goal and James Cook skipping into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver had a chance to tie the game on the stroke of halftime but Wil Lutz's 50-yard field goal attempt bounced back off the posts to leave Buffalo 10-7 ahead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills took a stranglehold on the game in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bass slotted a 27-yard field goal to make it 13-7, and after the Bills defense forced another Denver punt, Ty Johnson snagged a superb catch inches off the ground at the back of the end zone from Allen's pass to make it 19-7. A successful two-point conversion put the Bills 21-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen tossed his second touchdown pass at the start of the fourth quarter, picking out Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard touchdown that took the score to 28-7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's offense continued to be stymied by Buffalo's defense, their impotence summed up by a failure to convert a 4th&2 situation on their next possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen and the Bills took that opportunity to extend the lead to 31-7 with Bass's third field goal of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also means that the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will host the Houston Texans in the divisional round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles advanced in the NFC with a 22-10 win over a disappointing Green Bay Packers in a defensive grind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts returned after missing the past two games following a concussion and he showed no signs of rust with an early 11-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packers quarterback Jordan Love had a tough day, throwing an early interception with Darius Slay snaffling up the pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even when Love did manage to get Green Bay within field goal range, with a 13-play drive in the second quarter, Brandon McManus missed the kick from 38-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Love threw another interception at the end of the half and although McManus reduced the deficit with a 26-yard field goal in the third, Green Bay never looked in contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Goedert put Philadelphia 16-3 up when he collected a pass from Hurts and then burst towards the end-zone, delivering two stiff arms to keep Carrington Valentine at bay as he made the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josh Jacobs gave the Packers some hope with his one-yard rush after he had shown impressive power and strength on the previous play to break a series of tackles and make 31-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was the last productive moment from the Packers with two Jake Elliott field goals wrapping up the win for the Eagles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurts threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns while running back Saquon Barkley had 119-yards on 19 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how it looks and there's some things we can work on, improve on, the defence did a hell of a job and we got the win," said Barkley. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Julián Alvarez's strike helped Atlético Madrid move top of La Liga with 1-0 win over Osasuna.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side climbed one point clear of champions Real Madrid and six ahead of third-placed Barcelona at the halfway mark in the Spanish league season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético claimed a 14th consecutive victory across all competitions, a new club record, and have lost just one top-flight game all season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their eighth straight league win and a fifth clean sheet from those matches, with Simeone's side back to their miserly best in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been doing a great job, we know that it's not over here and there's a long way to go, a lot of games to come," Alvarez said. "We have to continue on this path, to keep working with humility, and good things will come."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético started well against an Osasuna side with several regular starters left on the bench, including their top scorer, striker Ante Budimir.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antoine Griezmann had an early goal ruled out for handball, while his strike-partner Alvarez missed Atlético's best chances of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearest came when Rodrigo De Paul scooped a pass over the top for the Argentina international, but Alvarez's effort, which bounced awkwardly off his shoulder, was saved by Sergio Herrera.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Moreno's visitors, 11th, improved as the first half progressed and managed to keep Atlético largely at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  However early in the second half a clever Rojiblancos corner routine helped them break the deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griezmann's whipped cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger area by Clement Lenglet and Alvarez was able to slam home from close range for his sixth league goal since joining last summer from Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a move we've been working on, we've had some days to train, to make these strategies," explained Alvarez. "Luckily today it came off, it's important to score from dead balls, because it can be decisive, above all in hard-fought games like these, which are tricky."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were not at their sharpest but had more than enough to seal another victory and claim top spot, with Osasuna not troubling Jan Oblak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Getafe earned a 2-1 win at Las Palmas to climb three points above the relegation zone. (AFP)

<img alt="Barcelona celebrates after winning the Spanish Super Cup. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787223_1_20250113072122.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona hammered rivals Real Madrid 5-2 in a wild Spanish Super Cup Clasico final in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to win the first trophy of the Hansi Flick era.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead but a dominant Barcelona hit five in response before their goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to avenge their 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in October's La Liga Clasico but instead were left battered and bruised by their arch-rivals in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Mbappé's opener, Lamine Yamal levelled and Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead from the penalty spot, with Raphinha bagging a brace and Alejandro Balde also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo Goes pulled one back for Madrid with a free-kick but they could not capitalise further on their numerical advantage in a humiliating defeat for the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice, it had been a season since we won a trophy, it's always special and on top of that in a Clasico against Real Madrid," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde said. "We had a lot of calm and patience, knowing that if we applied the plan we would win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very proud and happy with the team," he added. "Right after the red card, we got together and said we were going to have to suffer, sit back, but we had a big advantage and this can't escape us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team's poor defending was the main reason for the heavy defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We defended badly and that cost us the game – they found their goals quite easily," Ancelotti said. "We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that – we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both coaches opted to maintain the same line-ups they started with in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal issued Madrid an early warning with a curling effort from the right which forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a strong stop to keep a Raphinha header at bay after the Brazilian evaded Lucas Vázquez with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Barcelona's opening salvo it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the fifth minute with Mbappé's brilliant goal on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward, frustrated numerous times by the offside flag in the league defeat by the Catalans, broke loose on the halfway line after Vinicius won the ball back and, after bursting into the area, clipped past Szczesny.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took a stunning individual goal from 17-year-old Yamal to level the scoreline, with the Spanish winger cutting in from the right before stroking home a low finish inside the near post in a similar style to former Barca great Lionel Messi, to whom he is often compared. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten-man Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-3 on penalties after a dramatic 1-1 draw in the FA Cup third round, while Tottenham needed extra time before seeing off non-league Tamworth 3-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defeated 2-0 by Arsenal in the Premier League in December, FA Cup holders United exacted revenge on their return to the Emirates Stadium to extend their revival after last weekend's impressive draw at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's troubled side took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, who smashed a superb strike into the far corner from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  United defender Diogo Dalot was sent off for a second booking after fouling Mikel Merino nine minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed Arsenal's equaliser in the 63rd minute, the Brazilian defender swivelling to hit a low shot that took a hefty deflection off Matthijs de Ligt.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal wasted a golden opportunity to take the lead when Harry Maguire's soft challenge on Kai Havertz was ruled a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The furious United defender and team-mate Manuel Ugarte were involved in a melee with several Arsenal players before Altay Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard's spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz missed a host of chances to win it and the German was culpable again in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Bayindir, setting up the much-maligned Joshua Zirkzee to stroke home the decisive kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to pass through this round because we all suffered together and showed character," said Amorim, whose side host Leicester in the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few weeks ago Joshua was in a difficult moment, now he was a game-changer," he added. "Life has these beautiful things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another painful result for Arsenal after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg and last weekend's damaging league draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a thousand games like this you lose one," said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta, who hasn't won a trophy since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's unbelievable," he added. "We deserved to win the game by a mile. But the reality is we are out and the only thing that's going to be judged is that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham, who are currently 12th in the Premier League, are 96 places above Tamworth – who sit 16th in the fifth-tier National League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supposed gap in quality was rarely apparent as Tottenham's dismal display took them to the brink of a historic humiliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A part-time team whose players work day jobs alongside their football careers, Tamworth matched their highly-paid and supposedly superior opponents for long periods on the Lamb Ground's sloping artificial pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should have caused one of the FA Cup's greatest upsets in normal time but their missed chances proved crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Tshikuna's extra-time own goal and late strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson sent Tottenham into the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a major trophy in 2008, but the under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou boasts he always wins silverware in his second season at a club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having beaten Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Tottenham remain in contention for a domestic cup double despite a troubled season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They made it hard for us, with the surface it was about us staying calm and being persistent. In the end, we got the job done," said Postecoglou, whose team travel to Aston Villa in the fourth round. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Sunday that around 1,700 staff members have been deployed to two test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park - but it stressed that this had "not in any way" affected the treatment of patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The clarification came after multiple media reports suggested some patients had to reschedule their bookings because medical staff were drafted in to take part in upcoming drills to gauge the park's crowd management measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the department confirmed that staff will be sent to drills on January 24 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said minor adjustments were made to the appointment dates for non-therapeutic student health services with the consent of service recipients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All have been agreed by the members of the public concerned and only two appointments will be postponed by one working day, while the others will be brought forward by two to 10 working days," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department stressed that the Student Health Service provides regular health assessment and health education of a preventive nature.
  <br>
  <br>
  That said, it pledged to make more careful planning and strengthen internal co-ordination when deploying staff for future drills, so as to minimise disruption to public services.

    Industry to bear cost of cigarette tax labels: Customs

<img alt="Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat says the labelling system is aimed at targeting untaxed cigarettes attempting to pass off as legal, duty-paid ones. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787178_1_20250112155320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs say tobacco firms will likely have to bear the cost of an upcoming labelling system which will help consumers differentiate duty-paid cigarettes from illicit ones.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner of Customs and Excise Chan Tsz-tat explained the proposed scheme is aimed at weeding out untaxed cigarettes which boast identical or similar packaging to their duty-paid counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both feature government health warnings, and can be difficult to distinguish even by retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said one way to implement the scheme is to introduce anti-forgery features on the packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labels will be similar to anti-forgery features on banknotes, which are hard to replicate," Chan told a television programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be a digital tag to be scanned. The tag can be attached when the cigarettes are produced but duty has not been paid. When duty is paid, we can activate the label from the back end. Then we will know the batch has been taxed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed concerns that tobacco companies will transfer the extra costs to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our initial thought is to have the tobacco industry shoulder the cost. Currently, a pack of cigarettes on the market is sold for over HK$100. The cost of adding labels is minimal and will have no impact on the selling price," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also looking to introduce stiffer penalties for people who flout a law on the permitted amount of cigarettes they can bring into Hong Kong tax-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, each traveller can carry 19 sticks of cigarettes every time they enter the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officials are looking to amend legislation within this year, so offenders will be fined HK$5,000, up from HK$2,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US authorities have extended the deadline for Japan's Nippon Steel to abandon its acquisition of its American rival after President Joe Biden blocked the deal, the companies said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden cited national security concerns as he put a stop to the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to the Japanese giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing the president of "illegal interference", the companies filed a legal review with the US court of appeals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will now hold off enforcing the order until June 18, Nippon Steel and US Steel said, extending an initial 30-day deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) has granted an extension to June 18, 2025 of the requirement in President Biden's Executive Order that the parties permanently abandon the transaction," the companies said in a joint statement.

  <br>
  "We look forward to completing the transaction, which secures the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the outgoing president's decision to block the transaction enjoyed rare bipartisan support at home, it drew sharp criticism from the Japanese government and business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's industry minister labelled it "incomprehensible" and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called on Washington to "explain clearly" its rationale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to appropriately deal with the issue while not undermining the big picture of the Japan-US alliance," Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will ask the US side to remove concerns which are spreading in the business community," he said during a television debate. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour's play was possible outside by early evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn't get any tennis," said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've paid 60 bucks and haven't seen anything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na's Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old's last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes," Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let's keep going playing with pressure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men's second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty nice, man. First time in my life I'm playing on a good court," the 20th seed said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it's much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Women's favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena. (Reuters)

<img alt="Paul Chan said a new chapter discussing cooperation with Gulf countries has been added to this week's Asian Financial Forum. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787162_1_20250112122438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial secretary said an annual financial forum this week includes a new discussion panel on how to cooperate with Gulf countries, as Hong Kong looks to grasp development opportunities with the Global South.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paul Chan said the Asian Financial Forum - set to begin on Monday - will host some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions, a scale similar to last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The forum sets up a new chapter on the Gulf Cooperation Council, making new explorations on how to deepen financial cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, while encouraging more bilateral capital flows," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged Hong Kong businesses to grasp the new development opportunities brought by the emerging markets. These include the Middle East, as well as nations from Asean and the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also noted that the SAR serve as a platform for countries like Indonesia to raise funds for products such as catastrophe bonds, or infrastructure and green projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, he led a 130-strong delegation to Jakarta to conduct business exchange and lure investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said given the risks of disasters brought by climate change, companies can opt for Hong Kong's catastrophe bond products, raise funds through issuing bonds in different currencies, or establish trusts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that Indonesian representatives also expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's innovation and technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten startups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park took part in dozens of business matching sessions, potentially reeling in over US$5 million of business, Chan revealed.

<img alt="The suspended South Korean president has been holed up in the presidential residence since his short-lived declaration of martial law. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787171_1_20250112144935.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk-yeol will not attend the first hearing of his impeachment trial next week because of safety concerns, his lawyer said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been holed up in the presidential residence and protected by an elite guard force since being suspended and impeached last month, following a short-lived declaration of martial law that plunged the country into political chaos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has refused to meet prosecutors and investigators and his presidential guard unit thwarted an attempt to arrest him following a tense, hours-long standoff earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has scheduled five trial dates spanning January 14 to February 4, which will proceed in his absence if he does not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the President will not be able to attend the trial on January 14," lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement sent to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The President is willing to appear at any time once safety issues are resolved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The court will decide whether to uphold his impeachment or restore him to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, investigators seeking to question Yoon on insurrection charges linked to his ill-fated martial law declaration are preparing another arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyers have repeatedly said an initial seven-day warrant and the new one they secured this week were both "unlawful".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have kept secret the length of the new warrant, with local media reports saying it is longer than the previous seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rival protesters for and against Yoon have gathered almost daily in the South Korean capital since the crisis unfolded.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday more demonstrations were planned by rival camps outside Yoon's residence and on the streets of Seoul -- either calling for his impeachment to be declared invalid or for him to be detained immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's legal team say his guards remain on "high alert".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested if investigators are able to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If convicted, he faces prison or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) officials and police are planning for the next attempt, which they said could be their last.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO said anyone obstructing their attempt could be detained themselves and police reportedly held a meeting of top commanders on Friday to plan for the renewed effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Presidential Security Service (PSS) chief Park Chong-jun -- who resigned on Friday and was automatically replaced by a more hardline Yoon loyalist -- told reporters there must be no bloodshed in any second arrest attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced two days of questioning and did not explain his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am cooperating as diligently as possible with the authorities' investigation," he told reporters Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, acting PSS chief Kim Seong-hun, refused to turn up to a third summons on Saturday claiming he had to protect Yoon, opening him up to possible arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jin-ha, head of the service's security and safety division, was questioned on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Office of Investigation, a police unit, sent a note to high-ranking police officials in Seoul requesting they prepare to mobilise 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt, the Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the crisis goes on Yoon's ruling party has seen a bump in approval ratings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Gallup survey published Friday showed the People Power Party's approval rating had risen to 34 percent from 24 percent three weeks ago. (AFP)

<img alt="The Security Bureau is leading a dedicated task force, with members from Police and the Immigration Department to Thailand to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents being forced to work.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A six-member task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk has set off for Thailand on Sunday to investigate reports of Hong Kong residents allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  The task force comprises officials from the Security Bureau, as well as police and the Immigration Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Cheuk said the Thai government is very concerned about the issue and is willing to arrange a meeting with SAR officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, we have been communicating with the relevant authorities. In terms of the latest development, we hope to meet them face-to-face and understand the situation and to seek all feasible help from them and see how we collaborate," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for the operation goal, we for sure want all Hongkongers to come back safely. This is our ultimate goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted criminals are adopting new methods to lure victims to Southeast Asian countries. These include asking people to help bring packages to Japan or Taiwan, but then changing the destination to a Southeast Asian country at the last minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force will also meet officials from the Chinese embassy in Bangkok, and talk to Ministry of Justice representatives on an anti-human trafficking committee chaired by the Thai prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen have already returned to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said the remaining 12 are aged 21 to 43, and none were abducted. They reported restrictions on their movement but are safe and able to remain in touch with the task force, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to media enquiries, the Security Bureau revealed on Saturday that it had recently received an assistance request from the family of an SAR resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The woman, in her twenties, was reportedly detained in a Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the case had since been taken up by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, and the local Chinese Embassy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The relevant parities provided advice and all feasible help based on the family’s wishes, and it is understood the woman has returned to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Security Bureau called on the public to be vigilant against online job advertisements which are too good to be true - either those which claim to offer quick money, or highly-paid positions which do not require any work experience or academic qualification.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hill fire which had been burning in Pat Heung since Saturday afternoon was largely put out after more than 20 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fire Services Department said Sunday that the Government Flying Service is also water bombing the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze near Kai Kung Leng, literally meaning Rooster Ridge, once stretched to 200 metres from one end to the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency services first received reports about the fire at around 5.30pm on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Government Flying Service helicopter was deployed later that evening to extract two hikers trapped inside Lam Tsuen Country Park due to the fire and strong winds. They were both evacuated safely.

    2025 full of uncertainties and challenges: HKMA chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City dashed the dreams of Salford's former Manchester United star owners with an 8-0 FA Cup rout on Saturday, while Liverpool cruised into the fourth round with a 4-0 victory over Accrington Stanley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea were among the other big winners with a 5-0 demolition of Morecambe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford were the only Premier League side to fall to lower-league opposition as Plymouth, who sit bottom of the Championship, stunned the Bees 1-0 thanks to Morgan Whittaker's late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  League Two Salford have risen through the non-league ranks since investment from David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt began in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholes, Butt and director of football Giggs were in attendance at the Etihad but were denied a night to rival their best during glorious playing careers at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola made wholesale changes as Erling Haaland was afforded a rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku opened the scoring after just eight minutes before youngsters Divin Mubama and Nico O'Reilly made it 3-0 before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish scored his first City goal for over a year from the penalty spot, while Doku also netted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  But James McAtee, who had only scored once for City previously, earned man-of-the-match honours with a 20-minute second-half hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever," said McAtee.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was never any hint of an upset at Anfield either despite Arne Slot making eight changes for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold was named captain in the absence of Virgil van Dijk and led by example after being criticised for his display in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had warned the Premier League leaders that a trip to Anfield would be Accrington's "Champions League final".
  <br>
  <br>
  A mammoth 86 league positions behind Liverpool in the 92-team English league system, Stanley held out for nearly half an hour before Diogo Jota was left with a simple task to tap in from Darwin Nunez's low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander-Arnold then stepped forward to double the lead with a sumptuous hit into the top corner from outside the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could talk for hours about that (goal), unbelievable," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest compliment Trent could get was the reaction of everyone after the Manchester United game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player around the world, maybe except for a few, has a bad game and that is completely normal, but the moment Trent has one, everyone has an opinion about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayden Danns made it 3-0 before Federico Chiesa netted his first Liverpool goal after an injury-hit start to his time in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Felix was the star of the show for Chelsea as he got a rare chance to deputise for Cole Palmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese international and Tosin Adarabioyo both scored twice, while Christopher Nkunku made up for missing an early penalty by netting his 13th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only Liverpool have taken more points at home than Brentford in the Premier League this season, while Plymouth had not won away from home all campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet against the odds Argyle, who sacked former England captain Wayne Rooney 12 days ago, held out and hit Thomas Frank's men with a sucker punch when Whittaker blasted in from outside the area nine minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have pride in everybody, and I'm pleased for the supporters. It's a big day for us," said caretaker Plymouth boss Kevin Nancekivell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FA Cup brings that romance and we've put a little bit of history in it today by getting the win."
  <br>
  <br>
  High-flying Nottingham Forest continued their excellent season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Luton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were 4-0 winners at Norwich as Georginio Rutter struck twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth shrugged off the loss of strikers Evanilson and Enes Unal to long-term injuries this week to roar back from 1-0 down to hammer West Brom 5-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester went one better by hitting QPR for six in an eight-goal thriller at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' bright start under new boss Vitor Pereira continued as early goals from Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rodrigo Gomes secured a 2-1 win at Bristol City. (AFP)

    Gaza agency says eight dead in Israel strike on school

<img alt="The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787125_1_20250111221700.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli air strike on a school-turned-shelter on Saturday killed eight people, including two children, while the Israeli military said it targeted Hamas militants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal confirmed eight people, including two children and two women, were killed by Israeli shelling on the Halwa school in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bassal said the strike wounded 30 people, including 19 children, and that the Halwa school housed "thousands of displaced people."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military, in a statement, acknowledged it conducted a strike on the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the air force "conducted a precise strike on terrorists in a command-and-control centre" that had previously served as the Halwa school in Jabalia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it targeted the premises because "the school had been used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for more than 14 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A strike on the United Nations-run Al-Jawni school in central Gaza on September 11 drew an international outcry after the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said six of its staff were among the 18 reported dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military accuses Hamas of hiding in school buildings where thousands of Gazans have sought shelter – a charge denied by the Palestinian militant group.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 46,537 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the war began, according to data provided by the health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged these figures as reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October 7 attack that triggered it resulted in the deaths of 1,208 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which includes hostages killed in captivity. (AFP)

    Los Angeles investigates fire blame as curfew enforced

<img alt="Abandoned cars sit on Sunset Boulevard following the Palisades Fire. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787121_1_20250111210945.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Californians on Friday demanded to know who is at fault for the vast devastation caused by the raging Los Angeles wildfires, as a strict curfew went into force to prevent looting and lawlessness.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 11 people died as flames ripped through neighbourhoods and razed thousands of homes in a disaster that US President Joe Biden likened to a "war scene."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Angelenos grapple with the heart-rending ruin, anger has risen over officials' preparedness and response, particularly for a series of false evacuation alarms and after fire hydrants ran dry as firefighters battled the initial blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered a "full independent review" of the city's utilities, describing the lack of water supplies during the initial fires as "deeply troubling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need answers to how that happened," he wrote in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents like Nicole Perri, whose home in the upscale Pacific Palisades burnt down, said that officials had "completely let us down."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They let us, the ordinary people, burn," added Nicholas Norman, across the city in Altadena.
  <br>
  <br>
  A flare-up late on Friday prompted new mandatory evacuations from ritzy neighbourhoods along the fire's eastern flank, which include the famous Getty Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  Built at a cost of US$1 billion and constructed partly of fire-resistant travertine stone, the acclaimed museum boasts 125,000 artworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, as fears of looting grow, a sunset-to-sunrise curfew took effect in evacuated areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around two dozen arrests have already been made across Los Angeles, where some residents have organised street patrols and kept armed watch over their own houses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we see you in these areas, you will be subject to arrest," Los Angeles Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violators face up to six months in prison or US$1,000 fines, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Guard has been deployed to bolster law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five separate fires have so far burned more than 37,000 acres (15,000 hectares), destroying around 10,000 buildings, California's fire agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office confirmed an additional fatality on Friday, bringing the overall death toll so far to 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It reminded me of more of a war scene, where you had certain targets that were bombarded," said Biden, as he received a briefing on the fires at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winds calmed on Friday, providing a much-needed if fleeting window of opportunity for firefighters battling blazes around the clock for a fourth consecutive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the biggest of the blazes, in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, firefighters said they were starting to get the fire under control, with eight percent of its perimeter contained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Braveheart" actor Mel Gibson was the latest celebrity to reveal his Malibu home had burned down, telling NewsNation the loss was "devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire in the Altadena area was three percent contained, with fire chief Jason Schillinger reporting "significant progress" in quelling the blaze.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third fire that exploded on Thursday afternoon near the wealthy Hidden Hills enclave, home to celebrities like Kim Kardashian, was 50 percent surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  But emergency chiefs warned the situation is "still very dangerous" and reprieve from the intense gusts that spread embers will not last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The winds have died down today, but... are going to increase again in the coming days," said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have said it was too early to know the cause of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden took a veiled swipe at incoming president Donald Trump, who has spread misinformation over the flames that has then been amplified on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You're going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it," Biden said of the fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Governor Newsom, who has been blamed for the disaster by the president-elect, invited Trump to visit Los Angeles and survey the devastation with him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the spirit of this great country, we must not politicise human tragedy or spread disinformation from the sidelines," said Newsom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occur naturally, but scientists say human-caused climate change is altering weather and changing the dynamics of the blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two wet years in southern California have given way to a very dry one, leaving ample fuel on the ground primed to burn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emergency managers apologised on Friday after false evacuation alerts were erroneously sent to millions of mobile phones, sparking panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't express enough how sorry I am," said Kevin McGowan, the director of the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles fire chief Kristin Crowley blamed recent funding cuts, telling Fox News affiliate KTTV her department was chronically "understaffed" and "under-resourced." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 200,000 people visited an exhibition in Dubai showcasing the appeal and vibrancy of Hong Kong through interactive art technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "Immersive Hong Kong" exhibition was part of Hong Kong's broader initiative to strengthen ties with the Middle East, with Chief Executive John Lee and other senior officials leading delegations to the region since 2023, to tell good stories of the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event, held from December 20 last year to January 5, was organised by the Information Services Department and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apollonia Liu, the Director of Information Services, said the city has been fostering closer ties with the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very delighted with the positive response as well as the expansion of our circle of friends and network through staging this exhibition," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Information Services Department said it will explore organising the exhibition in other cities later this year, after already holding it in Dubai, Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Guangzhou.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Saturday met with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who is in Beijing for the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  China and the UK are both major economies and financial heavyweights in the world, Han said, pointing out that strengthening economic and financial cooperation in the spirit of strategic partnership is of great significance to promoting economic growth, improving people's lives and encouraging green development in these two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also inject confidence and impetus into the development of the world economy, Han added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to continue to expand openness and exchanges with the UK, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to bring more benefits to the two countries and the world, said Han.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves, meanwhile, said the resumption of this dialogue after nearly six years is of great significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British side attaches importance to developing relations with China and is willing to strengthen candid dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation with China to promote the economic development of each country, she added. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,000 flights were cancelled on Friday and thousands more were hit by delays due to a storm in the southern United States, airlines and tracking website FlightAware reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delta Airlines said a "worse-than-expected mix of winter weather" prompted the shutdown of all five runways at Atlanta International Airport for more than two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Delta cancelled approximately 1,100 flights across our network" on Friday, the carrier said as it was "working to recover the airline heading into Saturday."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Delta plane also had to abort take-off at Atlanta because of an engine problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 passengers and crew aboard the Boeing 757-300 had to exit via emergency slides, US media reported citing a company statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Fort Worth (Texas) and Charlotte Douglas (North Carolina) were also affected by the bad weather, with more than 1,200 flights cancelled across the two airports according to FlightAware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tracking website recorded more than 3,000 cancellations in total on Friday across multiple airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States was already hit by a winter storm at the start of the week, leaving at least five people dead and prompting hundreds of flights to be scrapped as it swept across the centre and east of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temperatures plummeted below zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) in some places and tens of thousands of people were left without electricity. (AFP)

    'It's great to be back': Moyes returns as Everton boss

<img alt="David Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787106_1_20250111175717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 David Moyes has returned as Everton manager following Sean Dyche's sacking, the struggling Premier League club announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "David is widely recognised as one of the Premier League's most experienced and accomplished managers, having led Everton for more than 500 matches from 2002 to 2013," a statement on the club's website read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that David is joining us at this pivotal time in Everton's history," Everton's executive chairman Marc Watts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With over a decade of experience at the club, he is the right leader to propel us through our final season at Goodison Park and into our new stadium. We look forward to working with David to build the foundation of a new era for Everton," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to be back! I enjoyed 11 wonderful and successful years at Everton and didn't hesitate when I was offered the opportunity to rejoin this great club," Moyes remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's new owners, the Friedkin Group, moved for Moyes after dismissing Dyche just hours before Thursday's 2-0 win against Peterborough in the FA Cup third-round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract to return to Everton 12 years after leaving for an unsuccessful spell in charge of Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 61-year-old Scot has been out of work since leaving West Ham at the end of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to start his second spell as Everton boss against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes remains popular with Everton fans after his 11-year stint in charge from 2002 to 2013, a period that included a fourth-place finish in 2005 and an FA Cup final appearance in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche's two-year reign came to an abrupt end on Thursday after Everton's defeat at Bournemouth on January 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Chelsea boss Graham Potter was said to be Everton's top target but he joined West Ham, with Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Fenerbahce in Turkey, also reportedly distancing himself from the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes will be tasked with leading Everton away from the relegation zone as they prepare to usher in a new era at their Bramley Moore Dock Stadium from next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche managed only one win in his last 11 games in charge, leaving them just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Everton defender Leighton Baines, now the club's under-18s head coach, and captain Seamus Coleman took charge for the win against third tier Peterborough. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I'm Comin,’” has died. He was 89.
 <br>
  <br>
  Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died on Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many ’60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers. (AP)

<img alt="Gael Monfils of France hits a return to Zizou Berges of Belgium during their singles final match at the ATP Auckland Classic, in Auckland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787094_1_20250111153952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gael Monfils became the oldest singles champion in ATP Tour history when the 38-year-old Frenchman swept to victory in the final of the Auckland Classic on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monfils outclassed Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs 6-3, 6-4, to eclipse Swiss great Roger Federer in the record books, a day before the start of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils powered to a 13th career title and became the oldest player to win an ATP final since the Tour launched in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federer was two months younger when he won the Swiss Indoors in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flamboyant Monfils roared and flexed to the crowd after clinching victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was proud to win at an age when others have usually hung up the racquet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Age is a number but I keep working," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I keep believing that I can play high quality tennis and I've been showing it this week so I'm very happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils won his first ATP Tour title in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was 20 years ago, I still have the passion to play tennis, I still feel like I strike a very good ball so hopefully many more to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot conditions, the Frenchman defied his age to play with greater athleticism than Bergs, who was contesting his first final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bergs dropped his serve early in both sets and lacked the firepower to break back against Monfils's clinical serve and varied groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils will rise 11 places to 41st in the world after his victory, taking the momentum into Melbourne, where he faces fellow Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round of the Australian Open. (AFP)

    Jeju Air black boxes stopped recording before crash

<img alt="Investigators say the boxes are crucial to their probe but added they would not give up on trying to find out why the crash happened.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The black boxes holding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the crashed Jeju Air flight that left 179 people dead stopped recording four minutes before the disaster, South Korea's transport ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737-800 was flying from Thailand to Muan, South Korea, on December 29 carrying 181 passengers and crew when it belly-landed at the Muan airport and exploded in a fireball after slamming into a concrete barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The analysis revealed that both the CVR and FDR data were not recorded during the four minutes leading up to the aircraft's collision with the localiser," the transport ministry said in a statement, referring to the two recording devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser is a barrier at the end of the runway that helps with aircraft landings and was blamed for exacerbating the crash's severity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Plans are in place to investigate the cause of the data loss during the ongoing accident investigation," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators are still probing the cause of the crash of Jeju Air flight 2216, which prompted a national outpouring of mourning with memorials set up across the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing, then crashed on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Lakers coach J.J. Redick says he hopes the team's eventual return to play can "give people hope" after seeing his Pacific Palisades home incinerated in the deadly wildfires that have ravaged the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers postponed a scheduled home game against Charlotte on Thursday because of the fires, which have left at least 11 people dead and destroyed around 10,000 homes and other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick oversaw practice on Friday for what was expected to be an emotionally charged home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, but that game too was postponed in a decision announced by NBA league chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers' game against Charlotte set for Saturday was also postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick is one of several members of the Lakers organization directly impacted by the fires, seeing his family's rented property in Pacific Palisades, the ground zero of the disaster, consumed by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Redick became emotional as he spoke to reporters about the personal impact of the disaster on his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years," said Redick, who was living in the house with his wife, Chelsea, and their two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was not prepared for what I saw," Redick said of visiting Pacific Palisades after returning home from the Lakers' road game at Dallas in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that stage, Redick's family had been evacuated to a hotel. The Lakers coach then paid a visit to his home early on Wednesday to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was complete devastation and destruction. I went a different way to the house through the village, and it's all gone," Redick said. "I don't think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick said his family had lost "irreplaceable" items in the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything that we owned that was of any importance to us in almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting was in that house." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong experienced its coldest day so far this winter, with the observatory recording a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees at its Tsim Sha Tsui headquarters on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mercury dipped even lower in parts of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the forecaster warned of possible frost on Saturday morning, on high ground or in the northern part of the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, hikers in Tai Mo Shan told RTHK that they hadn't seen any frost overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would create a really memorable experience. We'll take some photos if we see it. There's a small chance it could happen, but I won't be disappointed if we don't see it," said a hiker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory reminded the public to wrap up warm and maintain proper indoor ventilation, adding that chilly weather is expected on Sunday morning.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs chief Chan Tsz-tat stressed that safety takes priority for officers and they must hold themselves accountable for their actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  A 27-year-old motorcyclist was killed last week in Kowloon Bay, after his vehicle rammed into an iron pole, and a 40-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of tampering with a motor vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs earlier said it was a tragic incident, and confirmed that one of their officers was involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Chan said the case has been undergoing investigation and the involved frontline officer is now on leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan stressed that officers should contribute to society within legal and safe circumstances, and be responsible for every action even if they are not on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have all along provided very comprehensive training for our staff members, starting from joining our department to on-the-job training, we have set very clear instructions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the case, I must reiterate that safety is our primary consideration, no matter if a staff member is carrying out his duty in his official capacity or as a private citizen."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Saturday said the government must inform parents about which schools are not offering on-site flu shots so they can plan to get their children vaccinated elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comment came a day after the Department of Health named 168 schools that refused to take part in a voluntary on-campus vaccination programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said the transparency isn't about damaging school reputations but about protecting children's health.

  "If the parents are not aware that their school does not offer the program, they will not be aware that they would need to bring their kids to a private clinic or whatever facility and arrange the vaccination for their own kids," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have the responsibility to inform the public and especially the parents. So it's not a matter of affecting the reputation of a certain school. I think this is a fact and we all have the same mission and that is to protect our kids especially in this winter flu season."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health chief also said that the winter influenza season has officially begun, with a four-year-old boy who didn't get a flu shot and whose school didn't offer vaccines, now in intensive care.

  Separately, Lo said elderly patients no longer need to wait in long queues outside dental clinics in cold weather with the new online appointment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that at the age of 80, our elderly will still be able to retain their [teeth], at least have more than 20 teeth. That would save a lot of our resources in providing treatment for them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo added that officials are planning to expand the student dental care programme to include both kindergarten and secondary students within this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Graham Potter suffered a painful start to his West Ham reign as Aston Villa's late surge sealed a 2-1 win in the FA Cup third round on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Potter was hired by the Hammers on Thursday to replace Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked earlier this week after just six months in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former Chelsea manager was unable to make a winning return to the dug-out as West Ham squandered the first half lead given to them by Lucas Paqueta.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing evening at Villa Park, Unai Emery's men emphasised the size of the task facing Potter with a second half fightback that exposed West Ham's defensive flaws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amadou Onana equalised before Morgan Rogers bagged the winner to leave Potter holding his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Brighton boss is back in management for the first time since being dismissed by Chelsea in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter lasted less than seven months at Chelsea, losing 11 times in his 31 games in charge and slumping to 11th place in the top-flight despite a 288 million pound spending spree in his one transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter has tried to learn from the "pain" of that failure, vowing to "come back stronger" after an experience that may have cost him a chance at the England job when Thomas Tuchel was hired last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter had just one training session with his players before the trip to Villa and was without key forwards Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the circumstances, he can be encouraged by West Ham's attacking play but fixing their issues at the back must be top of his to-do list.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall, disappointed to go out, but lots of positives in the game," Potter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The start was really good but in the second half Aston Villa stepped-up and pushed us back a bit too much. That's something we will have to improve."
  <br>
