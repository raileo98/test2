<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pakistani Taliban claimed a brazen overnight raid on an army outpost near the border with Afghanistan on Saturday, which intelligence officials said killed 16 soldiers and critically wounded five more.
 <br>
  <br>
  The siege started after midnight and lasted about two hours as around 30 militants pummelled the mountainous outpost from three sides, one senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixteen soldiers were martyred and five were critically injured in the assault," he said. "The militants set fire to the wireless communication equipment, documents and other items present at the checkpoint."
  <br>
  <br>
  A second intelligence official also anonymously confirmed the toll of dead and wounded in the attack in the Makeen area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 40 kilometres from the Afghan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's domestic chapter of the Taliban claimed the attack in a statement, saying it was staged "in retaliation for the martyrdom of our senior commanders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group claimed to have seized a hoard of military gear including machine guns and a night vision device.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's military has not yet issued a statement on the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan has been battling a resurgence of militant violence in its western border regions since the Taliban's 2021 return to power in Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad accuses Kabul's rulers of failing to root out militants staging attacks on Pakistan from over the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pakistani Taliban – known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) – share a common ideology with their Afghan counterparts who surged back to power three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kabul's new rulers have pledged to evict foreign militant groups from Afghan soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a UN Security Council report in July estimated up to 6,500 TTP fighters are based there – and said "the Taliban do not conceive of TTP as a terrorist group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said the Afghan Taliban show "ad hoc support to, and tolerance of, TTP operations, including the supplying of weapons and permission for training."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spike in attacks has soured Islamabad-Kabul relations. Security was cited as one reason for Pakistan's campaign last year to evict hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghan migrants. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A projectile fired from Yemen struck Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv early on Saturday, wounding 16 people, the military and emergency service providers said, the second such attack within days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it had failed to intercept the projectile, which struck a district of Tel Aviv municipality, forcing many residents to leave their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it used a ballistic missile and was directed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Iranian-backed Houthis have repeatedly launched missile attacks against Israel in solidarity with Palestinians since the war in Gaza began more than a year ago, most of which have been intercepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, Israel has struck multiple targets in Yemen, including ports and energy facilities in areas controlled by the Huthis. (AFP)

    Winter solstice drives Hongkongers to spend more

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers appeared to be more generous with their spending as they prepared for winter solstice gatherings on Saturday, but wet market stall-holders remained cautious about their business.
 <br>
  <br>
  The day, in Chinese tradition, is typically celebrated with family, when people gather for a meal at home or at a restaurant.
  <br>
  <br>
  People at wet markets were looking to spend a bit more than usual, with some opting to shop for hot pot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I plan to spend around HK$1,000... I think I should stay home to celebrate during holidays," said shopper Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another shopper, surnamed Cheung, said he was willing to almost double his usual spending of HK$300 and had a budget of more than HK$500.
  <br>
  <br>
  But vendors at wet markets were not hoping for a jump in business on the festive day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There isn't much of a difference nowadays whether it's a holiday or not... There are fewer large families and fewer people are buying ingredients at the market," said merchant Yeung. "Business has gotten worse one year after the other."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Business has been a bit quieter than before... Although there were fewer people, some still came to the wet market to shop because they know it's winter solstice," said another stall owner.

<img alt="Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell drives to the basket on his way to 27 points. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784496_1_20241221154234.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers delivered a reality check to newly crowned NBA Cup champions Milwaukee on Friday, dominating the Bucks 124-101 to push their league-best record to 24-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Darius Garland added 16 for the Cavs, who led by as many as 36 points as the Bucks struggled in the absence of injured guard Damian Lillard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks to victory in the NBA Cup final against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, scored 33 points with 14 rebounds and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, back from illness, scored 14 points off the bench for Milwaukee, but starting guards Andre Jackson Jr and AJ Green were a combined 0-for-9 from the field, neither contributing a point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, winners of seven of their last eight, improved to 15-1 at home and got good news with the season debut of Max Strus – who had been sidelined with hip and ankle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strus scored nine points in 19:07 minutes off the bench for Cleveland and drilled three of their 20 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on both ends of the floor," Mitchell said. "We set the tone, offensively, defensively. Knowing they had a long trip back (we were) trying to get going early, push the pace, and we did it for 48 minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who had called it "weird" to pick up regular-season action after playing the semi-finals and final of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas, said the game was not a good gauge of where the Bucks are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat, tired, whatever you want to call it," Rivers said. "There's no read on tonight's game... give them all the credit."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Philadelphia, the 76ers' star center Joel Embiid wore a protective mask as he returned after missing one game because of a sinus fracture to score 34 points in a 108-98 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid, who had been expected to sit out at least through Saturday after taking an inadvertent blow to the face last week, added five rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 23 points and Kelly Oubre Jr added 22 for Philadelphia, who notched their fourth win in five games as they try to climb into the race for a play-in berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid has been largely absent from the Sixers' stuttering season. The 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player was appearing in just his seventh game of the campaign after his troublesome left knee delayed his season debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oklahoma City Thunder, who fell to the Bucks in the Cup final on Tuesday, notched their second victory since then, beating the Heat 104-97 in Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Williams scored 33 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 25 for the Thunder, who were coming off a victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Heat, but Miami clearly missed the contribution of star forward Jimmy Butler, who departed in the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's Bam Adebayo departed briefly in the third quarter after taking an accidental elbow over his left eye. He returned after receiving seven stitches and finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. (AFP)

    Indian denies hospital rape and murder of doctor

<img alt="Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined doctors in protests after the brutal attack. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784491_1_20241221151438.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Indian man on trial for raping and murdering a 31-year-old doctor has pleaded not guilty, his lawyer said on Saturday, a crime that appalled the nation and triggered wide-scale protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  The discovery of the doctor's bloodied body at a government hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata on August 9 sparked nationwide anger at the chronic issue of violence against women.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanjoy Roy, 33, the lone accused in the case, pleaded not guilty before the judge in a closed court on Friday in Kolkata, his lawyer Sourav Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not guilty, your honour, I have been framed," Roy told the court, Bandyopadhyay said, repeating his client's words.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy, a civic volunteer in the hospital, was arrested the day after the murder and has been held in custody since.
  <br>
  <br>
  He would potentially face the death penalty if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court began hearings on November 11, listening to evidence from some 50 witnesses, but it was on Friday that Roy took the stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Judge Anirban Das questioned him with more than 100 questions during the six-hour-long on-camera deposition, that continued until late in the evening," Bandyopadhyay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roy had earlier proclaimed his innocence to the public while screaming from a prison van outside the court before a hearing in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors in Kolkata went on strike for weeks in response to the brutal attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tens of thousands of ordinary Indians joined in the protests, which focused anger on the lack of measures for female doctors to work without fear.
  <br>
  <br>
  India's Supreme Court has ordered a national task force to examine how to bolster security for healthcare workers, saying the brutality of the killing had "shocked the conscience of the nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gruesome nature of the attack drew comparisons with the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a Delhi bus, which also sparked weeks of nationwide protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial continues. The next hearing is set for January 2, 2025. (AFP)

    'Voluntary reporting of illegal structure not amnesty'

<img alt="Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn (centre) says bringing back voluntary reporting of unauthorised building works in village houses doesn't equate to an amnesty. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784478_1_20241221114459.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn said on Saturday that a proposal to bring back the mechanism for voluntary reporting of unauthorised building works in village houses in the New Territories doesn't equate to granting them amnesty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The previous reporting period lasted for eight months in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  Property owners who reported unauthorised building works that were built on or before June 28 2011 and imposed less risk didn’t have to fix them immediately, but had to conduct regular safety inspections every five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said that the department doesn’t have enough staff to deal with all the cases at present, but stressed that the scheme does not mean property owners don't need to do anything.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like we won’t prosecute you for the unauthorised works even if you have find someone to conduct regular inspections,” she said on an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said it may take until 2030 for the department to complete other more urgent matters in urban areas, and then they'll look at how to handle the village house situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development minister noted that the Buildings Department has so far checked  roughly 60,000 village houses, out of about 99,000, and found that around half had unauthorised building work.
  <br>
  <br>
  There could be over 100,000 unauthorised building works among all village houses in total, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Linn reiterated plans to toughen fines for unauthorised building works isn’t about punishing people, but about getting them to take the issue seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government hopes to amend the Buildings Ordinance, including raising the maximum fine for unauthorised building works from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities are also proposing a fixed penalty of HK$6,000 for owners who ignore statutory building inspection notices, which apply to premises that are 30 years old or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government's intention is not to punish our property owners or citizens. What we hope is that through our legislation, we can establish rigorous provisions that encourage and urge everyone to comply with the law,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have many ageing buildings. We want to prompt everyone to take the requirement for building inspections seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will seek input from the public and professional groups when the two-month consultation on the proposal begins later this month.

    Paediatrician warns of 'severe' flu season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician on Saturday has urged the public not to lower their guard this flu season, urging Hongkongers to get vaccinated for what could be a severe winter flu season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mike Kwan, from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said infection numbers are expected to spike in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the SAR's flu season might be comparable to Australia's experience earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking back [at] Australia, the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season in fact was quite severe. So I expect, in the Northern Hemisphere this winter, our flu season will still be quite severe," Kwan said after appearing on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is why we are advocating the flu vaccination to all our citizens. The severity of flu infections in our community really depends on the percentage of our vaccinations, what we regard as herd immunity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwan said the vaccination rate among children aged six months to three years was relatively low.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Ocean Park said on Saturday that thousands of visitors have flocked daily to see An An and Ke Ke, the pair of pandas gifted by the central government, since their public debut earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Pong also told a Commercial Radio Programme that he's optimistic that December visitor numbers will show a significant increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've noticed more visitors from Southeast Asia, and it's great to see people from Europe and the US coming back too. That's why we are expecting good results this month,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said tourists from India and the Philippines are surging as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Tourists from India are topping the charts this year, with a fourfold increase for 2023-2024. Well, the base numbers might be low, but the growth from India and the Philippines is still quite impressive,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many local families are also expected to visit the theme park over the weekend and also the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme park posted a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June even though visitor numbers and revenue reached five-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said 30 percent of the park’s spending is earmarked for conservation and education work, which he described as “hard to measure in monetary terms.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the park understands the importance of achieving break-even and will work hard to broaden its income sources, including launching panda-themed products and attracting new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed hope of getting longer term government subsidies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, Ocean Park receives government funding of HK$280 million each year to cover its expenditure on conservation and education work. But this is scheduled to end in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pong noted experts estimated the twin panda cubs will be safe and ready to meet the public when they turn six months old, which will be around February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said it might be tricky to have the twins and their parents, Ying Ying and Le Le, appear together in one venue, noting the park needs to monitor how they interact and their safety is the park's priority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 German police arrested a Saudi Arabian man after a deadly car-ramming attack on a Christmas market Friday in which an SUV barrelled through a crowd of revellers at high speed, leaving a trail of bloody carnage.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least two people were killed, one of them a young child, and 68 injured, said authorities in the city of Magdeburg, located about 130 kilometres (80 miles) southwest of Berlin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect was a 50-year-old medical doctor from Saudi Arabia living in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, said regional premier Reiner Haseloff, speaking at a scene cordoned off and guarded by police commandos.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have arrested the perpetrator, a man from Saudi Arabia, a doctor who has been in Germany since 2006," he told reporters, calling the attack a "catastrophe" for the city and the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From what we currently know he was a lone attacker so we don't think there is any further danger."
  <br>
  <br>
  German media partially named the suspect as Taleb A. and said he was a doctor of psychiatry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The black BMW barrelled through the crowd at high speed just after 7:00 pm local time (1800 GMT) when the market was filled with revellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage showed the driver's arrest as police with their handguns trained shouted "lie down, hands on your back, don't move!" at the bearded man with glasses who was lying on the ground next to the heavily damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the vehicle drove "at least 400 metres across the Christmas market" leaving a trail of bloodied casualties, debris and broken glass at the city's central town hall square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the chaotic site, which was doused in blue police lights and wailing sirens, as badly injured people were treated on site and rushed off to hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cries and screams rang out as around 100 emergency responders deployed to the litter-strewn market decorated with Christmas trees and festive lights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pictures are terrible," said city spokesman Michael Reif.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deadly carnage recalled a 2016 jihadist attack in which a Tunisian man driving a lorry killed 12 people in a Christmas market in Berlin, the country's worst such attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 13th victim died later having suffered serious injuries in the assault, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X that "the reports from Magdeburg raise the worst fears".
  <br>
  <br>
  "My thoughts are with the victims and their families. We stand by their side and by the side of the people of Magdeburg. My thanks go to the dedicated rescue workers in these anxious hours."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz was expected to travel to the city on Saturday, said the state premier.
  <br>
  <br>
  German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has recently called on people to be vigilant at Christmas markets, although she said that authorities had not received any specific threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The domestic security service had warned it considers Christmas markets to be an "ideologically suitable target for Islamist-motivated people". (AFP)

    Congress passes funding bill with Democrat help

<img alt="US president-elect Donald Trump has made it clear he's willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way on the spending package. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784460_1_20241221090155.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US House of Representatives voted on Friday to avert a government shutdown with just hours to spare, with Democrats joining Republicans to advance a funding bill keeping the lights on through mid-March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers sent a package to the Senate that would keep federal agencies running through mid-March -- but the upper chamber only has until midnight (0500 GMT) to follow suit or federal agencies will begin shutting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the House is run by the Republicans, who introduced the bill, 34 of the party's backbenchers voted against it, while almost every Democrat was a yes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, Democrats stood firm in our commitment to collaboration, not division. The American people deserve a government that works for them," senior Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson posted on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  If senators drag their feet, the government will still cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to a halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic-led upper chamber would be expected to follow the House, however, and the main question now is how quickly senators will move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Congress's setting of government budgets is always a fraught task, with both chambers closely divided between Republicans and Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest drama intensified after Republican President-elect Trump and tech billionaire Musk, his incoming "efficiency czar," pressured his party to renege on a funding bill they had hammered out with Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two subsequent efforts to find compromise fell short, leaving Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson at the last chance saloon as he huddled with aides to keep government agencies running.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the bill fails Senate scrutiny, non-essential government functions will be put on ice. Employees in key services like law enforcement would continue working but would only be paid once government functions are back up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many parks, monuments and national sites would close at a time when millions of visitors are expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The House-passed bill avoids all that by funding the government until mid-March in a package that includes IS$110 billion in disaster aid and financial relief for farmers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is essentially the same as a bill that failed miserably in a vote on Thursday -- except without a two-year suspension of the country's self-imposed borrowing limit demanded by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk appeared again to be doing his best to marshal conservatives against the deal ahead of the House vote, as he posted: "So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?"
  <br>
  <br>
  The influence of the world's richest man over the Republicans -- and his apparent sway with Trump -- has become a focus for Democratic attack, with questions raised over how an unelected citizen can wield so much power.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is growing anger even among Republicans over Musk's interference after he trashed the original funding agreement in a blizzard of posts -- many of them wildly inaccurate -- on his social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last time I checked, Elon Musk doesn't have a vote in Congress," Georgia House Republican Rich McCormick told CNN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, he has influence, and he'll put pressure on us to do whatever he thinks the right thing is for him. But I have 760,000 people that voted for me to do the right thing for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Senate's expected rubber stamp could take days under the rules governing the upper chamber, unless members agree unanimously to waive normal procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has been clear that he is willing to see a shutdown if he does not get his way. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets rebounded on Friday following a pullback in US Treasury yields as markets braced for a looming US government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reading came in lower than expected, prompting a pullback in US Treasury bond yields that had risen after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled earlier this week they expect fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,930.85, up 1.1 percent for the day but down about two percent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 percent to 42,840.26 and the Nasdaq Composite: was up1.0 percent at 19,572.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen a nice rebound from what was, in our view, an overreaction to the Fed's outlook on Wednesday," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones, pointing to Friday's inflation data as a supportive factor for equities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields pulled back following comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, who expressed confidence that the PCE data showed that inflation was returning to the Fed's target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next 12 to 18 months, rates can still go down a fair amount," Goolsbee told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also keeping watch on developments in Capitol Hill.
  <br>
  <br>
  US lawmakers raced to stave off a government shutdown set to bite within hours after Donald Trump and Elon Musk sabotaged a bipartisan agreement that would have averted a shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  If no deal is struck, the government will cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stocks finished the day lower although they cut their losses as Wall Street rebounded, with data showing tepid retail sales in the UK in the runup to Christmas dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Nike dipped 0.2 percent as it reported lower earnings while new CEO Elliott Hill outlined steps to get the slumping sports giant back on track. Analysts pointed to Nike's near-term outlook, which suggests a turnaround will not be quick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carnival jumped 6.4 percent following an upbeat 2025 forecast that included a 20 percent rise in profits to $2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials said they were satisfied with the inaugural concert that was being held at the Kai Tak Arena on Friday, saying it had generally met the government's expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The show was aimed at testing the venue’s readiness for hosting mega events and its possible impact on the surrounding neighbourhood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 5,200 ticket holders attended the Chill Thai Music Festival, which featured local boy band Mirror, girl group Collar and various Thai performers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance kicked off at around 6.50pm -- 20 minutes behind schedule -- and ended at 10.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spectator surnamed Wong said while the acoustic system wasn’t perfect, instructions were clear and staff were helpful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be honest, since it's the first time, there's room for improvement. I'd give it 50 marks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything was clear and plenty of people were helping out. When we went in, people voluntarily helped us check our tickets and find our seats. There were also many signboards, and this place was easy to find."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed to wear Airpods to protect our ears because the music was too loud," another spectator, surnamed Chan, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi -- who attended the test event with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law and Acting Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk -- said authorities were generally happy with how things went.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The show today slightly overran, but we have systems and mechanisms in place to handle such situations, including communication protocols with public transport operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that various audio and visual setups will continue to be fine-tuned to improve overall spectator experience.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose for a second straight month in November according to government data published on Friday, although the increase came in a touch below expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, and 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, headline prices rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was slightly below the median forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, triggering a sharp sell-off in the financial markets.
  <br>

  The independent US central bank is responsible for tackling inflation and unemployment, largely by hiking or lowering interest rates to affect demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This indirectly impacts the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, affecting everything from mortgages to car loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, the core PCE price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and by 0.1 percent from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both figures were slightly below expectations. (AFP)

 Football fans were treated to a nostalgic evening as former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars faced off in a highly anticipated exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game brought together veteran players from the two iconic clubs, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos for Real Madrid, and Thierry Henry and Xavi Hernández for Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s good to see the players,” said football enthusiast Mike.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people that are here are really enjoying themselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Many fans attended the game to watch their favourite players in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benjamin, a French native, was excited to see a legend from his home country grace the field again.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I [used to] only see Thierry Henry on TV,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it was an opportunity to see the legendary player [in person].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid supporter Carlos shared similar sentiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was really nice [to see Luis Figo play in person]. I saw him 10 years ago back in Madrid, and to see him play here is really nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match ended in a one-sided 5-2 victory for Barcelona. But for many of the spectators, being able to witness the historic rivalry was what mattered most.

    Trump threatens tariffs unless EU buys more oil, gas

<img alt="Donald Trump says tariffs will make the United States rich. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784413_1_20241220211049.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump on Friday threatened the European Union with tariffs if the bloc does not reduce its "tremendous" trade gap with Washington through oil and gas purchases.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large-scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform in the early hours of Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!"
  <br>
  <br>
  According to US figures, goods imports from the EU were US$553.3 billion in 2022, while its exports to the bloc were US$350.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  This puts the US goods trade deficit with the EU at US$202.5 billion that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had already suggested to Trump in November that the United States could supply more liquefied natural gas to the bloc to replace Russian energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replying to questions on Trump's threat on Friday, an EU spokesman said the 27-nation bloc was open to talks, noting that the US also enjoyed "a substantial trade in services surplus vis a vis the EU."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector," EU spokesman Olof Gill told a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office in January, has made sweeping threats of slapping tariffs on US trading partners – including Canada, Mexico and China – which could send reverberations across the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing Canada and Mexico of allowing the United States to be flooded with illicit drugs and undocumented migrants, he had threatened a 25-percent import tariff, while vowing at least 10 percent against Chinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the European Union concluded a massive trade deal with four South American countries – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which aims to create a 700-million-customer free-trade area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Von der Leyen had said the agreement would build trade bridges as "strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation" – comments largely seen as a nod to Trump's threats to hike tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts have said Trump's tariff threats could be bluster, or an opening shot for leverage in future trade negotiations when he comes into office.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump has continually insisted that "properly used" tariffs would be positive for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our country right now loses to everybody," he told reporters at his Florida residence earlier this week. "Tariffs will make our country rich." (AFP)

    English Rugby Union chairman quits amid pay row

<img alt="Tom Ilube had been facing calls for his removal after a grassroots revolt. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784410_1_20241220203617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby Football Union chairman Tom Ilube has stepped down amid a row over the scale of the governing body's executive bonuses, saying the issue had become a "distraction."
 <br>
  <br>
  The move on Friday follows an outcry over RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney's paycheck of £1.1 million (US$1.37 million) for the 2023/24 financial year, which included a bonus of £358,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported that Bill Beaumont, who held the role from 2012 to 2016 and in November stepped down as World Rugby chairman, is being lined up to fill the position on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game, but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place," Ilube said in a statement issued by the RFU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RFU, which held an emergency council meeting on Wednesday, has announced an independent review of its executive pay scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube had been facing motions calling for his removal after a grassroots revolt gathered enough support to trigger a special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed," said Ilube's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the game are furious at the amount earned by Sweeney given the RFU reported an operating loss of £37.9 million for the same period, the highest it has ever recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 42 staff were made redundant in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the pitch, the England men's team won just five of their 12 matches in 2024 and grassroots participation is in decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweeney's position is also under threat, with a motion for the RFU board to dismiss him set to be tabled at the forthcoming special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube was head of the remuneration committee that signed off the long-term incentive plan that is the basis for the bonuses awarded to Sweeney and other executives. (AFP)

    Biden cancels US$4.28bn more in student debt

<img alt="President Biden says he had promised to make higher education a ticket to the middle class. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784408_1_20241220203036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday he was cancelling student loans for an additional 55,000 Americans, which would amount to wiping out US$4.28 billion in debt in his final month in office.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mass cancellation of debt is for "teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials, and other public service workers who have dedicated their lives to giving back to their communities," he said in a statement issued by the White House on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this new crop of beneficiaries, it would mean "nearly 5 million people" have been approved for debt relief during Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From Day One of my administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement that Friday's approval brings the total amount secured during Biden's four years in office to "nearly US$180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Democratic president had instigated a landmark forgiveness programme in 2022 to cancel hundreds of billions in student debt – which would have made certain borrowers eligible to receive US$20,000 in cancellations, while the vast majority were eligible for US$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the conservative-dominated Supreme Court overruled the program in 2023, stating that given the large sum, the president had overstepped his powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the United States, colleges can often cost anywhere between US$10,000 and US$70,000 a year, leaving some graduates with crushing debt as they enter the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Pew Research Center, one in four American adults under 40 have student loan debt, with the median amount owed being between US$20,000 and US$25,000 in 2023, varying by education level. (AFP)

    Malaysia to resume search for missing MH370 plane

<img alt="Malaysia agreed to launch a new search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared mysteriously 10 years ago. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784393_1_20241220183504.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia's government has agreed in principle to accept a second “no find, no fee” proposal from a US company to renew the hunt for flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than 10 years ago, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Loke said cabinet ministers gave the nod at their meeting last week for Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to continue the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The proposed new search area, identified by Ocean Infinity, is based on the latest information and data analyses conducted by experts and researchers. The company’s proposal is credible,” he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Satellite data showed the plane deviated from its flight path to head over the southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed.
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said the government will not be required to pay Ocean Infinity unless the plane's wreckage is discovered, under the same “no find, no fee” deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his ministry hopes to finalise negotiations for terms and conditions of the agreement with Ocean Infinity in early 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This decision reflects the government’s commitment to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of MH370 passengers,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity CEO Oliver Punkett earlier this year reportedly said the the company had improved its technology since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and narrow the search area to the most likely site. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 13 million passenger trips in and out of Hong Kong will take place over the Christmas and New Year holidays with the majority via land borders, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Immigration Department said about 11 million trips will likely be made through land boundary control points from Saturday to New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of departures via land is estimated to peak at 595,000 on Christmas Day and the inbound figure is likely to reach a high of 626,000 on December 29, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Border control points at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau and Shenzhen Bay are expected to be busy, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To cope with the anticipated heavy traffic during the festive period, the [Immigration Department] has minimised leave for frontline officers for flexible deployment and operation of extra clearance counters and kiosks," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional security guards will also be deployed to provide crowd management support."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials also said further details will be announced "as soon as possible" regarding government requests to extend the service hours of two border checkpoints on New Year's Eve.

    HA to beef up manpower ahead of winter flu surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Friday said it will beef up manpower and bed capacity to guard against a potential surge in patients during the upcoming holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported a mild increase in both Covid and influenza cases, with the numbers expected to rise further in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it will activate special measures for peak periods from Saturday, including reducing non-urgent hospital admissions and boosting manpower in public hospitals by 10 to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, told a press conference that he's confident public hospitals have enough capacity to cope with a surge in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important bit of it is to increase the bed turnover, including making use of our command centre and the day centre, so that we can aim our patients not lasting too long in our hospitals so that we can cater more emergency admissions," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "According to experience, our measures have improved and enhanced our capability to cope with the increased demand. So if the situations and the service activity will be similar to last year, I think we can cope with it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the HA will also relaunch a special refund arrangement at accident and emergency departments to ease the pressure on services. Patients who don't want to wait any longer to be seen can apply for a refund of the HK$180 fee within 24 hours of registration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP, meanwhile, appealed to high-risk individuals to get flu vaccines to protect themselves.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Macau-based academic on Friday said the SAR should think of ways to bring people to neighbouring Hengqin Island, which is partly leased to the territory, to diversify its economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a speech at the inauguration of the new Macau government, President Xi Jinping urged authorities not to deviate from the purpose of the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area offers support for Macau in diversifying its economy and developing four key industries: big health; innovation and technology; financial services; conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Hengqin] is highly developed, but it still lacks population," City University of Macau's rector Jun Liu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we really think about Hengqin as an expanded area, as a collaboration zone, we need to have people. We need to have policies to support four areas of economic diversification, we need to retain those highly qualified graduates... On the other hand, we really need to look elsewhere for great talent from around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor also said the new government under Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai is expected to take forward measures and initiatives, after the previous administration had laid the groundwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, it seems that we are [in] a better position to move forward with more vision, more hands-on strategies," Liu said.

    Police arrest 39 over 'staged traffic accidents'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty-nine people were arrested this week on suspicion of staging traffic accidents to try to defraud the government out of money granted to injured victims, police said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspects, aged between 19 and 48, are suspected of making false claims worth a total of HK$2 million in relation to 33 allegedly fake accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Earlier this year, an internal audit by the Social Welfare Department found fraudsters using falsified documents to apply for the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Scheme," Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lim said at a press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Police investigations found some of these claims were linked to an organisation which orchestrates staged traffic accidents. One such incident involved 13 people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam noted that 275 people were arrested last month over suspicious claims under the scheme worth a total of HK$14 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police said money was not paid out in relation to most of the suspicious claims connected to the latest arrests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department said it verifies every application stringently and is carrying out more random checks on medical certificates submitted by applicants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If false medical information, fraudulence or other criminal elements are suspected, the SWD will refer the case to the police for investigation and recover the overpaid assistance payments from the relevant applicants," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department also warned that people convicted of providing false information to obtain money from the accident victims scheme risk a jail term of up to 14 years.

    US govt shutdown looms as bill fails in Congress

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spending bill backed by Donald Trump failed in the US House of Representatives on Thursday as dozens of Republicans defied the president-elect, leaving Congress with no clear plan to avert a fast-approaching government shutdown that could disrupt Christmas travel.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vote laid bare fault lines in Trump's Republican Party that could surface again next year when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had pressured lawmakers to tie up loose ends before he takes office on January 20, but members of the party's right flank refused to support a package that would increase spending and clear the way for a plan that would add trillions more to the federal government's US$36 trillion in debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible," said Republican Representative Chip Roy, one of 38 Republicans who voted against the bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package failed by a vote of 174-235 just hours after it was hastily assembled by Republican leaders seeking to comply with Trump's demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world's richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson provided no details when reporters asked him about next steps after the failed vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will come up with another solution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the US government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paychecks for more than two million federal workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Transportation Security Administration warned that travellers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill that failed on Thursday largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would have extended government funding into March and provided US$100 billion in disaster relief and suspended the debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Trump's urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years -- a move that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson before the vote told reporters that the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well," he said. (Reuters)

    Japan inspects US air base over chemical spill

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese authorities on Friday staged an inspection of a US military base in Tokyo, a government spokesman said, after being informed by the American side of a chemical leak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's probe at the Yokota Air Base followed a US notice two months ago that water containing PFOS -- classified by the World Health Organisation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" -- had spilled from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  PFOS is part of a large group of man-made chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called "forever chemicals" because they do not degrade easily, experts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US military informed Tokyo in October that the PFOS-laced water had leaked from an area of the base where a fire-fighting drill was being carried out, Fumitoshi Sato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This inspection was realised in response to the fears and concerns harboured by local residents, and we will continue to work together with the US side," Sato said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials including from the defence ministry and Tokyo's metropolitan government visited the site on Friday, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yokota Air Base was not immediately available for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's military presence in Japan has frequently stoked local discontent in the past, with everything from noise to pollution to helicopter accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  This frustration is perhaps most evident on the southern island of Okinawa, which despite comprising just 0.6 percent of Japan's landmass, hosts the vast majority of the country's US military bases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, the United States began relocating thousands of Marines from Okinawa, with an initial "detachment of approximately 100 logistics support Marines" transferred to the US island territory of Guam. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday directed Macau to diversify its economy as one of his four “hopes” for its new administration, after swearing in the SAR’s new Chief Executive, Sam Hou-fai.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president expressed confidence the SAR will open up new horizons for development and keep creating new glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland, Xi also laid out his expectations for the government to improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China’s connections with the international community, and safeguard social harmony and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president urged the gambling hub to cultivate new industries in alignment with China's national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present the overall situation in Macau is stable, but the internal and external environment is undergoing profound changes," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Efforts should be made to promote moderate economic diversification... [with a] focus on cultivating new industries with international competitiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi also highlighted the importance of Hengqin Island, which was partly leased to Macau to boost its land supply for non-gaming development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government decided to develop Hengqin with the goal of fostering Macau's development of a diversified economy and to facilitate the living and employment of Macau residents," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There can be no development of industries and projects that do not align with this positioning."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the crucial role that the One Country, Two Systems model has played in ensuring the city’s success in the past 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's splendid achievements since its return to the motherland is proof to the world that 'One Country, Two Systems' has a clear systemic advantage and strong vitality," Xi said, adding that the framework "must be adhered to over the long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that young people in the city should continue to build on the successes of One Country, Two Systems, and urged authorities to help nurture the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The SAR government and all sectors in society should care more about them and help them develop, and create a better environment and conditions for them,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope all young people will care about Macau and the country, set lofty goals, be pragmatic, and fulfil the role of builders and successors of the cause of One Country Two Systems.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Macau has been shining like a “bright pearl” and that its people have benefitted from its economic and social development over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sense of gain, happiness and security of Macau residents have strengthened significantly,” Xi said. (Additional reporting by agencies)

    Smart system to take effect at Ting Kau Bridge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department on Friday said it will implement a smart highway system at Ting Kau Bridge by the end of this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the system has the ability to detect traffic accidents, and make appropriate arrangements to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Assistant Commissioner for Transport (Strategic Studies) Leung Sai-ho said the Automatic Incident Detection System can notify staff at the Tsing Ma Control Area in 10 seconds if it notices any abnormalities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In cases in which a car suddenly stops moving, or slows down, or drives in the opposite direction, or objects fall on to the road, the system can analyse footage and deduce that a traffic incident has happened and tell our staff to act," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we do not have such systems, we will have to detect incidents through the human eye, which would take minutes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said on-site staff may open up the hard shoulder of Ting Kau Bridge southbound to ease traffic flow, along with lane control signals and variable message signs to allow vehicles to pass by.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added message boards have already been installed along the road, aiming to provide real-time information to drivers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system will be in place on December 29 for a one-month trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said a mid-term review would be conducted in around six months if the scheme runs smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the department would analyse traffic data collected and fine tune its implementation of the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wesley Wan, honorary life president of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, told RTHK that the city's drivers are familiar with having variable message boards on highways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [drivers] are already used to the notice board and the electronic notice on the highway. But I've noticed many times the government puts on some road safety message instead of the road information on the spot. They should inform motorists of the real-time information on the highway instead of just a road safety message," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wan also said the one-month trial period may be too short for data to be collected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the government] spent a lot of time to install the system for this trial. So my question is, why just a one month trial? If we are lucky that there's no accident happening during this month, then we'll have no data. So I think the trial, with all this preparation work, the trial should be longer," he said.

    Wolves appoint Vitor Pereira as new head coach

<img alt="Vitor Pereira at a match between Brazilian side Corinthians and São Paulo. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784283_2_20241220075103.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wolverhampton Wanderers announced Thursday they had appointed Vitor Pereira as their new head coach as they battle for Premier League survival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old Portuguese manager has left Saudi Pro League club Al Shabab to join Wolves on an 18-month contract after the Midlands side, battling to avoid relegation, sacked Gary O'Neil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely travelled Pereira was close to replacing Rafael Benitez as Everton manager in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an extensive managerial career, Pereira has won two Primeira Liga titles with Porto and the Greek Super League with Olympiakos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported Tuesday that Wolves would pay around US$1 million to bring Pereira to the English top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to welcome Vitor Pereira to Wolves as the new head coach of our men's first-team," Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Vitor is a highly respected and experienced coach who has achieved success across different leagues, and will bring a new approach for the test ahead," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a challenging moment for the club, and we want to thank Vitor for taking on this responsibility. We have full confidence in his ability to guide us back on track, alongside the players and staff, and the entire club will be united in supporting him to achieve success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves, second bottom in the Premier League, said Pereira took his first training session with the club on Thursday and would be in charge for their match away to fellow relegation candidates Leicester – five points above them in the standings – on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was sacked after Saturday's 2-1 loss at home to Ipswich, the club's fourth defeat in a row, left Wolves with just nine points from 16 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was appointed in August 2023, following the departure of Julen Lopetegui and signed a new four-year deal with the club in August this year. (AFP)

    US-based Friedkin Group completes Everton takeover

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US-based Friedkin Group has completed the takeover of Premier League strugglers Everton, ending a turbulent period for the club under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri.
 <br>
  <br>
  Everton have been acquired by Roundhouse Capital Holdings Limited, an entity within the Friedkin Group (TFG), the club announced on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League said TFG had purchased a 98.8 percent stake in Everton, which becomes the 10th English top-flight club under majority American ownership – a list that includes Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in September that TFG had agreed to buy Moshiri's majority stake subject to regulatory approval, which has now been granted by the Premier League, Women's Professional Leagues Limited, the Football Association and the Financial Conduct Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported that TFG's deal to buy Everton was worth more than US$500 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Texas-based group is led by chairman Dan Friedkin and also owns Italian Serie A club Roma. Friedkin has a net worth of US$7.7 billion, according to Forbes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take immense pride in welcoming one of England's most historic football clubs to our global family, the Friedkin Group," Friedkin said in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming executive chairman Marc Watts said "providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority".
  <br>
  <br>
  "While restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Iranian businessman Moshiri, who bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016, welcomed the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I truly believe that the transaction with the Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  American investment firm 777 Partners were unable to complete a deal earlier this year while John Textor, who has a share in Crystal Palace, had previously been in the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have twice been sanctioned under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules in the past 13 months, and had eight points in total deducted last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club have been ever present in the English top flight for the past 70 years but have flirted with relegation in recent seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are currently 16th in the Premier League table, just three points above the relegation zone.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Thursday as Treasury bond yields climbed further in the wake of a Federal Reserve decision that prompted deep selling in the prior session.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices bounced early in the day, but the rebound faded as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates but signaled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 percent to 42,342.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,867.08, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.1 percent to 19,372.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's move in stocks is "kind of a lacklustre recovery effort," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of good news has been priced into this market," he said. "And now the market is going to sit back and see if a lot of that good news that's priced in actually comes to fruition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were monitoring Capitol Hill where an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump on a spending bill raised the possibility of a government shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Micron Technology sank 16.2 percent after projecting earnings that lagged estimates. While the chip company benefited from strong demand for artificial intelligence, analysts pointed to a drag from weak demand for personal computers and automobile clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden and other chains, jumped 14.7 percent after projecting a 1.5 percent rise in same-restaurant sales for its full fiscal year. (AFP)

    Putin: Russia closer to achieving goals in Ukraine

<img alt="During his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield in Ukraine, and touted what he said was the invincibility of Russia's new hypersonic missile.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, Putin said Moscow's forces were advancing along the whole of the battle front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I must say that the situation is changing dramatically... There is movement along the entire front line. Every day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Western and Russian military analysts say Russia is advancing in eastern Ukraine at the fastest pace since 2022, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our fighters are reclaiming territory by the square kilometre every day," Putin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the fighting was complex, so it was "difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is fighting, literally heroically. And they are fighting right now. Let us wish them all...good luck, victory and to return home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv's troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the "Oreshnik" hypersonic missile which Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is no chance of shooting down these missiles," said Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let Western experts propose to us, and let them propose to those in the West and the U.S. who pay them for their analysis, to conduct some kind of technological experiment, say, a high-tech duel of the 21st century.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?" he said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called on Macau to better integrate into the country's strategic development and continue to strive for more, saying the SAR has what it takes to "fly high".
 <br>
  <br>
  Stating his three expectations on Thursday, the president urged the city to align with the motherland's developments; to gather people who safeguard One Country, Two Systems and love Macau; and to undergo reforms and innovate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Macau] must keep an eye on the overall strategies of the rejuvenation of the Chinese civilisation and changes in the world," Xi addressed a dinner reception celebrating the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should keep up with the trend of the times, further find its own positioning, plan for the future development of Macau, be more proactive in aligning with national development strategies such as the Greater Bay Area, and make greater achievements on the international stage," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president praised the outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and his administration, saying the past five years had been "extraordinary" in the city's history, navigating constant changes in the world and challenges presented by the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support of the central government and the motherland, Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and the fifth-term government have united and led all sectors of Macau to overcome difficulties, and to be pragmatic," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They] have promoted the continued improvement of the economy, with various undertakings making comprehensive progress and writing a new chapter in the successful implementation of One Country, Two Systems with Macau characteristics."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, for his part, told the crowd that his administration had implemented the principle of "patriots governing Macau", safeguarded national security, promoted moderate economic diversification, improved governance, and better integrated into the nation's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The motherland is the strongest backing for Macau's prosperity and stability. The country has always regarded Macau as its 'crown jewel', cared about the well-being of compatriots, continued to introduce a series of policies and measures beneficial to Macau, and constantly provided new opportunities, space and motivation for Macau's development," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Xi and the central government for their trust and support, while giving his backing for his successor Sam Hou-fai in leading the new government and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president and the guests were then treated to a gala show featuring musical performances, dances, acrobatics among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The congregation joined Xi in singing "Ode to the Motherland", wrapping up the hour-long event on a high note.

    Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband found guilty in rape trial

<img alt="Gisèle Pelicot at the courthouse to hear the verdict in the trial of her ex-husband, with 50 others, who were found guilty of drugging her and orchestrating multiple rapes over nearly a decade. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784212_1_20241219171348.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A French court on Thursday sentenced Gisèle Pelicot's ex-husband to the maximum term of 20 years jail for committing and orchestrating the mass rapes targeting her with dozens of strangers he recruited online.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot, who had already confessed to the crimes, was earlier found guilty by the court in the southern city of Avignon after a more than three-month trial that shocked France.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including Dominique Pelicot, all 51 defendants in the case were convicted by the court with no acquittals.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 50 co-defendants received jail terms of between three and 15 years -- less than what prosecutors had demanded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of these defendants had their jail terms suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pelicot, the now ex-husband of the 72-year-old grandmother, admitted that for years he knocked his wife of 50 years out with drugs so he and strangers he recruited online could abuse and rape her while he filmed the assaults.
  <br>
  <br>
  The appalling ordeal inflicted over nearly a decade on Gisèle Pelicot, in what she thought was a loving marriage, and her courage during the bruising and stunning trial have transformed the retired power company worker into a feminist hero of the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stretching over more than three months, the trial galvanised campaigners against sexual violence and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had arrested 22 people and seized drugs worth over HK$160 million in a series of airport operations ahead of the Christmas holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said around 370 kilos of drugs were seized from November to mid-December, including ketamine, methamphetamine and space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffickers made use of festive decorations to hide the drugs before the holiday season, officers added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the long holiday season at year-end, drug traffickers usually take the opportunity to smuggle drugs to the local market," said Wong Ngar-shan, acting divisional commander of Customs' airport investigation group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, Hong Kong Customs has adjusted its enforcement strategies accordingly, successfully intercepting cannabis from North America and Thailand, ketamine from Europe, and methamphetamine from North America from entering the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also said they seized 18 kilos of etomidate powder shipped from India, which can be used to make around 54,000 space oil-infused capsules.
  <br>
  <br>
  Often inhaled through vapes, space oil usually contains etomidate, a regulated sedative that is prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government wants to add etomidate to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance by the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTR passengers will get the chance to travel on panda-themed trains from Thursday, as part of a wider campaign to welcome the city’s four new pandas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The corporation is one of the many businesses joining the “Come and Enjoy a Pandastic Hong Kong” campaign, organised by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Hong Kong Tourism Board and Ocean Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two trains on the South Island Line and one Airport Express train have been decorated with pandas and will commence service on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  “December is the month of the pandas. If we read the news in the last few days we see there’s a lot of new attractions rolled out to celebrate or to share the joy of the pandas with the public,” MTR managing director Jeny Yeung told a media briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So MTR is also launching a series of activities and decorations in our trains so that when our passengers are going to different destinations including when they are visiting the pandas they can have a very joyful experience,” she said
  <br>
  <br>
  People will also be able to see panda decorations at Ocean Park Station and at Admiralty Station, where LED pillars with 3D animations of a giant panda waving its arms will also greet passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Lo Wu Station, Lok Ma Chau Station, West Kowloon Station, as well as stations along the South Island Line and Airport Express, MTR staff will be attaching panda plushies to their uniforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The campaign will run until mid-February.

 French President Emmanuel Macron arrived Thursday to the Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte to survey the devastation wreaked by Cyclone Chido.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcon will overfly the area for an aerial appraisal of the damage before visiting the hospital. He will then visit a destroyed neighborhood.

  French authorities said at least 31 people have died and more than 1,500 people were injured, more than 200 critically.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it's feared hundreds or even thousands of people have died after the strongest cyclone in nearly a century ripped through the French territory on Saturday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A series of intense Israeli airstrikes shook Yemen's rebel-held capital and a port city early on Thursday and killed at least nine people, officials said, shortly after a Houthi missile targeted central Israel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s strikes risk further escalating conflict with the Iranian-backed Houthis, whose attacks on the Red Sea corridor have drastically impacted global shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebels have so far avoided the same level of intense military strikes that have targeted Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran, which backs the group, denounced the raids as a "flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and the UN Charter."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's raids came after it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have regularly targeted Israel over its military operation in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military said it "conducted precise strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen -- including ports and energy infrastructure in Sanaa, which the Houthis have been using in ways that effectively contributed to their military actions."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I warn the leaders of the Houthi terrorist organisation: Israel's long arm will reach you too," Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al-Masira, a media channel belonging to the Houthis, said a series of "aggressive raids" were launched in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa and the port city of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  It reported raids that "targeted two central power plants" in and around Yemen's capital Sanaa, while in Hodeidah it said "the enemy launched four aggressive raids targeting the port... and two raids targeting" an oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said strikes on the Al-Saleef port had killed seven people, while two more were killed and other injured in the strike on the oil facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strikes came after Israel's military intercepted a missile from Yemen for the second time this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Houthis claimed a missile launch they said was aimed at "a military target of the Israeli enemy in the occupied area of Yaffa" -- a reference to Israel's Tel Aviv area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also Monday, an Israeli navy missile boat intercepted a drone in the Mediterranean after it was launched from Yemen, the military said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have said they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians and pledged Monday to continue operations "until the aggression on Gaza stops and the siege is lifted".
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 9, a drone claimed by Houthis exploded on the top floor of a residential building in the central Israel city of Yavne, causing no casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a Houthi drone attack in Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting retaliatory strikes on the Yemeni port of Hodeidah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Houthis have also regularly targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, leading to retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets by United States and sometimes British forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the group had become a "global threat," pointing to Iran's support for the rebels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to act against anyone, anyone in the Middle East, that threatens the state of Israel," he said. (Agencies)

<img alt='A survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service found that around nine percent of respondents reported the use of "space oil". Photo: RTHK' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784169_1_20241219134307.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A recent survey by the Hong Kong Christian Service has found that half of drug users wait years before seeking help, and many downplay the negative effects of drug abuse.
 <br>
  <br>
  The organisation polled 304 drug users between September and November, and found that 55 percent only sought treatment after using drugs for more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 40 percent claimed that drug use had no negative impact on their lives, and the youngest drug abuser was just nine years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Ng, the group’s service supervisor, said people might be reluctant to seek help because of the stigma associated with drug use.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Sometimes it's a health issue. They cannot find any health issue in their body, or maybe they were not aware of the mental illness issue. The second point is they don't want to [publicly tell] their story,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also found that around nine percent of respondents reported using "space oil" - a regulated sedative typically inhaled through vapes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Psychiatrist Dr Matthew Wong said long-term use of space oil could cause irreversible damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When someone is using the drug repeatedly and also receiving a high dose, that will cause damage in the brain cells and also cause some irreversible chemical imbalance in the brain,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will bring all sorts of physical and mental problems the patient would be suffering from.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The group called for more prevention education in schools and more accessible support channels to help people tackle drug addiction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping visited the Macau University of Science and Technology on Thursday morning on the second day of his trip marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi’s motorcade arrived at the university before 10am amid tight security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president toured two state-level laboratories at the university, one in traditional Chinese medicine and the other in lunar and planetary science.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had exchanges with faculty, researchers and students, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  University president Joseph Lee quoted Xi as saying Macau could work with the mainland in areas such as Chinese medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xi] believes the research for Chinese medicine should be combined with the latest biomedicine to lead the world, and that Chinese medicine will take up a very important position in the world," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the president noted the achievements of the Macau Science 1, a low-latitude satellite constellation with high-precision geomagnetic field measurements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong Chi-meng, Macau's director of education and youth development, said Xi was satisfied with the development of higher education in the SAR and praised the territory's patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi had warm exchanges with residents living and starting businesses in the cooperation zone, and with people involved in the zone's planning, construction, management and services, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is expected to visit other places in Macau this afternoon and attend a gala dinner and a variety show in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday morning, a museum near the Ruínas de São Paulo welcomed First Lady Peng Liyuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng spent around an hour at the museum and met a group of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Peng] urged the kids to study history and culture well, so that they could better understand their own place and offer help in the future," said Macau's culture chief Leong Wai-man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will lead a delegation to Macau to attend the celebration events today.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan and Justice Secretary Paul Lam will be among those joining Lee on the visit.

    Arson suspected in deadly karaoke fire in Hanoi

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire ripped through a karaoke bar in the Vietnamese capital, killing 11 people and injuring two others in a case of suspected arson, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pictures on state media showed the blackened multi-storey building in western Hanoi, mostly destroyed by flames, and piles of twisted metal strewn nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received reports of a fire at 11pm on Wednesday "with many people trapped inside".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers rushed to the scene and managed to bring out seven people alive, two of whom were rushed to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven others were found dead, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police suspect that the cafe was (deliberately) burned down and... have arrested the perpetrator," Hanoi police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told state media the fire was so large that no one dared to attempt to rescue those trapped inside. Photos from the scene showed that the building's balconies were enclosed with metal bars, likely making escape difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nguyen Minh Hung, who was nearby at the time, told the Dan Tri newspaper: "We were shouting for the trapped victims, but we heard no ask for help from inside the building."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 fire trucks and ambulances sped to the scene, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire reportedly began on the first floor, before quickly spreading through the building. State media said CCTV footage from a nearby house showed a man carrying a bucket entering the premises shortly before the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspect was arrested around midnight, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had gone to the karaoke bar to drink beer before arguing with staff, they added. He then allegedly bought petrol and poured it close to an area with many motorbikes, which burst into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident comes after six people, including four police officers, were jailed in October over a fire that ripped through a karaoke bar two years ago, killing 32 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze in a province close to business hub Ho Chi Minh City shocked Vietnam and led to the closure of thousands of karaoke bars nationwide for failing to meet fire regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the country's approximately 15,000 karaoke bars were forced to close, according to state media, citing police sources. (AFP)

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Mayotte on Thursday, his office said, as officials warned the death toll from the most destructive cyclone in living memory could reach hundreds - possibly thousands.
 <br>
  <br>
  France has declared "exceptional natural disaster" measures for Mayotte as authorities grapple with the full scale of the devastation wrought by Cyclone Chido on the Indian Ocean archipelago, racing against time to search for survivors and supply aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" measures, announced by French overseas minister Francois-Noel Buffet on social media platform X, will ensure "faster and more effective management of the crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers raced on Wednesday to find survivors in the ruins of shanty towns while also unblocking roads and clearing rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulldozers were clearing the heliport of the island's only hospital, as residents were busy repairing their metal-sheet huts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Located near Madagascar off the coast of southeastern Africa, Mayotte is France's poorest region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A preliminary toll from France's interior ministry shows that 31 people have been confirmed killed, 45 seriously wounded and 1,373 suffering lighter injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials say the toll could rise exponentially. (AFP)

    US Supreme Court agrees to hear TikTok's appeal

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton, while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rare goals from Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Núñez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Núñez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliott doubled Liverpool in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game, after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN envoy to Syria called on Wednesday for "free and fair" elections after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad, voicing hope for a political solution for Kurdish-held areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria following a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), more than 13 years after his crackdown on democracy protests precipitated one of the deadliest wars of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  He left behind a country scarred by decades of torture, disappearances and summary executions, and the collapse of his rule on December 8 stunned the world and sparked celebrations around Syria and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of civil war have also left the country heavily dependent on aid, deeply fragmented and desperate for justice and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing reporters in Damascus, UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said "there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new Syria that... will adopt a new constitution... and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes, after a transitional period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling for immediate humanitarian assistance, he also said he hoped to see an end to international sanctions levied against Syria over Assad's abuses. (AFP)

    Pérez, Red Bull part ways after season of struggles

<img alt="Red Bull's Sergio Pérez at the qualifying session of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784099_1_20241219064142.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull announced Wednesday that under-pressure Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has departed the Formula One outfit after four seasons, with Liam Lawson tipped to become world champion Max Verstappen's new teammate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pérez, 34, joined Red Bull in 2021 and helped the team earn two constructors' titles and completed a drivers' standings one-two with four-time world champion Verstappen in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won five Grands Prix over 90 starts in Red Bull colours, including a victory at the Monaco GP and a double in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 season, Pérez and Red Bull signed a contract extension, tying the pair together until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Guadalajara-native's form dropped drastically after that deal and he picked up just nine points from his final eight race weekends.
  <br>
  <br>
  This dip in form led to rumours about his future in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came eighth in the drivers' standings as Red Bull surrendered their team title to McLaren with a third-placed finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pérez was adamant during his difficult period that he would stay with the team for next season but he will now part ways with Red Bull with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Pérez said. "Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together."
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran will not have a seat on the grid next season, but it remains to be seen whether he will sign a deal elsewhere for 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We'll meet again soon. And remember – never give up," Pérez added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen hailed his former teammate on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an absolute pleasure driving alongside you", the Dutchman wrote. "We've had some amazing moments together that I'll always remember. Thank you, Checo [Pérez]!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull said that "announcements regarding the team's full 2025 line-up will be made in due course".
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealander Lawson, who currently drives for Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls, is considered the favourite to replace Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old has earned three top-10 finishes so far in his fledgling F1 career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank Checo for all he has done for Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first 1-2 finish in the drivers' championship," the statement went on to read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo." (AFP)

    Real Madrid sink Pachuca to claim Intercontinental Cup

<img alt="Real Madrid on the pitch after winning the Intercontinental Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784093_1_20241219053405.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  France striker Mbappé returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the Fifa Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for Concacaf Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vázquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is Madrid's second title of the season following their Uefa Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Muñoz for the most in club history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased, very happy. It's a success – that's more than anyone else," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the first edition of the Fifa-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year. They will return to the Middle East in early January for the four-team Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble as Fed eyes fewer 2025 rate cuts

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive after the Federal Reserve indicated fewer rate cuts next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784092_1_20241219053202.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates but also slashed the number of 2025 rate cuts in its forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly lower after the Fed projected just two interest rate cuts next year, down from four.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow slid 2.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, to 42,326.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 3.0 percent to 5,872, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.6 percent to 19,392.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seeing the kind of decline we are experiencing right now indicates that the Fed took the market quite by surprise," said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although stocks often enjoy a late-year bounce referred to as the "Santa Claus rally," Stovall said the depth of Wednesday's drop could spur more selling if traders take profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe Santa is already on vacation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank, as expected, moved ahead with a decision to reduce interest rates by a quarter point as Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered an upbeat appraisal of the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the announcement was coupled with the altered outlook on 2025 monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the latest interest rate cut, the Fed is now "significantly closer" to the point where no further cuts will be needed, said Powell, who emphasised the central bank still views two percent inflation as a critical long-term priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's reaction suggests the investors are "grappling" with the likelihood that interest rates "for all intents and purposes, are going to remain higher for longer," said Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's losses were broad-based with 29 of 30 companies in the Dow ending lower and all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finishing in the red. (AFP)

    CATL co-develops EV models with swappable batteries

<img alt="The hope is that the choco-swap battery swapping stations will use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784064_1_20241218212714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CATL said on Wednesday it had co-developed 10 new electric vehicle models with automakers that use swappable batteries, as the Chinese battery giant seeks to lead a trend it says will replace a third of petrol stations in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yang Jun, CEO of CATL's battery swapping brand Evogo, said it would roll out the first EV that uses its so-called "choco-swap" battery this month, with the remaining to be launched in upcoming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL will also look to build 1,000 battery swapping stations next year and to accelerate this further by enlisting partners to build more stations, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's largest battery maker has also been seeking to expand in new business sectors such as micro power grids and skateboard chassis, CATL's chairman Robin Zeng told Reuters in an interview in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the Evogo battery swap service in 2022, which it said would allow drivers to change EV batteries in one minute. Its automaker partners include state-owned Changan Auto and FAW and to date it has built a small number of charging stations across a few Chinese cities on a trial basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription fee for the choco-swap battery swapping service starts from 369 yuan (US$51) per month, Yang said at an event in China's southern city of Xiamen to talk about battery swapping. Zeng told the same event that the batteries would come with two standard sizes to speed up adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope, Zeng added, was that the choco-swap battery swapping stations would use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  China could eventually have 30,000-40,000 battery swapping stations which could replace a third of its roughly 100,000 petrol stations, Yang predicted. Zeng said that he expected battery swapping to make up a third of power-up solutions for EVs alongside home and public chargers by 2030. (Reuters)

<img alt="This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784091_1_20241219051243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, amid uncertainty about inflation and President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers voted 11-to-1 to lower the US central bank's key lending rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In updated economic forecasts, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee pencilled in just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of four, and hiked their inflation outlook for next year, from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed has made progress in tackling inflation through interest rate hikes in the last two years, and recently began paring back rates to boost demand in the economy and support the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent, and raising concerns that the US central bank's battle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump, whose economic proposals include tariff hikes and the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  These plans, combined with the recent uptick in inflation data, led some analysts to pare back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 ahead of Wednesday's meeting, predicting that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer. (AFP)

 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.
