<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea test-fired its latest anti-aircraft missile system in a drill watched by leader Kim Jong-un, state media reported on Friday, as the nuclear-armed state lashed out at US-South Korea joint drills.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch proved the system's "combat fast response," the Korean Central News Agency said, and came a day after South Korea wrapped up a major annual joint military exercise with the United States, known as Freedom Shield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim praised the latest anti-aircraft system, saying North Korea's army would be "equipped with another major defence weapon system with laudable combat performance," the news agency wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not specify where the test took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul said last week the North fired "multiple unidentified ballistic missiles" after it began the joint drills involving US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement on Thursday, an official for the North's defence ministry denounced the military exercise as "no more than a rehearsal of war of aggression."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pyongyang also carried out a test-launch of strategic cruise missiles in the Yellow Sea in late February, which it said showed off "counterattack capabilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent Freedom Shield exercise featured a collaborative drill focused on countering weapons of mass destruction, specifically targeting nuclear, chemical, biological, and radioactive threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have said that more than 10,000 soldiers from the reclusive North were sent to Russia last year to help it fight a shock Ukrainian offensive into the Kursk border region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's spy agency said last month that the North has sent more soldiers to Russia and re-deployed several to the frontline in Kursk.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by Seoul's defence ministry said the North was "continuing to provide weapons, ammunition and other military support to Russia following its troop deployment in the Ukraine war". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third seed Coco Gauff crushed fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-0 6-0 at the Miami Open, the former U.S. Open champion producing a flawless display to reach the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, aiming to win her maiden Miami title, won 84 percent of her first-serve points, saved the one break point she faced and converted six of her nine break points in the 47-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely playing well today, and maybe she wasn't playing her peak great tennis," Gauff said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think anyone who is playing their best tennis will have that scoreline today, so I'm not going to sit here and say she played her best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Gauff, who was eliminated in the round of 16 at Indian Wells last week, will be Ashlyn Krueger who stunned seventh seed Elena Rybakina 6-4 2-6 6-4 for the first top-10 win of her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed and two-times Grand Slam champion Aryna Sabalenka, playing her first match since losing to Mirra Andreeva in the Indian Wells final, broke Bulgarian Viktoriya Tomova six times en route to a 6-3 6-0 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will face qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the third round after the Bulgarian advanced with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Polish 29th seed Magdalena Frech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen also advanced, and Canada's Leylah Fernandez beat American Alycia Parks 7-6(1) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naomi Osaka beat 24th seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-2 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the men's side, Reilly Opelka earned his first ATP Masters 1000 win since 2022 with a 6-3 7-6(4) triumph over American wild card Christopher Eubanks and will face Indian Wells finalist Holger Rune in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's Bu Yunchaokete beat Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-2 without facing a break point and qualifiers Jacob Fearnley and Thiago Agustin Tirante also advanced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former finalist Kei Nishikori withdrew from his Miami opener after reaching the semi-finals of an ATP Challenger Tour event last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season," Nishikori said. (Reuters)

<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris arrives in Shanghai atop the drivers’ standings for the first time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796732_1_20250321100549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren’s dominance, Lewis Hamilton’s bid to bounce back after a disappointing debut for Ferrari, and the passing of Eddie Jordan have generated headlines as Formula 1 prepares for its first "Sprint weekend" of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lando Norris arrived in Shanghai on top of the drivers’ standings for the first time following his win at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix last Sunday, but it was his qualifying pace for McLaren – and not just holding off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen – that had his rivals on edge ahead of practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes driver George Russell went so far as to say McLaren could win every race this season, describing its raw pace advantage as “bigger than Red Bull has ever had”.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, while Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri strongly refuted the claim — stating the form would change between rounds – the rest of the paddock wasn’t so sure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They're definitely ahead,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The gap in qualifying, the gap that there was in Australia is more or less what there is."
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we are around Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of lap times if we put everything together," Leclerc said, "so there’s still a big chunk to get McLaren then.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For seven-time world champion Hamilton, meanwhile, China is a chance for a reset after a difficult Ferrari debut at Melbourne’s Albert Park last weekend, where he qualified eighth, briefly took the lead, but couldn’t hold onto it because of the team's tire strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 40-year-old, who is F1's most successful driver with a record 105 GP wins and 104 pole positions, says he still needs more time to bring the full force of his experience to his new team.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As I get more comfortable and more knowledgeable about the car, I can start making more decisions,” Hamilton said of his preferred set up. “I’m having those discussions, and I’m going to lean a little bit more with adding my experience hopefully a bit more in it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton is hopeful that the Australian GP was an outlier for him and for Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope so,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think our car looked pretty decent in Australia and even on Saturday morning. So, I think it’s a bit of a one-off.” (AP)

<img alt="Ronen Bar says his sacking is intended to 'prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7' attack. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796737_1_20250321102045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency, was sacked on Friday, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he no longer trusts him, and fallout from a report on the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The government unanimously approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to end ISA Director Ronen Bar's term of office," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will leave his post when his successor is appointed or by April 10 at the latest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu on Sunday cited an "ongoing lack of trust" as the reason for moving to dismiss Bar, who joined the agency in 1993.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar, meant to end his tenure next year, was appointed Shin Bet chief in October 2021 by the previous Israeli government that briefly forced Netanyahu from power between June 2021 and December 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  His relations with Netanyahu were strained even before the unprecedented October Hamas attack which sparked the war in Gaza, notably over proposed judicial reforms that had split the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations worsened after the March 4 release of the internal Shin Bet report on the Hamas attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  It acknowledged the agency's own failure in preventing the attack, but also said "a policy of quiet had enabled Hamas to undergo massive military buildup".
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar had already hinted that he would resign before the end of his term, taking responsibility for his agency's failure to prevent the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal provoked the anger of the opposition and led to demonstrations accusing Netanyahu of threatening democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several thousand people braved bad weather late on Thursday to demonstrate outside Netanyahu's private residence in Jerusalem and then the Israeli parliament, where ministers were meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a letter made public on Thursday, Bar said Netanyahu's arguments were "general, unsubstantiated accusations that seem to hide the motivations behind the decision to terminate [his] duties".
  <br>
  <br>
  He wrote the real motives were based on "personal interest" and intended to "prevent investigations into the events leading up to October 7 and other serious matters" being looked at by the Shin Bet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He referred to the "complex, wide-ranging and highly sensitive investigation" involving people close to Netanyahu who allegedly received money from Qatar, a case dubbed "Qatargate" by the media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bar's dismissal comes after the Israeli army launched a series of massive and deadly bombardments on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, following a two-month truce and "targeted" ground operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netanyahu said the operations were intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the 58 hostages remaining in the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In rare criticism of Netanyahu, Israeli President Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that he was worried the resumption of strikes in a time of crisis could undermine "national resilience." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Saudi Arabia in a Fifa 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday, leaving it struggling at the bottom of Group C in the Asian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decisive moment came five minutes into the second half when Saudi midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari scored from close range, capitalising on a rebound after Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei blocked an initial shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's task became even more challenging just before the break when Lin Liangming was shown a red card for a reckless kick to the face of Saudi defender Hassan Kadish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident resulted in a lengthy stoppage as Kadish received treatment before being carried off the field on a stretcher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite dominating possession, the hosts were unable to convert their chances, with a first-half goal by Faisel Al-Ghamdi ruled out by video footage for handball, further compounding their frustrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  After seven matches, China remains at the bottom of Group C with just six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will next take on Australia at home on Tuesday and will look to turn their fortunes around. (Xinhua)

    'Coalition of willing' to meet next week on Ukraine

<img alt="French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new meeting after a European Union summit in Brussels. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796727_1_20250321094059.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron said leaders of the coalition backing Ukraine would meet again next week, hoping to finalise plans to secure a potential truce in the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The huddle in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be the latest in a series of high-stakes gatherings and will come after Kyiv and Moscow hold talks in Saudi Arabia with the United States on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron's announcement on Thursday came after London played host to the latest discussions of military top brass from the so-called "coalition of the willing" around Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said plans on policing a possible ceasefire were "coming together" as US President Donald Trump forges ahead with Russia on ending its war on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron - who along with Starmer has said he is willing to deploy troops to Ukraine - said the meeting next Thursday will be a chance to "fine-tune" work on ensuring any truce is durable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zelensky told an EU summit that "nothing had changed" as Moscow has kept up bombardments despite agreeing with Trump to halt strikes on Ukraine's energy system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said Russian President Vladimir Putin must "stop making unnecessary demands that only prolong the war", calling on the EU to ramp up arms deliveries and keep sanctions in force.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU leaders vowed in a joint declaration, which was agreed without the support of Russia-friendly Hungary, to step up military support despite Moscow's demands for foreign support to stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they stopped short of endorsing a request from Zelensky to give Kyiv US$5.4 billion for artillery shells, in the face of opposition from France and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Norway, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US officials would meet in Saudi Arabia on Monday to build on US-led efforts to secure an end to the war with Russian, now grinding into its fourth year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin had earlier confirmed Russian officials would also hold talks with the US side in Saudi Arabia on the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky and Putin both held talks with Trump this week, and have indicated they are prepared to halt attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days. (AFP)

 All 19 of the world's glacier regions experienced a net loss of mass in 2024 for the third consecutive year, the United Nations said on Friday, warning that saving the planet's glaciers was now a matter of "survival".
 <br>
  <br>
  Five of the last six years have seen the most rapid glacier retreat on record, the UN's World Meteorological Organization weather, climate and water agency said, on the inaugural World Day for Glaciers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Preservation of glaciers is not just an environmental, economic and societal necessity: it's a matter of survival," said WMO chief Celeste Saulo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the continental ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, more than 275,000 glaciers worldwide cover approximately 700,000 square kilometres, said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are rapidly shrinking due to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 hydrological year marked the third year in a row in which all 19 glacier regions experienced a net mass loss," the WMO added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together, they lost 450 billion tonnes of mass, the agency said, citing new data from the Swiss-based World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fourth worst year on record, with the worst being in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  At current rates of melting, many glaciers in western Canada and the United States, Scandinavia, central Europe, the Caucasus, and New Zealand "will not survive the 21st century", said the WMO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agency said that together with ice sheets, glaciers store around 70 percent of the world's freshwater resources, with high mountain regions acting like the world's water towers.
  <br>
  <br>
  If they disappear, that would threaten water supplies for millions of people downstream. (AFP)

    China calls for protections for students in US

<img alt="Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged the US not to impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796721_1_20250321092239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the US after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their students, citing national security concerns.
 <br>
  <br>
  A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the US and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is in the interest of both parties," Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. "We urge the US to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described America’s student visa system as a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to the country's top research institutions and posing a direct threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrolments at your university.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in US schools. (AP)

    Trump moves to shut down Department of Education

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, a decades-old goal of the American right, which wants individual states to run schools free from the influence of federal government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Surrounded by schoolchildren sitting at desks set up in the East Room of the White House, Trump smiled as held up the order after signing it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the order would "begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress, but Trump's order will likely have the power to starve it of funds and staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is one of the most drastic steps yet in the brutal overhaul of the government that Trump is carrying out with the help of tech tycoon Elon Musk and his Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  Democrats and educators have slammed the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, called it a "tyrannical power grab" and "one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has cast the move as necessary to save money and improve educational standards in the United States, saying they are lagging behind those in Europe and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But education has been a battleground for decades in America's culture wars, and Republicans have long wanted to remove control of it from the federal government. (AFP)

    Perisic stars as Croatia stun France in Nations League

<img alt="Croatia's Ivan Perisic celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against France. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796706_1_20250321061557.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ivan Perisic scored one goal and made another as Croatia beat France 2-0 to seize the upper hand in the first leg of their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Perisic crossed for Ante Budimir to head in the opener at the Stadion Poljud in Split after the home side had squandered an early penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  With France out of sorts, Perisic made it 2-0 before the break and a Croatia side captained by Luka Modric saw out the victory to take to Paris for the return match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not a good night for France as captain Kylian Mbappe made his comeback having not featured in either of the last two international windows, in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappe did have chances, notably seeing a deflected second-half shot from Ousmane Dembele's cutback kept out by a fine Dominik Livakovic save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid superstar has now failed to find the net in his last six appearances for his country, since scoring a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus will now have to find a way of overturning the deficit at the Stade de France on Sunday, otherwise Croatia will be heading to the final four of the Nations League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will take place in June and will be hosted by either Italy or Germany, depending on which of those sides emerges victorious from their last-eight encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won the Nations League in 2021 but suffered a first ever defeat against Croatia in the group stage of the following year's edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest repeat of the 2018 World Cup final, won 4-2 by the French in Moscow, saw Croatia win a spot-kick just five minutes in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate was penalised for a blatant handball inside the area, but Mike Maignan saved Andrej Kramaric's penalty after a long delay due to the goalkeeper having a laser pen shone in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Croatia did get the breakthrough on 26 minutes as Budimir, who has 15 goals in La Liga this season for Osasuna, got in front of William Saliba to connect with a Perisic cross from the left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budimir's header was blocked by Maignan, but the ball still spun into the net in cruel fashion for the goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 2-0 in first-half stoppage time as Saliba blocked a shot by Martin Baturina, only for the ball to fall for PSV Eindhoven veteran Perisic to fire in.
  <br>
  <br>
  France made changes, sending on Dayot Upamecano for Konate at the restart and later bringing on Bradley Barcola for Randal Kolo Muani and Michael Olise for Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter spent more time on the right flank after the break having previously been deployed more centrally.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they could not get a goal back and now face a daunting task in trying to recover the tie. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Thursday, as a Fed-related rally lost steam, and traders looked ahead to the prospect of additional tariffs next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 0.1 percent at 41,953.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,662, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to close at 17,691.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started off in the red, went solidly into the green, only to go back into the red, then back into the green and now we're kind of flatlining," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP, shortly before markets slipped further into the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think investors are basically going to be treading water until April 2," he added, referring to the date at which US President Donald Trump has said he plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, professional firm Accenture's shares slumped 6.7 percent after announcing that the Trump administration's efficiency drive had begun affecting its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The business consulting firm said the cost-cutting drive, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, had hit its federal services business. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA's Boston Celtics are being sold to the head of a California private equity firm for US$6.1 billion, a record price for a US sports franchise, according to reports by The Boston Globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper, citing a league source, said the Celtics ownership had agreed to sell the iconic team to William Chisholm, managing director and co-founder of Symphony Technology Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US$6.1 billion purchase price is the highest ever offered for a North American sports team, surpassing the US$6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of the Celtics, the current NBA champions, still requires the approval of the NBA Board of Governors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is one of the most storied in the league's history, with a record 18 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, is a longtime fan of the team, according to the Globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the new ownership group also includes current Celtics co-owner Robert Hale; Bruce Beal Jr., president of Related Companies; and the global investment firm, Sixth Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper said three other buyers had been under consideration: Steve Pagliuca, a Celtics co-owner; Stan Middleman, a co-owner of MLB's Philadelphia Phillies; and The Friedkin Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grousbeck family and Pagliuca purchased the Celtics for US$360 million in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three NBA teams were sold in 2023 – the Phoenix Suns for US$4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks for US$3.5 billion and the Dallas Mavericks for US$3.5 billion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla was removed from the Vancouver International Auto Show in Canada because of safety concerns, the event organisers said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla as a participant in this week's event, after the automaker was provided multiple opportunities to voluntarily withdraw," Eric Nicholl, executive director for the auto show said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The safety concerns come as protesters across the United States stage demonstrations targeting Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency's move to shrink the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Vancouver Auto Show's primary concern is the safety of attendees, exhibitors, and staff," Nicholl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto on Monday stopped providing financial incentives for Tesla vehicles purchased as taxis or ride shares due to escalating trade tensions between Canada and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's mayor said that the decision was meant to target Musk, a close adviser to the US president. Trump has called for Canada's annexation and imposed tariffs on Canadian products, angering Canadians. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oxygen has been detected in the most distant galaxy ever discovered, surprised astronomers said on Thursday, offering further evidence that stars in the early universe matured far quicker than had been thought possible.
 <br>
  <br>
  The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, which was discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope last year, is so far away that its light took 13.4 billion years to reach Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means the galaxy can also reveal what the universe was like in its infancy, when it was just 300 million years old – two percent of its current age.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since coming online in 2022, the powerful Webb telescope has discovered that galaxies in the young universe were much brighter, more advanced and more numerous than scientists had expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  These discoveries have been so startling they have raised doubts about whether something important is missing in our understanding of the universe.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the latest research, two international teams led by Dutch and Italian astronomers probed the JADES-GS-z14-0 galaxy using the ALMA radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  They detected traces of oxygen, according to the European Southern Observatory, confirming hints previously spotted by the Webb telescope.
  <br>
  <br>
  During this period known as the cosmic dawn, newly born galaxies were thought to only have young stars, which mostly contain light elements like hydrogen and helium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only later were they supposed to get heavier stuff such as oxygen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the two new studies found that JADES-GS-z14-0 has around 10 times more heavy elements than had been anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is like finding an adolescent where you would only expect babies," said Sander Schouws of Leiden Observatory, the first author of a Dutch-led study to be published in The Astrophysical Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The results show the galaxy has formed very rapidly and is also maturing rapidly, adding to a growing body of evidence that the formation of galaxies happens much faster than was expected," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Astrophysicist Stefano Carniani, lead author of the Italian-led paper to be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, said he was "astonished by the unexpected results."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The evidence that a galaxy is already mature in the infant universe raises questions about when and how galaxies formed." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States fell to its lowest happiness ranking ever partly due to a rise in the number of Americans eating their meals alone, an annual UN-sponsored report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Finland ranked as the world's happiest country for the eighth straight year in the World Happiness Report, with locals and experts thanking its grand lakes and strong welfare system for boosting its mood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan, plagued by a humanitarian catastrophe since the Taliban regained control in 2020, once again ranked as the unhappiest country in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States fell to 24th place, its lowest score since the report was first published in 2012, when it recorded its highest showing at number 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The number of people dining alone in the United States has increased 53 percent over the past two decades," the authors said, noting that sharing meals "is strongly linked with well-being."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, roughly one in four Americans reported eating all their meals alone the previous day, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The increasing number of people who eat alone is one reason for declining well-being in the United States," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also noted that the United States was one of few countries to see a rise of so-called "deaths of despair" – from suicide or substance abuse – at a time when those deaths are declining in a majority of countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report surveyed people worldwide in 2022-2024, before US President Donald Trump's shakeup of national and global affairs since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordic countries all stayed among the 10 happiest, with Denmark, Iceland and Sweden trailing Finland, which slightly extended its lead over runner-up Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Costa Rica and Mexico entered the top 10 for the first time, at the sixth and 10th spot respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The happiness ranking is based on a three-year average of individuals' self-assessed evaluations of life satisfaction, as well as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity and corruption. (AFP)

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says America "has been ripped off by every country around the world." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796689_1_20250321011627.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas said it fired rockets at Israeli commercial hub Tel Aviv on Thursday in its first military response to the growing civilian death toll from Israel's resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  Israel said it had closed off the territory's main north-south route as troops expanded the ground operations they resumed on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said 504 people had been killed so far in the Israeli assault this week, including more than 190 children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The armed wing of Hamas, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it fired rockets at Tel Aviv in response to Israel's "massacres" of Gaza civilians.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli army said it intercepted one projectile fired from Gaza and that two others struck an uninhabited area.
  <br>
  <br>
  After weeks of stalemate, Israel resumed its air campaign early on Tuesday with a wave of deadly strikes that drew widespread condemnation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offensive shattered a relative calm that had pervaded the war-ravaged Palestinian territory since a ceasefire took hold on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump "fully supports" Israel's deadly resumption of air and ground operations in Gaza, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday when asked if he was trying to get a Gaza ceasefire back on track. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry became the first woman and African to be elected president of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday declaring it to be an "extraordinary moment."
 <br>
  <br>
  At 41, the two-time Olympic swimming champion is also the youngest ever elected to be the most powerful person in sports governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  She succeeds Thomas Bach, who steps down after 12 years, and said she would work with the six other heavyweight rivals she beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year-old girl I never thought that I would be standing up here one day, getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours," Coventry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not just a huge honour but it is a reminder to every single one of you that I will lead this organisation with so much pride, with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and, I hope, extremely confident in the decision you've taken today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coventry, who was strongly believed to be Bach's favoured candidate, was thought to be in a tight-run race with IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior and World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, to general surprise, the race was over after the first round of voting a majority of the 100-plus IOC members placing their faith in her to meet the serious challenges that lie ahead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages, a senior Beijing official told a visiting business delegation from the SAR on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comment during a meeting with representatives of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (EuroCham) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He appreciated EuroCham's positive assessment of China and the SAR, and praised its contributions in promoting long-term investment from European enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as cooperation between the city and the European business sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government firmly supports the accurate and resolute implementation of 'one country, two systems'...and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, while maintaining a free, open and rule-based business environment," an article published by the office read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, EuroCham told Xia that it has full confidence in Hong Kong, and pledged to bring in more investments, companies and talent from Europe to the SAR.

<img alt="Daichi Kamada's ninth goal for Japan sends the 60,000-strong crowd wild. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796672_1_20250320214131.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan became the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup after second-half goals from Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo gave them a 2-0 win over Bahrain on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The runaway Asian Group C leaders failed to sparkle on a chilly night in Saitama until Crystal Palace forward Kamada pounced for the opener in the 66th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo added another in the 87th minute as Japan punched their ticket to next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be their eighth straight World Cup appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's 5-1 home win over Indonesia earlier in the evening meant Japan would have clinched their place even with a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kamada made sure they did it in style in front of an expectant crowd of just under 60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He latched onto Kubo's reverse pass and dispatched the ball past Bahrain goalkeeper Ebrahim Lutfalla just three minutes after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Kubo added some extra gloss to the night with a left-footed shot from a tight angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's players sprinted onto the pitch at the final whistle and celebrated with the home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan have been in unstoppable form in the Asian third round of qualifiers and went into the game having won five and drawn one of their games so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Hajime Moriyasu started with an experienced line-up featuring Premier League talent in Liverpool's Wataru Endo and Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Endo thought he had given his team the lead in the ninth minute when he rammed home a loose ball in the box, only for the goal to be disallowed by VAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan continued to press for the opener but Bahrain had several dangerous raids on the counterattack and Komail Al Aswad should have done better just after the half-hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were also wasteful and Mitoma blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy in first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriyasu shuffled his pack midway through the second half, bringing on Kamada and Junya Ito for Takumi Minamino and Ritsu Doan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impact was immediate as Kamada gave Japan the lead with his ninth goal for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo went close to adding another with a curling shot that Lutfalla clawed away with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the attacker got his goal with time running out as Japan made sure of the win, and with it a place in North America. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong remains Asia's top financial hub, and third in the world behind New York and London, according to a half-yearly index of global financial centres.
 <br>
  <br>
  Singapore is ranked fourth, while Shanghai, Shenzhen and Seoul round up the top 10 spots in the 37th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  The list is jointly compiled by think tanks Z/Yen Group in London and the Shenzhen-based China Development Institute. It is published every March and September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers ranked 119 financial centres based on 140 instrumental factors, as well as assessments from nearly 5,000 questionnaire respondents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR took top honours in the areas of investment management, insurance and finance, and was second in human capital and infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said the report fully recognises Hong Kong's "leading status and strengths" as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the staunch support of our country, Hong Kong will continue to leverage the advantages under 'one country, two systems', actively integrate into national development, and deepen international exchanges and co-operation, with a view to fulfilling our roles as a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder'," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman also noted the latest budget has rolled out a series of policy initiatives to create new growth areas for the city's financial market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged EU leaders on Thursday to pledge 5 billion euros for artillery shells for Ukraine to strengthen its hand in peace talks, amid divergences over how to bolster Kyiv and the EU's own military capabilities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at an EU summit in Brussels, Kallas called on leaders to match words of support for Kyiv with deeds, as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with his efforts to end the war, including through a rapprochement with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kallas has scaled back a proposal to pledge up to 40 billion euros in military aid to Ukraine this year, with each country contributing according to its economic size, after resistance from some countries, particularly in southern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  She told reporters she was now focusing on what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy – who was to address the summit by video link – says he needs most urgently, such as 2 million artillery shells at a cost of 5 billion euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should at least start to have a really concrete step – not only in words, but also in deeds that we are helping Ukraine right now. Because the stronger they are on the battlefield, the stronger they are behind the negotiating table," Kallas said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstering the EU's own defences also features on the summit agenda, reflecting deep fears that Moscow may attack an EU member in the coming years and doubts about the future of US protection for Europe via the Nato defence alliance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda reiterated his support to Kyiv on Thursday, saying "Ukraine needs our military assistance. Ukraine needs long-range missiles and we are ready to provide it. We should increase the pressure on Russia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to rearm ourselves because otherwise we will be the next victims of Russian aggression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some southern European capitals have been more reticent, reflecting a division between those geographically closer to Russia that have given more aid to Ukraine and those further away that have given less, as a share of their economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he did not like the term "rearm", which the European Commission has used extensively in its push for more defence spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to take into account that the challenges that we face in the southern neighbourhood are a bit different to the ones that the eastern flank faces," he said. (Reuters)

<img alt="City's inflation eased last month, with prices for clothing and footwear products dropping by about two percent year on year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796632_1_20250320173703.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation pace eased last month, rising by just 1.4 percent year on year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 1.4 percent is notably lower compared with the two percent annual increase seen in January, according to official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday also showed that the underlying inflation rate, or the rate excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, rose 1.1 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is also lower compared with the 1.6 percent increase seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the slower pace of inflation was mainly due to the timing of last year's Lunar New Year festival, which fell in February, creasing a high base for comparison for this year, especially in regards to food prices and the costs of package tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  By categories, the biggest price spikes were seen in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, with the inflation gauge for this segment rising 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's followed by the price increase for gas and water, as the inflation rate for the category rose 13.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Products that saw price declines were clothing and footwear, basic food, and durable goods, with their rates dropping between one and two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the city's overall inflation will remain moderate in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs pressures might increase somewhat as the economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain broadly in check, though uncertainties stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts continue to warrant attention," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it acted in accordance with the law over the execution of four Canadian citizens in recent weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in Ottawa on Wednesday that China had executed four Canadian citizens in recent weeks, defying pleas from Ottawa for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the executions that did happen against Canadians in China," Joly said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she was unable to discuss details of the case due to privacy requests from the families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing suggested on Thursday the Canadians had been convicted over narcotics offences, saying "... combating drug crimes is the common responsibility of all countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is a country under the rule of law," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing, she said, "treats defendants of different nationalities equally without discrimination" and "handles cases fairly in strict accordance with the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  China "protects the legitimate rights of the parties concerned as well as the consular rights of the Canadian side, in accordance with the law," Mao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also defended the executions in a statement sent to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognised worldwide as extremely harmful to the society," the embassy statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a 'zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CK Hutchison has reported a 27 percent drop in net profit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Full-year earnings reached HK$17 billion in 2024, down from HK$23.5 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole, the Group's underlying operating results were relatively stable" last year despite a one-time issue related to its Vietnam telecommunications business, chairman Victor Li said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for 2025, Li said the operating environment for the group's businesses is expected to be "volatile and unpredictable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company announced a final dividend of HK$1.514 per share, compared with HK$1.775 the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conglomerate recently proposed selling its ports business, including assets near the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew criticism from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison did not hold a post-earnings press conference on Thursday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

 Stocks mostly rose on Thursday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell suggested any increase in consumer prices caused by tariffs would likely be short-lived, even as the central bank slashed its growth outlook and hiked inflation expectations.

 Drones will be tasked with carrying out services ranging from power line inspections to emergency medical deliveries in Hong Kong’s first-ever low-altitude economy test run.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trial programme comprises 38 projects under the Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox, which will act as a secure testing environment and incubator for drone tech in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here are some of the projects that will soon take off.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
   Remote inspections of electrical lines and towers

   <br>
   <br>
   As part of the pilot project, drones will be used to survey vast areas under CLP Power’s coverage. They will be checking 17,000 kilometres worth of overhead lines and cables as well as the electric towers that are powering their extensive distribution network.
   <br>
   <br>
   Eric Cheung, senior director of power systems at CLP, said these remote-controlled devices can swiftly gather real-time data, rapidly identify external risks, pinpoint fault locations, and expedite assessments and maintenance.
   <br>
   <br>
   Engineering staff will also be able to operate drones from safe distances, he added.
   <br>

    Fully automated: AI powers infrastructure checks
   </b>
   <br>
   <br>

     <span>
     </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Desmond Ho, the founder of local startup Alpha AI says the pilot programme’s regulatory sandbox gives his firm the chance to test their fully-automated drones’ ability to check structures and other infrastructure.
    <br>
    <br>
    The drones – equipped with high-definition cameras – would use AI to detect defects and analyse any damage they find.
    <br>
    <br>
    Ho said that previously, legal restrictions meant their drones had to be controlled manually, adding the use of automated drones will greatly boost efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>
    "We believe that could save over 50 percent of the cost or time for the people, but most importantly, we can reduce the accident rate that could happen in remote areas or outdoors.”
    <br>
    <br>
    He added that this technology can also monitor the condition of buildings during the rainy season and even before and after the passage of typhoons.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alpha AI is already working with the Housing Authority to conduct external wall inspections of public housing estates.

     The pilot project will also make life easier for residents in remote areas, who could soon benefit from unmanned delivery services.
     <br>
     <br>
     Lalamove and Yixin Smart Technologies will be looking to test the delivery of medicine, healthcare products and documents to the farthest of locations, including the outlying islands.
     <br>
     <br>
     Barry Cheung, founder and chairman of the Low-altitude Economy Association of Hong Kong, China, said drones can carry out deliveries when land travel is not an option.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Our core mindset is to use this project to operate the flight between Hong Kong Island to other islands like Cheung Chau," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We use the drone to [make deliveries] to Cheung Chau. This is very efficient, requires [less] time and also [can] provide an immediate response to those needy people especially for the elders in Cheung Chau."

      "They are located on Lai King Hill and their buildings are quite [far] apart. [Currently], they have a third-party logistics company to arrange transportation once per hour to send the specimen and the medical amount to different buildings," said the telecommunication firm’s Becky Lui.
      <br>
      <br>
      "But if we are applying our drone solution to them, then they can arrange the delivery at any time when they need. This will greatly enhance the efficiency of the delivery services."
      <br>
      <br>
      China Mobile also said they hope to expand their drone delivery services to other hospitals.

    Ride-hailing drivers 'should face cabbie-style test'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government should draw up "an appropriate level" of regulations for ride-hailing platforms, such as by making it mandatory for drivers to take a licensing exam similar to that for cabbies, a lawmaker said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Legislator Hoey Simon Lee also said ride-hailing drivers should be subject to legal restrictions because they are not simply operating a private vehicle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should have an appropriate level of regulations – not too tight but not too loose," said Lee, who conducted a study on online-hailing services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it's too tight, it will affect the sharing economy. But if it's too loose, it will not be protective enough for passengers and also not fair to or healthy for the whole sector."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is seeking to regulate platforms offering ride-hailing services with a proposed framework expected to be unveiled this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee urged the administration to require operators to ensure the vehicles providing services are safe and that personal data stored on such platforms are handled properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such vehicles should be required to install dash cameras too, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other than suggestions to regulate ride-hailing services, Lee called on the authorities to consider making changes to policies affecting the taxi trade such as in the design of driving exams and their operations.

    Malaysia gives green light for new MH370 search

<img alt="Relatives of passengers on board the missing MH370 leave after taking part in a demonstration outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796601_1_20250320142559.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia’s government has given final approval for a Texas-based marine robotics company to renew the search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said. Ocean Infinity will be paid US$70 million only if it discovers the wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed .
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing .
  <br>
  <br>
  The final approval for a new search came three months after Malaysia gave the nod in principle to plans for a fresh search.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity chief executive Oliver Punkett reportedly said this year the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said his ministry will ink a contract with Ocean Infinity soon. The firm has reportedly sent a search vessel to the site and indicated that January-April is the best period for the search.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the passengers of flight MH370,” he said. (AP)

<img alt="Luka Doncic catches Denver Nuggets off guard in making a shot. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796600_1_20250320140326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic raced to the 200th 30-point game of his career as the Los Angeles Lakers took advantage of an under-strength Denver Nuggets line-up to score a 120-108 victory over their Western Conference rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Slovenian star Doncic, once again spearheading the Lakers offence in the absence of the injured LeBron James, rattled in 31 points, with nine rebounds and seven assists as the Lakers cruised to a wire-to-wire win on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets, missing Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, were never in the hunt after Doncic poured in 21 points in the first quarter alone as the Lakers sprinted into an early 46-29 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers maintained a double-digit cushion for most of the remainder of the game, with Austin Reaves adding 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 43-25, leapfrogging Denver (44-26) into third place in the Western Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers in February in a shock trade from Dallas, has now scored 30 points or more in eight of his 16 games with the Lakers following his blockbuster move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, every day gets better," Doncic told ESPN following the win. "That's three wins in a row now so we've got to just keep it going.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We go game-by-game because if you think too far in the future maybe you forget about the next game. We know the (standings) are tight but we've just got to try and win every game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' victory ensured that the Oklahoma City Thunder must wait a little longer before clinching the No 1 seeding from the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could have sealed the top seed with a Lakers loss after dismantling the hapless Philadelphia 76ers 133-100 earlier Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could afford to rest Most Valuable Player front-runner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander but were still far too strong for a Sixers team whose regular season is ending in disarray.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Sixers stars Joel Embiid and Paul George ruled out for the rest of the campaign and Tyrese Maxey missing with a lower back injury, the Thunder coasted to a blowout, wire-to-win after leading by as much as 41 points at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven Oklahoma City players finished in double figures with Aaron Wiggins topping the scoring with 26 points as the Thunder improved to 57-12, 12.5 games clear of the Houston Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Rockets meanwhile remained in second place in the West after rolling to their eighth straight win, a 116-108 victory on the road over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Green led the Houston scorers with 26 points, Alperen Sengun providing offensive support with 22 points, 12 rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland slid to their third straight defeat in a 123-119 loss to the Sacramento Kings in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers fell to 56-13 after 27 points from the Kings DeMar DeRozan -- one of seven Sacramento players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves' bid for a top six finish -- and an automatic playoff berth -- lost further momentum in a 119-115 home defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zion Williamson scored 29 points for New Orleans in what was only their seventh away win of the season. The Pelicans (19-51) are already eliminated from postseason contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was another sizeable upset in New York, where the San Antonio Spurs routed the Knicks 120-105 thanks to a sharp-shooting 34-point performance off the bench from Sandro Mamukelashvili.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old New York-born Georgian centre rattled in a perfect seven-from-seven three-pointers in a blistering 19-minute spell.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio improved to 29-39 with the win to keep alive their faint chances of advancing to the Western Conference play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks are 43-25 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-placed Indiana Pacers meanwhile edged closer to the Knicks after staging a late rally to down the Dallas Mavericks 135-131.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers trailed by 11 points with six minutes remaining but conjured a late charge to snatch victory, with Pascal Siakam finishing on 29 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 23 points -- 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Local rates to be at high level for some time: HKMA

<img alt="The Hong Kong Monetary Authority says that the extent and pace of future rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796590_1_20250320130629.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's de facto central bank has cautioned that local borrowing costs will remain at a relatively high level for some time as it kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve, which also left its target rate steady overnight in a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US rate policy decision, the HKMA said the move by the Fed was in line with market expectations and that the latest released "dot plot," a data chart providing a snapshot of the Fed's thinking, suggests that the Fed might reduce target rates by a total of 50 basis points by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it cautioned that the pace of US interest rate cuts remain quite uncertain due to recent changes in economic indicators and volatility in market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty," it said in a statement, adding that future rate cuts depend on factors such as US inflation and labour market data, as well as fiscal and trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, it noted that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner with the liquidity condition remaining stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA added that it will continue to closely monitor market developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's major commercial banks have also followed suit, with HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) keeping their rates at 5.25 percent and Standard Chartered maintaining its rate at 5.5 percent.

    Complete eHealth database 'key for treating patients'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Healthcare officials said on Thursday that patients should not get to pick the medical record to be stored on a government-run electronic platform.
 <br>
  <br>
  The administration is proposing legal changes to make it mandatory for all healthcare workers to upload important patient information onto its eHealth platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the proposal, Deputy Secretary for Health Sam Hui said, patients would still get to decide whether to use the system at all, as well as whether they consent to healthcare providers' access to their records.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope patients understand that a complete medical record is very important for the standard and level of safety of the healthcare services they receive," he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public shouldn't have too much of a choice when it comes to what information they put or not put into the eHealth account."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said if patients do have concerns about joining the electronic system, they can bring them up with healthcare professionals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that the government respects the personal nature of patients' medical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical sector, he said, agrees that records such as drug allergies, jabs received and past diagnoses are very important to reach up-to-date diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials are working on getting an outsourced provider to sync electronic record platforms that better connect the eHealth system with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, family doctor Lam Wing-wo said he agrees that the trend is to have big data, which can help with the public health situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said 60 percent of private doctors currently access records stored on eHealth but that basically all information in the system is provided by the public sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam said that from what he understands, it's not very accurate for the administration to say that private doctors aren't being proactive enough to upload records.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doctors, he pointed out, simply cannot submit data to eHealth because the electronic medical record systems used by the public and private sectors are different.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill to amend the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance will be tabled to the legislature for first reading on Wednesday.

    Low-altitude economy a new growth engine: CE

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the low-altitude economy will be a new growth engine, with a trial programme on drone operations set to help such activities take off and "fly steadily and far".
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the Low-altitude Economy Regulatory Sandbox, pilot projects would be conducted to test airspace management, flight operations, and emergency response to support the use of unmanned aircraft. The initial phase, which involves 38 projects, is expected to begin next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The low-altitude economy not only brings about a number of industries, but also has very extensive application scenarios and huge potential," Lee said at the sandbox's launch ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition to improving urban management and business efficiency, it can also bring new experiences of smart living to the public and become a new growth engine for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sandbox serves as a safe testing ground and an incubator for technologies to develop an environment suitable for the SAR in developing the low-altitude economy, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Transport minister Mable Chan, for her part, said the first phase of the trial programme is expected to last for half a year and will test take-off and landing points of drones as well as their routes in places such as Cyberport and the Hong Kong Science Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial of the sandbox projects would help the authorities to "accumulate experience and data" in devising "comprehensive infrastructure support for the execution of the various low-altitude economic activities", according to the minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the authorities are looking to introduce legislative amendments on regulating small unmanned aircraft to Legco in the second quarter of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to increase the existing weight limit, so as to facilitate heavier and more sophisticated drones to be flying," Chan said.

  "On the other hand, we would also introduce a special provision enabling the Director-General of Civil Aviation to allow trials of even more sophisticated and heavier low-altitude equipment, so as to facilitate our trial of the state-of-the-art models, including those models which can carry passengers."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia's parliament on Thursday passed contentious revisions to the country's military law, which will allocate more civilian posts for military officers, and street protests against the changes are expected to take place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The revisions have been criticised by civil society groups, who say it could take the world's third-biggest democracy back to the draconian 'New Order' era of former strongman president Suharto, when military officers dominated civilian affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaker Puan Maharani led the unanimous vote in a plenary council and officially passed the law, saying that it was in accordance with the principle of democracy and human rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Prabowo Subianto, who took office in October and was a special forces commander under Suharto, has been expanding the armed forces' role into what were considered civilian areas, including his flagship programme of free meals for children.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups have criticised the increased military involvement because they fear it may lead to abuses of power, human rights violations and impunity from consequences for actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the bill requires officers to resign from the military before assuming civilian posts at departments such as the Attorney's General Office and a a lawmaker has said officers could not join state-owned companies, to counter concerns the military would be involved in business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protesters from several democracy groups and students have said they will stage rallies in front of the parliamentary building in Jakarta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some students had camped at the back gate of parliamentary building since Wednesday evening, protesting the law and demanding the government pull out all military personnel from civilian jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police officers forced them to leave the building but they refused, one protestor said. There were just a few dozen protesters at the time the bill was passed by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Military personnel were called in for security in the parliamentary building to assist police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The geopolitical changes and global military technology require the military to transform... to face conventional and non conventional conflicts," Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament, while defending the revised law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty," he added, but did not specify what geopolitical challenges he was referring to. (Reuters)

    Temporary e-permit to assist HKers on the mainland

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers who are travelling and living in mainland China can now apply for a temporary digital permit to travel by air and train within mainland cities if they lose, damage, or forget their permit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the policy announced by the National Immigration Administration (NIA) on Thursday, the temporary digital mainland travel permit will be valid for seven days after application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents can apply for the temporary permit via the NIA’s 12367 mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Under the new policy, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan residents who lose, damage, or forget to carry their travel permits can apply for a temporary electronic permit valid for seven days, allowing them to board flights and trains within mainland cities.” the NIA said in a statement via Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA has also launched a verification service linking travel and residence permits. People can also access this service via the 12367 app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The linkage proof between the permits is for those who are trying to access finance or internet services on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA said they will continue to improve relevant measures to provide "accurate and equally convenient" services for SAR residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong welcomed the NIA announcement, but pointed out the arrangement only allows travellers to use two modes of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope temporary electronic permits can be used for immigration in the future," he told reporters at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hong Kong residents lose their permit on the mainland, I hope they can also apply for a temporary electronic permit, allowing them to return to the city, instead of wasting their time waiting at border control points."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong's delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee Starry Lee said the arrangement helps facilitate travel between mainland cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she hopes central authorities could consider permanent electronic permits for Hong Kong residents in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will make it more convenient for people with travel permits who reside and live on the mainland," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The numbers of a mainland travel permit and a mainland identity card are different, and sometimes it may be inconvenient and time costly to deal with different situations."

<img alt="China has traditionally been one of Canada's biggest export markets for canola, grown on farms in such places as Alberta. File photo: Artur Widak/AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796564_1_20250320112443.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tariffs on Canadian products including rapeseed oil and pork come into effect on Thursday, with an industry lobby warning the new levies will have a "devastating impact" on farmers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs, announced this month, follow a Beijing probe into levies imposed by Ottawa on Chinese goods last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  They hit rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas imported from Canada with a 100 percent surcharge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is among the world's top producers of canola, a rapeseed crop that is used to make cooking oil, animal feed and biodiesel fuel, and China has historically been one of its largest customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aquatic products and pork, meanwhile, will face a 25 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian industry leaders have warned they would be hit hard by the fresh tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New tariffs from China on Canadian canola oil and meal will have a devastating impact on canola farmers and the broader value chain at a time of increased trade and geopolitical uncertainty," said Canola Council of Canada president Chris Davison.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the federal government to immediately engage with China, with a view to resolving this issue," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fresh tariffs come as both Canada and China face deepening trade tensions with the US, which under President Donald Trump has rolled out stiff new tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ottawa in August placed 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, matching US measures seeking to fend off the import of Chinese cars into North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced a surcharge on imports of steel and aluminum products from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's commerce ministry said a probe into these measures found that Canadian policies "disrupted the normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Beijing, some residents said they were supportive of China's tariffs on goods from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become strong and doesn't need to rely on others for everything," said Zheng Ruitao, a Beijing resident in his thirties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me personally, it has not much impact, the impact might be on the country," said Song Qing, another Beijing resident. (AFP)

    'Accommodate workers while changing eHealth system'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical sector lawmaker David Lam on Thursday welcomed the government's plans to amend the law to boost the development of its “eHealth” platform, but hoped authorities would be flexible when implementing any changes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government-developed platform, launched in 2016, enables the sharing of electronic health records among healthcare providers in both the public and private sectors, while also letting people access their own records.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under proposed changes to the Electronic Health Record Sharing System Ordinance, the secretary for health will be empowered to require all healthcare providers to enter important data into their patients' eHealth accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Healthcare providers failing to meet such requirements could face a fixed fine of HK$1,500 and be prosecuted for a fine of up to HK$50,000.

  , Lam said authorities should take into account the pressure that frontline medical workers face when considering what action to take if records weren't uploaded in a timely fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are still relatively elderly doctors who do not use computer systems, they are still using paper records. I think we have to assist these colleagues in changing to computer systems, or helping them in other ways, so that their records can be uploaded."

    Trump urges Fed to cut rates as tariffs take effect

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump urged the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut interest rates to help offset effects of his tariffs, renewing his vocal disagreement with the central bank's decision-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Do the right thing," Trump demanded in a Wednesday night post on his Truth Social site, hours after the Fed decided to hold rates steady, while reducing its growth forecast and hiking its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve has pencilled in two rate cuts this year, but chairman Jerome Powell noted that "uncertainty today is unusually elevated" and that inflation is ticking up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that the tariffs – which are being met with trade retaliation by some countries – threaten to possibly tip the US economy and others into recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has admitted that the economy may suffer "a little disturbance" as his planned levies take hold, but that America is otherwise on the cusp of a "golden age".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's message, he again stressed that April 2, when he plans to enact "reciprocal tariffs" designed to reset global trade, would be a "liberation day" for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he wants US interest rates to come down as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," he posted.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed disagreement with the Fed's rate decisions, urging them to be lowered to boost the economy. (AFP)

    Israel resumes ground attacks in Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel resumed ground operations in Gaza and issued what it called a "last warning" for Palestinians to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
 <br>
  <br>
  The operation on Wednesday followed Israel's most intense air strikes on Gaza since a truce took hold in January, killing more than 400 people, according to the territory's health ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel defied calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, Gazans were left to once again comb through rubble to find the bodies of their loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're digging with our bare hands," said a man trying to dislodge a child's body from a heap of concrete in Gaza City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones", families with young children filled the roads leading out of northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza," governed by Hamas since 2007, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Take the advice of the president of the United States. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open up for you -- including the possibility of leaving for other places in the world for those who want to."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a warning earlier this month by US President Donald Trump, who said: "To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 58 are still held by Gaza militants, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas says it is willing to negotiate and has called on the international community to act to bring the war to an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  An official from the group rejected, however, Israeli demands to renegotiate the three-stage deal agreed with Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas has not closed the door on negotiations but we insist there is no need for new agreements," Taher al-Nunu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks have stalled over how to proceed with the ceasefire, after the first phase expired in early March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have sought to change the terms of the deal by extending phase one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas wants negotiations for phase two, meant to establish a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza while the remaining hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving to the second phase seems to be a non-option for Israel," said Ghassan Khatib, a political analyst and former Palestinian Authority minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't like the second phase because it involves ending the war without necessarily achieving their objective of ending Hamas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and Washington have portrayed Hamas's rejection of a phase one extension as a refusal to release more hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli bombardment sent a stream of new casualties to the few hospitals still functioning in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  A UN Office for Project Services employee was killed and at least five other people wounded when a UN building in the central city of Deir el-Balah was hit by "explosive ordnance," the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was not an accident," UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva said, adding that "attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law".
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 280 UN employees have been killed since the start of the war, according to the UN chief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of Israeli protesters massed in Jerusalem, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of resuming strikes on Gaza without regard for the safety of the remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war began with Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gaza civil defence agency's spokesman Mahmud Bassal said on Wednesday that at least 470 people had been killed in the territory since Israel resumed large-scale air strikes overnight from Monday to Tuesday. (Reuters)

 Australian Nick Kyrgios came from behind to defeat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the first round of the Miami Open to earn his first win since October 2022.

  "It has been a long journey even to get to the start line of matches and be scared to even be able to finish them," he told Tennis TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to come in and get a win and feel like I belong again, it's pretty special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrgios, who had lost all three matches he played this year, got off to a slow start on a hot and humid day in South Florida but after dropping the first set, he began to settle in, finding his rhythm on serve to level the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decider, he hit a well-disguised drop shot to set up a break point and converted when his American opponent double-faulted to hand Kyrgios a 4-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  From there he rode his best shot, his booming serve, to the finish line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Kyrgios is Russian Karen Khachanov, who stunned the Australian in a hard-fought quarter-final at the 2022 US Open, a tournament Kyrgios was among the favourites to win that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after that bitter disappointment he would take a lengthy break from the court to tend to a series of knee, foot and wrist problems that threatened to permanently derail the 29-year-old's career before returning to the tour this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Gael Monfils, Belgian David Goffin, and Russian-born Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik were among the players who also advanced out of the first round with wins on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, former US Open champion Emma Raducanu barely broke a sweat as she brushed aside Japanese wild card Sayaka Ishii 6-2 6-1 to reach the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu, who was ousted in the first round at Indian Wells, regained her footing against Ishii as she won 77 percent of her first-serve points, fired down six aces and converted five of her six break point chances in the 65-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Britain's Raducanu will be American world number 10 Emma Navarro, who won a WTA 500 event in Mexico in early March for her second career title before losing in the third round at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other women's action Belinda Bencic, fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, overcame a 5-3 third-set deficit to beat Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska on Grandstand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss former world number four gave birth to her daughter Bella in April and won her first WTA title as a mother when she triumphed at the WTA 500 event in Abu Dhabi last month.

    White House attacks courts for 'usurping' powers

<img alt="Karoline Leavitt in a press briefing at the White House. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796546_1_20250320101240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House accused judges of "usurping" executive power in its latest broadside against federal courts whose rulings have gone against President Donald Trump's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged there had been a "concerted effort by the far left" to pick judges who were "clearly acting as partisan activists" to deal with cases involving the Republican's actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only are they usurping the will of the president and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public," she said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt in particular lashed out at district judge James Boasberg, who ordered the suspension over the weekend of deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants carried out under an obscure wartime law, calling him a "Democrat activist."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador as part of its mass deportation program of undocumented migrants. Their names or alleged offences have not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump personally called for the judge's impeachment on Tuesday, saying Boasberg was "a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yale-educated Boasberg, 62, was first appointed to the bench by president George W Bush, a Republican, and later named a district court judge by Obama, a Democrat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's comments drew a rare public rebuke from US Chief Justice John Roberts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision," Roberts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boasberg, in an order in the deportation case on Wednesday, also issued a pointed reminder to Justice Department lawyers that court rulings are to be obeyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the Supreme Court has made crystal clear, the proper recourse for a party subject to an injunction it believes is legally flawed... is appellate review, not disobedience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federal judges are nominated by the president for life and can only be removed by being impeached by the House of Representatives for "high crimes or misdemeanors" and convicted by the Senate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Impeachment of federal judges is exceedingly rare and the last time a judge was removed by Congress was in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in an interview aired on Fox News Channel's "The Ingraham Angle" on Wednesday, said the chief justice "didn't mention my name in the statement."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But many people have called for [Boasberg's] impeachment," he said. "He actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders... out of our country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, that's a presidential job," Trump said. "That's not for a local judge to be making that determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judges have dealt Trump a number of setbacks in recent weeks as his administration pursues its wholesale overhaul of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship has been blocked by the courts and a judge on Tuesday ordered an immediate halt to the shutdown of the main US aid agency by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the same day, another judge suspended the Pentagon's ban on transgender people serving in the military.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South African-born billionaire Musk railed against what he called a "judicial coup" in posts on his social network X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need 60 senators to impeach the judges and restore rule of the people," Musk said, misstating the process and the actual number of senators required, which is 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also lashed out at the judiciary, accusing it of waging an "assault on democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "District court judges have assumed the mantle of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Secretary of Homeland Security and Commander-in-Chief," Miller said on X. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, the first convicted felon to serve in the White House, has a history of attacking the judges who presided over his civil and criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's administration now appears bent on a showdown with the judiciary as he asserts extraordinary levels of executive power. (AFP)

    Trump to sign order to dismantle Education Department

<img alt="A protester stands near the US Department of Education headquarters after the agency said it would lay off nearly half its staff. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796539_1_20250320092913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump is expected to sign an order on Thursday aiming to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a long-held goal of American conservatives.
 <br>
  <br>
  The order, which several media outlets on Wednesday reported would be signed during a White House ceremony, comes as efforts are already underway in the department to drastically downsize its staffing and slash funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's education secretary, former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, issued a memo shortly after her swearing in on March 3 saying the agency would be beginning its "final mission."
  <br>
  <br>
  The next week, she moved to halve the department's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, 78, promised to decentralise education during his election campaign, saying he would devolve the department's powers to state governments, as desired for decades by many Republicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the United States, with only about 13 percent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law, the Education Department, created in 1979, cannot be shuttered without the approval of Congress and Republicans do not have the votes to push that through.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, as with other federal agencies under Trump's second administration, the department is likely to see further cuts to programmes and employees, which could significantly cripple its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), whose rapid actions have met pushback in courts for possibly exceeding executive authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar move to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was halted on Monday by a federal judge, who said the push likely violated the Constitution. (AFP)

    Chile reviews Chinese observatory plans

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chile said on Wednesday it was reviewing an agreement for the construction of a Chinese astronomical observatory on its soil, a project that has drawn criticism from Washington as it jostles with Beijing for influence in Latin America.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under an agreement signed by President Xi Jinping in 2016 with Chile's Catholic University of the North (UCN), the Ventarrones Astronomical Park was to be built in Chile's Atacama desert - home to the world's darkest skies and numerous other observatories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project is under review, it is not cancelled," the foreign ministry in Santiago said in a statement, without providing reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said its legal department was studying the agreement and had contacted the UCN and the Chinese embassy for more information.
  <br>
  <br>
  UCN said it had made the requested data available. The embassy said the observatory was "an open and transparent international initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Xi's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program, and China has surpassed the United States as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and several other countries. (AFP)

    Japan marks 30 years since subway sarin attack

<img alt="A commuter is treated after being exposed to sarin gas fumes on the Tokyo Metro system on March 20, 1995. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796530_1_20250320083940.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan on Thursday marked the 30th anniversary of the sarin gas attack on Tokyo's subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800.
 <br>
  <br>
  A small group of Tokyo subway workers were to hold a solemn annual ceremony at Kasumigaseki station at the heart of the capital's government district, one of several areas targeted in the 1995 carnage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victims and experts warn that the cult behind the coordinated attack remains active and is recruiting young people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On March 20, 1995, five members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult dropped bags of Nazi-developed sarin nerve agent inside morning commuter trains, piercing the pouches with sharpened umbrella tips before fleeing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trains drove on, trapping passengers inside with the deadly fumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the trains stopped, passengers streamed out of stations vomiting and struggling to breathe, with emergency workers providing care by the side of the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack killed 13 people, while a 14th victim died in 2020 after suffering severe brain damage in the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 5,800 others were injured, many of whom are still suffering from vision problems, fatigue and psychological trauma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cult's wild-haired, nearly blind leader Shoko Asahara was executed in 2018 along with 12 disciples for the attack and other violent crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asahara, whose real name was Chizuo Matsumoto, preached that the apocalypse was coming and that murders could elevate souls to a higher realm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aum has been disbanded, but its dead leader is still worshipped in Japan by an estimated 1,600 members of successor groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts warn that the groups are reaching young recruits in secret both in person and through social media and messaging apps, where they are also spreading posts saying that Aum's crimes were misportrayed. (AFP)

    Price adjustment can help those most in need: HA

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796525_1_20250320073507.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority said it hopes an increase in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) service fee would ensure resources are reserved for those most in need.
 <br>
  <br>
  A&E services are heavily subsidised by taxpayers' money. The average cost per case stood at HK$2,070 in 2023-24, but each patient is only charged HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sticking to the current five-category triage system, the fee could be waived or reduced for the most critical patients, while less urgent ones - or those in categories four and five - may soon have to pay more, sources told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government review is under way and results could be announced as early as the end of this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital Authority director Michael Wong, who works on quality and safety, insists a price adjustment can change people's habits when seeking medical attention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In 2017, the price increased from HK$100 to HK$180. The next year, the accident and emergency department attendance has dropped five percent. This drop is mainly contributed by category four and five patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From then on, we noted that the ratio of category four and five patients has remained lower than the previous year. It actually has some persistent effect on these patients seeking medical help. So we hope that in our coming fee adjustment, we'll have some persistent effects for our patients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost two million patients attended A&E services at the city's 18 public hospitals in 2024, with more than half of them deemed as semi-urgent or non-urgent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With manpower and resources stretched thin, the authority said around 77 percent of urgent patients were attended to within half an hour, lower than its service target of 90 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  By bumping up the service charge, the authority hoped patients with milder symptoms can seek alternative treatment options, such as general out-patient clinics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-urgent patients faced an average waiting time of 190 minutes last year, up from 129 minutes in 2015.

 The 2027 Tour de France will start in Edinburgh with the first three stages taking place in Scotland, England and Wales, the organisers ASO announced at a ceremony in the Scottish capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The women's Tour de France will also start from Britain in 2027, from a location yet to be revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be the third men's start from the United Kingdom but the two previous Grand Departs both took place in England, making these the first stages ever to be raced in Scotland and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two stages of the 2007 edition were in London with Yorkshire hosting the start of the 2014 race.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to an official report, the Grand Depart of the 2014 race attracted 3.5 million spectators to the roadside as two stages took place in Yorkshire, with a third between Cambridge and London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popular success was absolutely phenomenal," Tour director Christian Prudhomme said. "We were faced with walls of people, a great mass of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prudhomme said setting off from the "magical city" of Edinburgh was something he had in mind for some time but its remoteness had worked against it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scotland was already a candidate against Yorkshire for 2014 and one of the major differences at the time was the distance from France," added Prudhomme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since then, there have been new UCI regulations which mean that, once every four years, we have a 'joker' to start on the Friday, which fundamentally changes the deal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ASO organisers used the exemption in 2022 for the start in Copenhagen instead of a Saturday. They will use it again in 2027 to start on Friday July 2, 2027 for three complete stages on British soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Details of the cities have yet to be revealed, but the peloton will head straight for England, where the second stage will also take place. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's foreign minister David Lammy on Wednesday called for a transparent investigation into an Israeli air strike on a UN building in Gaza.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Appalled a UN compound in Gaza was hit this morning," Lammy wrote on X. "This incident must be investigated transparently and those responsible held to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel announced renewed ground operations in Gaza on Wednesday and issued what it called a "last warning" to residents of the Palestinian territory to return hostages and remove Hamas from power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces this week conducted the deadliest wave of air strikes since the start of a truce in January, killing hundreds of people, according to the health ministry in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military said it had "begun targeted ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip to expand the security perimeter and create a partial buffer between the north and south".
  <br>
  <br>
  As Israel kept up its renewed bombardment despite a chorus of calls from foreign governments to preserve the ceasefire, long lines of fleeing civilians filled the roads of Gaza on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Families with young children fled northern Gaza for areas further south, fearing for their lives after Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as "combat zones".
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred Oola, senior medical officer at the Red Cross field hospital in Rafah, said the renewed strikes had shattered the relative calm of the past two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, we can feel the panic in the air... and we can see the pain and devastation in the faces of those we are helping," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the "residents of Gaza", Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a video statement: "This is the last warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, The Gaza civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Wednesday killed 14 members of the same family in the northern town of Beit Lahia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that "at least 14 martyrs and several wounded from one family" were transferred to a hospital "after the (Israeli) occupation carried out an air strike targeting a house where a mourning tent was held", adding several people were feared buried under the rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The casualties and victims had gathered at the home of a family who were mourning the recent loss of their loved ones when the strike occurred. They were then transferred to the Indonesian Hospital, according to the Palestinian News Agency. (AFP)

<img alt="The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,964. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796513_1_20250320055039.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but pointed to increased economic uncertainty, while Treasury bond yields tumbled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fed's interest rate decision was expected, but the central bank cut its growth forecast for 2025 and hiked its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has nonetheless still penciled in two rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But yields on the 10-year US Treasury note, a closely-watched proxy of monetary policy, fell sharply as the Fed also slowed the pace at which it will shrink the size of its balance sheet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,964.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 5,675, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to 17,750.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Uncertainty today is unusually elevated," Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision was published, adding that at least part of a recent inflation uptick was related to the White House tariff policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Powell also communicated some confidence about the US economic outlook, noting key indicators that have stayed solid in spite of surveys showing weakening consumer confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the market liked hearing the Fed Chair sound reasonably upbeat about the economy," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who noted that the drop in Treasury yields boosts expectations that mortgage rates also will fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing jumped 6.8 percent as CFO Brian West told a Wall Street conference the company's efforts to improve plane assembly operations were on track so far in the first quarter and struck an upbeat tone on the company's outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Mills fell 2.1 percent after reporting a five percent drop in sales as it pointed to a slowdown in demand for snacking and a drop in orders from retailers managing inventories. (AFP)

    Trump suggests US takeover of Ukraine's power plants

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump hailed a "very good" call with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday, a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on Kyiv's power plants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said efforts to secure a full ceasefire in Russia's three-year-old war remained "on track," despite the fact that his call with Putin failed to produce any broader peace deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of continuing attacks, Zelensky said after the "frank" call that Ukraine was ready to pause strikes on both Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he spoke for around an hour with his Ukrainian counterpart, their first conversation since they had a blazing televised row in the Oval Office just over two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Much of the discussion was based on the call made yesterday with President Putin in order to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs," Trump said on his Truth Social network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very much on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House later said that during the call Trump had floated US "ownership" of Ukrainian power plants as it would be the "best protection" for them.

   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's Washington correspondent Simon Marks said while Trump was showing American willingness to help Ukraine repair its damaged power infrastructure, it also showcased how transactional his administration is on foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was another one of those jarring moments at the White House when that was suddenly announced. There had been no indication at all leading up to either of these calls with Vladimir Putin or Volodymyr Zelensky that that was what Donald Trump had in mind... it also indicates that for Donald Trump, so many of these international issues he seems to think can be resolved like a business negotiation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire former real estate mogul has already pushed Kyiv into a deal to give the United States preferential access to its critical mineral resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also pledged to help Ukraine get more air defence equipment from Europe, a statement from National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while Ukraine has already agreed to a US plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Russia, Putin is still refusing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin leader insisted during his call with Trump that a full ceasefire was only possible if the West halts its billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv – Moscow's long-standing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also demanded Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm, and that it must halt mandatory mobilisation. (AFP)

    Malaysia agrees terms for resumption of MH370 search

<img alt="Very little of the doomed Malaysian Airlines plane has ever been found. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796487_1_20250319224244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia has agreed to the terms and conditions of an agreement with exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, its transport minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014 in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision will enable commencement of seabed search operations in a new location estimated to cover 15,000 sq km (5,790 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean, based on a "no find, no fee" principle, minister Loke Siew Fook said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity will receive US$70 million if the wreckage is successfully located, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers," Loke said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government in December said it had agreed in principle with Ocean Infinity's proposal to resume the hunt for MH370. The firm had conducted the last search for the plane that ended in 2018 but failed on two attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those followed an underwater search by Malaysia, Australia and China in a 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the data of automatic connections between an Inmarsat satellite and the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ship that will look for the missing plane was deployed to its Indian Ocean search zone late last month, ship tracking data showed, even though a deal had yet to be signed with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how long the search contract with Ocean Infinity would be. Loke had previously said it would cover an 18-month period. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the King's Park site, currently home to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, will be retained for healthcare purposes despite a relocation plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Most clinical inpatient services at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, including the accident and emergency department, will gradually move to the New Acute Hospital in Kai Tak starting early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ambulatory Care Centre will remain at the current King's Park site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said officials have no plan to convert the site for purposes other than healthcare at this stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the convenient geographical location, it will be a feasible option to consider the expansion of the ambulatory care services at the King's Park site based on the demand of the population in Kowloon," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that health officials will consider the future use and development plan of the King's Park site when they review the Second Hospital Development Plan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's resumption of strikes on the Gaza Strip is a major step in the wrong direction after its ceasefire with Palestinian militant group Hamas earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday alongside Jordan's King Abdullah II.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of Israeli strikes…despite the efforts of mediators, represents a dramatic step backwards," Macron said ahead of talks in Paris with Abdullah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's dramatic for the Palestinians of Gaza, who are again plunged into the terror of bombardment, and dramatic for the [Israeli] hostages and their families who live in the nightmare of uncertainty."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel earlier this week carried out its deadliest bombing of Gaza since a fragile ceasefire began in January between Israel and the Palestinian territory's Islamist rulers Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed Israeli air strikes in the night of Monday to Tuesday killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. They have continued since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron slammed Hamas, saying the "axis of resistance is today an illusion", but also warned Israel that there could be "no Israeli military solution in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jordanian king called the strikes "an extremely dangerous step that adds further devastation to an already dire humanitarian situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ceasefire must be restored and the flow of aid must resume immediately," Abdullah said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the war stops, France has thrown its support behind a plan put forward by Arab nations, including Jordan, to rebuild Gaza without evicting its 2.4 million Palestinian residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We French and Europeans are ready to contribute to these deliberations and to this plan," Macron said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron said he and other European leaders would discuss it on Thursday at the European Council, "among ourselves and with the Secretary General of the United Nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Britain, Germany and Italy earlier this month backed the plan, hailing it as a "realistic path" for Gaza to return to the control of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority after nearly two decades of Hamas rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel and the United States have rejected the proposal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UK teenager who killed three family members and planned to outdo notorious US massacres to become "the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century" was on Wednesday jailed for a minimum of 49 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Prosper, 18 at the time of the killings, used a shotgun to kill his mother Juliana Falcon, 48, sister Giselle, 13, and brother Kyle, 16, who also received more than 100 knife wounds, at their home in Luton, southern England, in September 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your ambition was notoriety. You wanted to be known posthumously as the world's most famous school shooter of the 21st century," Judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said on Wednesday as she sentenced the now 19-year-old Prosper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosper told police upon his arrest of his "Friday the 13th" plan to kill four-year-old pupils and two teachers at a nearby primary school, and then himself.

  He said his aim was to conduct an attack more deadly than the US Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech massacres, but the plan was interrupted when his mother woke up before he could kill his family in their sleep.

  The noisy struggle alerted neighbours, who called the police.

  "You explicitly sought to emulate and outdo Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old American who shot dead 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut in 2012," the judge said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You aimed for 34 deaths, one more than the deadliest school shooting of recent times in the United States of America, at Virginia Tech in 2007," she added.

  Prosper, who experts said showed symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), was handed a life sentence, with a minimum term of 49 years. Taking into account the time already served, he will serve a minimum of 48 years and 177 days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani hit a home run but Roki Sasaki had a wobbly Major League Baseball debut as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 in Tokyo on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Ohtani thrilled another sold-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome when he blasted a one-run shot in the fifth inning as the World Series champion Dodgers completed a two-game season-opening sweep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese pitcher Sasaki showcased his ferocious fastball but struggled with his command in his first start since joining the Dodgers over the winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old hit 60 kph with his first three pitches and struck out three batters but also gave up five walks in three innings on the mound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Edman and Kike Hernandez also hit home runs for the Dodgers, who beat the Cubs 4-1 in Tuesday's Game 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 40,000 fans erupted when Ohtani hit a home run to right centre field in his third trip to the plate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The call was reviewed but eventually upheld, giving fans an excuse to celebrate a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs walked Ohtani at his next at-bat, prompting loud boos from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is a national hero in Japan and his first visit with the Dodgers has been eagerly anticipated for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were also waiting to see the hotly tipped Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed in Japan's 2011 tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander got his first MLB strikeout against the Cubs' Japanese batter Seiya Suzuki, letting out a loud grunt as he launched another thunderous fastball.
  <br>
  <br>
  His command faltered as the game went on and he walked three batters in a row in the third inning before getting himself out of trouble with two straight strikeouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edman hit the Dodgers' first home run of the season off Cubs starting pitcher Justin Steele in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hernandez crushed another in the fourth inning, hitting the ball high into the stands with a massive shot. (AFP)

    Over 60 cabbies penalised under demerit points system

<img alt="Authorities say none of the penalised taxi drivers under the demerit system have racked up enough points to be disqualified. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796466_1_20250319184126.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sixty-six taxi drivers have been slapped with demerit points for overcharging, refusing passengers and not taking the most direct route under a new penalty points system that was implemented around half a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  But none of them have racked up the 15 penalty points or more needed to be disqualified from working.
  <br>
  <br>
  The system – aimed at targeting taxi driver malpractice – came into effect on September 22 and covers 11 offences including overcharging and driving an indirect route. Penalty points are meted out to taxi drivers who commit any of the offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cabbies would also be ordered to take a driver improvement course if they get 10 points or more within two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Until March 9, 2025, 66 taxi drivers incurred points under the [taxi-driver-offence points] system," said transport chief Mable Chan in a written response to the Legislative Council on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant offences committed include overcharging, refusing to accept a hire or driving to a destination other than by the most direct practicable route."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan revealed that five taxi drivers incurred three points, 12 received five points and 49 accumulated 10 points since the system came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, no taxi driver is liable to disqualification from driving a taxi due to incurrence of 15 or more points," Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  To further improve taxi services in Hong Kong, the minister said officials are looking to introduce the proposed legislative amendments in the second quarter of this year on requiring taxis to install in-vehicle cameras, dash cams and global navigation satellite systems.

<img alt="Tencent posts strong fourth quarter financial performances, bolstered by its gaming and advertising businesses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796452_1_20250319182448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Tencent on Wednesday reported a stronger than expected fourth-quarter growth, boosted by a surge in gaming and advertising revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which is the largest video game company in the world, and also the operator of WeChat, saw its revenue grow by 11 percent year on year to 172.4 billion yuan (US$23.83 billion) for the quarter ending in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was much higher compared with the 168.9 billion yuan expected by the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit, meanwhile, was up 90 percent year on year to 51.3 billion yuan during the three month period, also higher than the expected 46.03 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The growth came as its gaming business regained momentum and showed robust recovery since mid-2024, with its domestic gaming revenue rising by 23 percent year on year to 33.2 billion yuan and its global gaming revenue climbing 15 percent to 16 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said the increases were due to a low base from the previous year, as well as growth in some of its hit games including "Honour of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite".
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful launches of its new games such as "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" and "Delta Force" as well as regulatory easing over the nation's gaming sector also helped bolster its growth, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the full year of 2024, the Shenzhen-headquartered firm registered a profit growth of 68 percent year on year to 194 billion yuan, while revenue grew by eight percent year on year to 660 billion yuan, meeting market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also attributed artificial intelligence technology as a driving force to improve its various products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Starting a few months ago, we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products,” Tencent said in its earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe these stepped-up investments will generate ongoing returns via uplifting productivity in our advertising business and longevity of our games, as well as longer term value from accelerated consumer usage of our AI applications and enterprise adoption of our AI services," the firm added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company proposed a final dividend of HK$4.5 per share for the year, marking a 32 percent rise from a year earlier.
