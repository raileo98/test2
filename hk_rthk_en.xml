  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Vatican on Tuesday will publish its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church, a move requested by Pope Francis amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors said its report will be a "first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting", and will document "where risks remain, and where advances can be found".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pope Francis set up the independent panel of experts in December 2014 amid an avalanche of revelations of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy across the world, and its cover-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the commission has faced strong criticism over its organisation, funding and role, with several high-profile members quitting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2022, Francis incorporated the commission into the Roman Curia – the government of the Holy See – and asked for an annual, "reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first of these will be published on Tuesday, launched at the Vatican by the commission's president, US Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement ahead of the launch, the commission described the report as a "new tool", part of a process to set out clear standards on protecting children and vulnerable adults.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It will be divided into four areas – a review of safeguarding policies in 15 to 20 local churches each year, trends across continents, policies within the Vatican and the Church's broader role in society.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It collects resources and practices to be shared across the Universal Church, and makes specific recommendations to promote further progress in safeguarding," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed the hope that the Hong Chi Association will review the operations of its care homes, after a former staff member was charged for the alleged sexual assault of two intellectually impaired residents at its Tai Po facility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee described the incident – which Hong Chi said took place in August and saw the 38-year-old suspect sacked – as despicable, saying police should investigate the matter thoroughly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chief Executive noted that an independent review committee formed by the association should file a report over the matter as soon as possible to ensure that the interest of residents came first.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I hope the committee will look at the home’s overall operation, including the services it provides to residents, as well as effective management and supervision systems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There should be a comprehensive system for training, discipline and supervision of its staff. They must put the interests of the residents first."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said he thinks the Social Welfare Department did the right thing by cutting short the licence review period for the Tai Po home from three years to one.

    RainLily sees rise in reports of sexual offences

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rape crisis centre RainLily on Tuesday urged officials to reform laws on sexual offences and improve the city’s sex education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RainLily said the number of cases reported to the centre nearly doubled from just over 1,000 in 2009-2013 to almost 2,000 in 2019-2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also found a significant delay in help-seeking, with people waiting an average of around four years before asking the group for assistance in the past five years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Doris Chong, the centre’s executive director, said it’s not easy for people to seek help.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For example, they don't know how to seek help or where to seek help. Also, they don't know how to tell the incidents to others because they always think that it's a shame incident,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group also said many cases never get to court because complainants do not feel protected enough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albert Yau, a senior research officer with RainLily, stressed the need for a more supportive environment to encourage victims to speak up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “There may be a lot of stigma attached to such incidents. So I think in order to encourage the victims to seek help promptly, we have to create a more friendly environment to tell them that you will be supported by us,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The centre wants the government to define “consent” more clearly in the law and to expand the scope of rape offences to better protect victims.

    US ban on China tech investment will harm all: CE

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday hit out at the US government for finalising plans to ban American investments in AI and other advanced technology sectors in China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Treasury Department said overnight that a ban on investments in semiconductors, microelectronics and quantum information technologies will come into effect in January, citing national security concerns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the Biden administration's move will be a two-edged sword, harming the interests of both China and the US.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It once again shows that American politicians seek their own political interests, undermining normal investment and trade, the free market and economic order. This will harm the global supply chain," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This harms the interests of others, as well as that of the US as a nation, its people and its companies. They will reap what they sow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The SAR government will defend its own interests and the interests of Hong Kong companies. We will also work with the country to protect national interests."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, the SAR government said it strongly opposes the proposed ban.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson noted that in the past decade, the US had enjoyed a trade surplus of US$271.5 billion with Hong Kong, the largest among its global trading partners, and the surplus would suffer because of Washington's move.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the chief executive said he will lead a delegation to Shanghai next Monday to attend the opening of the China International Import Expo, which will also host a dedicated session promoting investment in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said more than 300 Hong Kong companies will take part in the expo, making up of around a tenth of the total participating firms, adding that SAR officials will sign pacts with their Shanghai counterparts on several key projects.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings posted a 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as its wealth and wholesale banking benefited from slower-than-expected rate cuts while it embarks on one of the largest overhauls in its history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Europe's largest bank posted pretax profit of US$8.5 billion for the July-to-September period versus US$7.7 billion a year earlier. The result compared with a US$7.6 billion mean average of broker estimates compiled by HSBC.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-headquartered, Asia-focused bank also announced an additional share buyback of up to US$3 billion, on top of a US$6 billion buyback programme announced earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lender unveiled a roadmap for its sweeping restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery designed to control costs and improve efficiency. HSBC announced last week that it will merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into East and West, under a new leadership structure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will begin to implement these plans immediately," Elhedery said in an earnings statement, but further details will be disclosed in February next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HSBC kept its 2024 and 2025 near-term return on tangible equity goal – a performance target – at mid-teens for two years but said in the statement that the "the outlook for interest rates has changed, and been volatile". (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Government data on Tuesday showed that home prices dropped last month to their lowest level since August 2016.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Private residential prices in September were down 1.67 percent month-on-month and 12.5 percent year-on-year, according to the Rating and Valuation Department.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rents, meanwhile, rose for the seventh consecutive month to reach a five-year high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eddie Kwok from CBRE Hong Kong said measures announced in the recent Policy Address, such as an adjustment to the maximum loan-to-value ratio for mortgages, helped stabilise prices in the past two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said prices are likely to bottom out soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yield-seeking investors may be a demand driver entering the residential market as residential prices reached a relatively low level, coupled with expected lower financing costs going forward," he said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kwok said that rents, which were 5.8 percent higher in September year-on-year, are likely to continue to rise, but should moderate in the short term now that students from overseas have already moved into their new homes for the academic year.

   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said authorities will make use of the first discovery of dinosaur fossils in Hong Kong to attract more visitors, with officials planning to develop Port Island, where the bones were found, into a tourist attraction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials believe that more of these fossils might be found on the island in the northeastern waters of the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters before the Executive Council meeting, Lee said excavation work is ongoing on Port Island, which has geological features he described as “spectacular”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The discovery on Port Island is in the area of our Geopark... we actually have a very famous and spectacular spot, which is the volcanic hexagonal rock columns. And that is, I think, one of the strongest attractions for people who are interested in natural resources, natural heritage, and also enjoying the nature," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will be making use of this opportunity to develop some special tourist lines so that they can look at, first of all, the volcanic hexagonal rock columns, as well as all the other attractions of our Geopark, and including some exhibitions of the dinosaur fossils."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also said authorities will make use of the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre in Kowloon Park for workshops and exhibitions, and set up long-term displays for people to learn about paleontology.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who smashed a walk-off grand slam to win the opener in Los Angeles, crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and Walker Buehler threw five shutout innings allowing only two hits to spark the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gives the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Major League Baseball championship series, meaning they can capture their first crown since 2020 by winning game four on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman matched Hank Bauer in 1958 and Barry Bonds in 2002 as the only players to homer in the first three games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers first baseman also matched George Springer's record of homers in five consecutive World Series contests, including the last two games of Freeman's 2021 title run with Atlanta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not been swept in a World Series since Cincinnati did it in 1976. The most recent World Series sweep was by San Francisco over Detroit in 2012.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers seek their eighth World Series title while the Yankees, with a record 27 crowns, chase their first World Series title since 2009.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's the 12th title showdown between two of baseball's most iconic teams, with the Yankees having beaten the Dodgers eight times and the Dodgers defeating New York three, including a 1963 sweep. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's only female spaceflight engineer will be among a fresh crew of three astronauts that will travel to the Tiangong space station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shenzhou 19 crewmember Wang Haoze will become the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang was introduced on Tuesday along with her fellow crewmates Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center before their scheduled blast off at 4.27am on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m full ready for the mission,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I would devote all my energy and focus and attention to this mission. Together with my colleagues we are about to explore the universe and space. With every sunrise and sunset, we’d like to make them the landmarks of our journey to the universe.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Manned Space Agency said the Shenzhou 19 team will carry out their mission before returning to Earth in "late April or early May next year".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many duties await the new crew including science and application tests, and installing protective devices against space debris. Wang said she was looking forward to conducting these tasks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I also would like to fly around in space and also wave towards the stars. I would also like to look back from space to see our planet Earth and our motherland.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xinhua News Agency said the Shenzhou-19 crew will complete an in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-18 trio and stay at the space station for about six months. During this time, they will witness the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and the Shenzhou-20 crewed spaceship and even celebrate the Lunar New Year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Song Lingdong said he wanted to send a special Spring Festival greeting from space.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “For my first visit to space, I have this privilege to celebrate this important festival for Chinese people in space and on Earth. We can share the same moment of celebration and we can also send greetings for the Lunar New Year from space.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Tiangong space station is the crown jewel of the nation's space programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has ramped up plans to achieve its space dream, with Beijing saying it aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    'Sports arbitration body would save time and money'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A sports figure has welcomed the Justice Department's plan to set up a pilot scheme for a sports dispute resolution system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The idea was first unveiled in the recent Policy Address and comes amid a rise in the complexity of sports disputes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ronnie Wong, who chairs the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, said the move could save clubs time and money.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said the arbitrators should meet certain criteria.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First, they shouldn't have any conflict of interest with the cases that they're dealing with. Second, they must have experience in handling disputes related to the particular sports involved," Wong said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It would be better if it's something that they've done in the past, and they understand the sports."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said his association would be open to joining the pilot scheme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong Law Society president Roden Tong suggested on the same programme that the arbitration be carried out online, adding that the fees "wouldn't be a problem" for those involved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Basically the costs are very low, to the point that some [people] don't even charge a fee. For simple disputes, for example, some athletes may be very busy, or some associations don't have the time to come out and meet the parties involved," he said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the authorities will continue to hold test events at the new Kai Tak Sports Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said officials will learn from the experience of the first test run at the park last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said a second test event will be held at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, with a trial planned in the main 50,000-seat stadium in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The challenge of course is the dispersal of crowds after an event which will comprise of 50,000 spectators. That is a challenge we must take up boldly," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That is also why I have been demanding different levels of drills, so as to test different elements of operational procedures, different areas of risks, and also to learn about the experiences of those who may eventually become the final spectators of the 50,000 audience."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee added that the government will draw up various contingency plans, including on how to deal with unstable weather and emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The park is due to officially open in the first quarter of next year.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paolo Banchero had the best night of his career on Monday night, tying the Orlando Magic record for points in a half – scoring 37 in the first two quarters against the Indiana Pacers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He finished with a career-high 50 points to equal the fifth-highest scoring effort in Magic history. Orlando won 119-115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Man, I'm tired.” Banchero said after the first 50-point effort in the NBA this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero, the league's rookie of the year two seasons ago and an All-Star last year, was 13 of 17 from the field in the half and finished 16 of 26 from the floor. He also had 13 rebounds and nine assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It was just being in the zone,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Felt like I was in an open gym, back at home, just working on my game," he added. "Every shot felt like it was going in, and it's a good feeling when you've got a day like that. Not every game is going to be like that – but I'm glad today was.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37 points in the half tied the mark set by NBA legend Tracy McGrady, also in the first half, for Orlando against Washington in the game where he finished with 62.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That first half was a magical first half, for sure,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero's career-high entering Monday was 43 points, set January 3 against Sacramento. (AP)

    Rodri wins men's Ballon d'Or as Real Madrid boycott

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri was awarded the men's Ballon d'Or on Monday after winning a fourth consecutive Premier League title and Euro 2024, but Real Madrid boycotted the ceremony.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The decision to award the prize for the world's best player to the deep-lying midfielder came as a surprise, with Real Madrid's Liga and Champions League double winner Vinicius Junior widely seen as the pre-ceremony favourite.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours before the festivities in Paris, the Spanish club announced its delegation would not attend the ceremony at Chatelet Theatre because of what it perceived as a snub of Vinicius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodri, 28, played a key role as City held off Arsenal to win the Premier League title last season and was named player of the tournament at Euro 2024 as unfancied Spain emerged triumphant in Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite the French organisers insisting that the identity of the winner was a closely-guarded secret this year, the news appeared to have leaked with Madrid announcing hours before the ceremony they would not attend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati earlier won her second successive women's Ballon d'Or, after leading her club to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claiming the Nations League with her country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drama started hours before the ceremony as Spanish and European champions Real said if Vinicius was not the winner, then the award should go to his teammate Dani Carvajal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Like the Brazilian, Carvajal scored in the 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final at Wembley.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If the award criteria doesn't give it to Vinicius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to Carvajal as the winner," Real Madrid told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or and Uefa does not respect Real Madrid – Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Madrid contingent of nominees also included Kylian Mbappé, Antonio Rudiger, Fede Valverde and Jude Bellingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the Ballon d'Or is chosen from the shortlist by an international jury of 100 specialist journalists. (AFP)

    Philadelphia prosecutor sues Musk group over giveaways

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776613_1_20241029032140.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The district attorney of Philadelphia said on Monday that he has filed a lawsuit to halt Elon Musk's US$1 million giveaways as part of his political organisation's effort boosting Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The suit by Democratic District Attorney Larry Krasner is the first legal action to be brought over the sweepstakes offering US$1 million every day until November 5 to a person in a battleground state who has signed a petition supporting the Constitution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Krasner's office said the lawsuit, coming just over a week before Election Day, doesn't preclude potential criminal action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The Philadelphia District Attorney is charged with protecting the public from public nuisances and unfair trade practices, including illegal lotteries. The DA is also charged with protecting the public from interference with the integrity of elections,” Krasner's office said in a statement published on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A spokesperson for the billionaire tech mogul's America PAC (political action committee), emailed for comment on the lawsuit and asked if the cash awards would continue, responded with a link to an X post, which showed the latest US$1 million winner holding an oversized check.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Delaware after casting his ballot Monday, US President Joe Biden called the giveaway “totally inappropriate.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Musk's giveaway requires entrants to sign a petition backing the First and Second Amendments of the Constitution and calls for them to serve as spokespeople for the organization as a condition of winning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The awards have carried on after election law experts raised questions that it violates federal law barring anyone from paying a person to vote or register to vote.
   <br/>

    Thousands protest in Georgia after disputed vote

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tens of thousands of Georgians massed outside parliament on Monday night, demanding the annulment of the weekend parliamentary election that the president denounced as rigged with the help of Russia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rally deepened the political crisis in the South Caucasus country, where the governing Georgian Dream party has become increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “You did not lose the election,” President Salome Zourabichvili told the demonstrators who waved Georgian and European Union flags. “They stole your vote and tried to steal your future, but no one has the right to do that and you will not let anyone do that!”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giorgi Vashadze, leader of United National Movement coalition, said the opposition won't take part in any talks with the government and push for a new vote under international supervision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are not going to enter this parliament. We refuse all mandates,” he said. “We are not going to enter into any negotiations. We are going to fight until victory and we promise you, we will definitely win together.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Natia Chachava, who was wrapped in the Georgian flag, said the demonstrators “don’t want Russia, we don’t want to back to Russia or back to the Soviet Union.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU, the United States and NATO have all called for a full investigation of alleged irregularities in the Georgian election on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Georgian Dream and the electoral commission said the vote was free and fair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Central Election Commission said the Georgian Dream party received 54.8 percent of the vote with almost all ballots counted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kremlin on Monday denied any Russian interference in the vote, saying it was the West, not Moscow, that was trying to destabilise the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We aren’t meddling in Georgia’s internal affairs, and we have no intention of meddling,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He countered that it was the West that had tried to influence the vote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Parliament speaker Shalva Papuashvili, a member of Georgian Dream, accused the president of creating “a coup scenario” that goes “against the constitutional order and democratic elections.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU suspended Georgia’s membership application process indefinitely because of a Russian-style “foreign influence law” passed in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many Georgians viewed Saturday’s vote as a pivotal referendum on the opportunity to join the EU. (Agencies)

   Wall Street stocks climbed on Monday at the start of a heavy week of earnings and economic data, while markets also monitor the finale of the US presidential campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts pointed to a pullback in oil prices as supportive of equities even though US Treasury yields pushed higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's just a continuation of good economic news," said Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer of FNBO, pointing to broadly higher earnings so far and expectations for additional easing of US monetary policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.7 percent at 42,387.57.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 4,823.52, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 0.3 percent to 18,567.78.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Markets are eyeing the earnings reports of major tech companies this week including Apple, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Others reporting results include McDonald's, ExxonMobil and Pfizer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US government will also be releasing its third quarter GDP growth estimate this week, as well as its monthly labour market report -- closely watched for its bearing on the central bank's interest rate policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, aviation giant Boeing, which announced a stock offering that is expected to raise up to $19 billion, saw its shares slide 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing last week reported a major quarterly loss and has been reeling from a workers' strike. (AFP)

    Starmer takes on critics as tax rises loom

  <img alt="Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during an event in Birmingham. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776600_1_20241028220117.jpg&q=99" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said taxes needed to rise to rebuild public services and fix the foundations of the economy, and challenged critics to spell out how they would tackle the country's "unprecedented" problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Wednesday, finance minister Rachel Reeves will set out her first tax and spending plans which must address a difficult fiscal picture without raising major taxes on workers, cutting spending in priority departments or spooking investors with excessive borrowing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer, whose Labour Party won a landslide election victory in July, said in a speech on Monday that tough trade-offs were needed to "fix the foundations" of the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to be realistic about where we are as a country... These are unprecedented circumstances," he said, noting his government, unlike its predecessors in 1997 and 2010, had to deal with both a weak economy and poor public services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But I won't offer it as an excuse. I expect to be judged on my ability to deal with this," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Labour would borrow to drive growth and increase taxes to "prevent austerity and rebuild public services", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government is looking to find around 40 billion pounds in tax rises and spending cuts to address the fiscal gap while putting more money into areas like health and education.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he rejected the "fiction you can lower taxes (and) spend more on public services without making any changes".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shortly after the election, Reeves said the fiscal situation was worse than thought due to a 22 billion-pound (US$28.5 billion) black hole she said she had inherited from the previous Conservative government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reeves has said she will change the definition of public debt in the government's fiscal rules to allow it to borrow more to invest in the hope of speeding up economic growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have to move to a situation where we invest in the future of this country," Starmer said. "I do not accept the proposition that it will have an impact on interest rates."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said 240 million pounds would be spent on helping people back into work, and a two pound cap on bus fares would be replaced by a three pound cap next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Much of the build-up to the budget has been dominated by a debate over the definition of "working people".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government has pledged not to raise social security contributions paid by employees, but critics say working people might still bear the cost if the government increases the contributions paid by employers instead, or raises taxes on their savings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starmer said he was prepared to have a debate about the definition of working people but his chief concern was that there was "no more tax in their payslip."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conservatives have challenged the new government's assessment of the public finances, saying they are a pretext for tax rises that Labour had been planning already. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The social media network X on Monday suspended an account that published Hebrew-language messages on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, just days after it was opened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The account had a short notice reading "X suspends accounts which violate the X Rules," though the Elon Musk-owned platform did not specify which rule had been violated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei's office runs several social network accounts in his name, broadcasting messages in different languages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hebrew-language account had launched on the weekend with a message that is a common greeting in the Islamic world: "In the name of Allah, the Benevolent, the Most Merciful."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was opened after Israel carried out air strikes against military sites in Iran on Saturday in response to Tehran's missile attack on October 1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least four Iranian soldiers were killed in the attack which Iran said caused "limited damage" to a few radar systems. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The trial of French actor Gerard Depardieu on sexual assault charges opened on Monday in the absence of the celebrity, who had declared himself to be ill.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His lawyer, Jeremie Assous, had said earlier that Depardieu, 75, was "extremely affected" by ill health, and that he had asked for proceedings to be delayed until he could attend in person.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unfortunately his doctors have forbidden him from appearing here today," the lawyer said on arrival for the trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said would ask the court for a six-month suspension of the trial, which comes after numerous other complaints and with a possible second court case already lying in wait.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's version of the #MeToo movement, triggered in 2017 by allegations against US producer Harvey Weinstein.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu faces charges of abuse that allegedly occurred during a 2021 film shoot. The names of the two women accusing him have not been made public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of the plaintiffs, a set dresser now aged 55, reported in February that she had suffered sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults while filming director Jean Becker's "Les Volet Verts" ("The Green Shutters") in a private house in Paris.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect the justice system to be the same for everybody and for monsieur Depardieu not to receive special treatment just because he's an artist," the plaintiff's lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Assous said that Depardieu's defence would offer "witnesses and evidence that will show he has simply been targeted by false accusations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He accused the plaintiff of attempting to "make money" by claiming 30,000 euros (US$32,500) in compensation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff told French investigative website Mediapart that Depardieu had started loudly calling for a cooling fan during the shoot because he "couldn't even get it up" in the heat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She claimed the actor went on to boast that he could "give women an orgasm without touching them".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plaintiff alleged that an hour later she was "brutally grabbed" by Depardieu as she was walking off the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The actor pinned her by "closing his legs" around her before groping her waist and her stomach, continuing up to her breasts, she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu made "obscene remarks" during the incident, she said, including: "Come and touch my big parasol. I'll stick it in your pussy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She described the actor's bodyguards dragging him away as he shouted: "We'll see each other again, my dear".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My client expects that the justice system will find Gerard Depardieu to be a serial sexual assaulter," Durrieu-Diebolt said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second plaintiff in Monday's case, an assistant director on the same film, also alleges sexual violence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anouk Grinberg, an actor who appeared in "The Green Shutters", told AFP that Depardieu had used "salacious words... from morning till night".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When producers hired Depardieu to work on a film, they knew they were hiring an assaulter," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Grinberg said that in her experience, Depardieu had "always used sexual, smutty language" -- but that his behaviour had become "much, much worse, with permission from his profession, that pays him for it and covers up his offences".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 20 women have now accused Depardieu of various sexual offences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Actor Charlotte Arnould was the first to file a criminal complaint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A judge has yet to rule on a request from prosecutors in August for Depardieu to stand trial for raping and sexually assaulting her.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An investigation is also underway in Paris after a former production assistant accused Depardieu of a 2014 sexual assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And actor Helene Darras filed a sexual assault complaint that fell foul of the statute of limitations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish writer and journalist Ruth Baza has accused Depardieu of raping her in 1995.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Never, but never, have I abused a woman," Depardieu wrote in an open letter published in conservative daily Le Figaro in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weeks later, President Emmanuel Macron shocked feminists by complaining of a "manhunt" targeting Depardieu, who he called a "towering actor" who "makes France proud".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Macron's remarks followed the broadcast by an investigative TV show of a recording of Depardieu making repeated misogynistic and insulting remarks about women.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Depardieu is the biggest star to face accusations in French cinema's #MeToo movement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Directors Jacques Doillon and Benoit Jacquot are among the other major figures accused of sexual violence. (AFP)

    Agitator Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A UK judge on Monday jailed far-right agitator Tommy Robinson for 18 months after he admitted committing contempt of court over a long-running libel case involving a Syrian refugee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sentence is the latest jail term for one of Britain's most prominent anti-Muslim activists, who is blamed for helping fuel anti-immigration riots earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Robinson -- whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon -- pleaded guilty earlier on Monday to 10 breaches of a 2021 High Court order.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It bars the 41-year-old far-right figurehead from repeating false allegations he had made about the Syrian refugee, who successfully sued him for libel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Handing down the 18-month jail sentence at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, judge Jeremy Johnson said Robinson's actions were a "planned, deliberate, direct, flagrant breach of the court's orders".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nobody is above the law. Nobody can pick and choose which injunctions they obey and those they do not," the judge added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is in the interests of the whole community that injunctions are obeyed."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, wearing a grey suit and waistcoat with no tie, was held in custody, as some of his supporters looked on in court.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had turned himself in to police on Friday, after an arrest warrant was issued following his failure to appear for a July court hearing on the case.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawyers for the Solicitor General, a senior government post advising on legal matters and which pursues such cases, said during the hearing that Robinson had been "thumbing his nose at the court".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It accused him of "undermining" the rule of law, including by last year helping to publish a film called "Silenced", which contains the libellous allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The film remains pinned to the top of Robinson's profile on the social media site X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former football hooligan, who helped form the now-defunct far-right English Defence League in 2009, had landed himself back in court because of his "principles", his lawyers argued.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who brands himself as a free speech advocate, has previously served time for contempt of court, which is not a crime but can be sanctioned with a jail term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also has several criminal convictions, including for assault.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, thousands of his supporters and other protesters marched through central London demanding his release, as well as tougher immigration laws.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Robinson, who has reportedly spent recent months outside the UK, has amassed a large online following built around his vehemently anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant messaging.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Demonstrators at anti-immigrant riots which erupted across England and Northern Ireland in late July and early August could be heard chanting his name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was widely condemned for a stream of social media posts during the week of violence, which was sparked by false rumours that the suspect behind the fatal stabbings of three young girls was a Muslim asylum seeker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has been a familiar sight at far-right rallies over the years, but has seen his profile grow over the last year after his X account was reinstated following billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of the platform. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Some 6,000 people arrested but not charged during the 2019 protests could live normally, Secretary for Justice Paul Lam has stressed, while dismissing suggestions on setting a time limit for prosecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In newspaper interviews published on Monday, Lam said individuals under investigation for their acts during the social unrest were not bound by any restrictions, and could exercise their freedoms like anyone else.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The justice chief shot down calls to stop pursuing suspects after a certain period of time, clarifying there's no time limit on prosecution for "serious criminal cases".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Setting a deadline, he added, would be "inconsistent" with the principle of the rule of law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our decision to prosecute is based on existing evidence. But there were instances in the past...where there could be changes in circumstances or the emergence of new evidence in the future that's unknown to us, which might make it necessary to re-examine the prosecution decision," Lam explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His views were echoed by security minister Chris Tang, who was asked the same topic in a media interview on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dropping prosecution after a certain period of time, he said, was like "making things that are illegal lawful".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Unless the law stipulates a time limit, we will initiate prosecution when there's evidence," Tang said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former police chief denied it was unfair to keep arrested individuals waiting for years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would only be wrong, he said, if law enforcement agencies have sufficient evidence but choose not to prosecute swiftly.

    Man Utd sack Ten Hag, reportedly set to appoint Amorim

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag, the Premier League club said on Monday, with the Old Trafford side 14th in the standings after nine games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men’s first-team manager," the club said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 54-year-old Dutchman's job was the subject of speculation for most of last season as United recorded their worst Premier League finish in eighth, and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, however, plus the fact Ten Hag was able to blame numerous injuries for their poor form earned Ten Hag another chance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He signed a new contract to extend his stay until 2026 and get another chance to restore the 20-times English league champions to former glories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Early results this season, however, suggested Ten Hag was not going to achieve that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to multiple British media reports, United will turn to Amorim, the 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon manager who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Sports reported United were prepared to pay Amorim's release clause.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe kept him on board following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the Premier League but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year extension of his contract to June 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But United have shown little improvement this season and the 2-1 loss at West Ham was the final straw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager," a statement by United read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future," it added. (Reuters/AFP)

    HKO seeks HK$55m for new radar system

  <img alt="The Hong Kong Observatory wants HK$55 million from the Legislative Council for a new weather radar system. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776578_1_20241028175838.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) is hoping to set up a new radar system to better monitor and predict severe weather across the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The "phased array weather radar system" would provide detailed weather images that update quickly, helping to detect fast-changing weather conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environment and Ecology Bureau is seeking funding approval from Legco for HK$55 million to buy three sets of the radars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco panel meeting on Monday, Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the system would benefit the development of a low-altitude economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Weather of course is important when it comes to low-altitude flying. This radar system could detect weather changes up to a few hundred metres above ground, So the weather radar system will help to enhance the safety of low-altitude vehicles and devices," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Together with an existing one in Sha Lo Wan, the proposed new radars in Cheung Chau, Lau Fau Shan and Tung Lung Chau would cover the whole territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to monitor "ionospheric scintillation" which affects drones, HKO's assistant director Chan Sai-tick said the observatory is using space weather data from the mainland and other countries and looking for ways to track ionosphere changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan added that the new radars offer higher resolution and faster updates, allowing more accurate predictions of severe weather such as hail and tornadoes.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific on Monday relaunched direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan taking the first flight servicing the two cities since the route was suspended in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flag carrier will operate three flights per week, as authorities push for more cooperation with Middle East countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan who was aboard flight CX647 is leading a delegation of over 100 representatives from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This symbolises a more frequent and direct people-to-people flow and also trade and cargo flow between the two regions. Cathay Pacific will be increasing its services to this region,” he said before boarding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “[We are] opening up new markets, attracting new sources of capital, new sources of investment. This is an important move.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cathay’s chief customer and commercial officer, Lavinia Lau, said the carrier’s aim was to reach 100 worldwide destinations by next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She said Cathay received a good response from travellers on the resumption of direct flights to Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The booking is pretty promising, at least for the first few flights… but going forward, we are also seeing a variety of travellers on our flights,” Lau said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some of them originating from Hong Kong, a lot actually coming back from the other side, Saudi Arabia, to Hong Kong to visit, or going via Hong Kong to places like Japan to visit. We also see good traffic flows from Southeast Asia, via Hong Kong to Riyadh.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another passenger on the flight to Riyadh was Nelson. The startup worker said flying direct was much more convenient.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Last time, I think we had to change from Qatar, so this is really convenient for us. It’s a direct flight. The difference is, first of all, time, and also it’s more convenient for business,” he told RTHK.

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A newly approved hostel project for young Hongkongers has started taking applications, with the first batch of tenants expected to move in as early as December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the government gave the green light for the Regal Oriental Hotel in Kowloon City to be partially converted into a youth hostel named “YOT Hub”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Non-governmental organisation Yan Oi Tong will take ownership of 80 rooms, accommodating up to 160 adults under 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hostel tenants will be asked to take part in 200 hours of activities each year, such as training courses and trips to other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry Cheng, who chairs the organisation’s board of directors, said on Monday that tenants can choose what activities to join.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The goal to organise these activities is to broaden their horizon and for their personal development,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “National education is just one of them. We are looking to take them to the Greater Bay Area, to different enterprises, to let them know how the country has changed, as China has grown quite substantially for the last 10 years.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Employed individuals who meet the income and asset requirements can make single-person applications to be matched with a roommate, or apply as a pair for the same unit.

   As of 4pm on Monday, the project had received about 110 applications, according to the charitable organisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The youth hostel will initially run for three years, with tenants signing a two-year contract.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Cyberport CEO Peter Yan has been appointed as Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government made the announcement on Monday following an open recruitment exercise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unveiled in the 2022 Policy Address, OASES aims to attract high-potential and representative enterprises to Hong Kong from industries including fintech, AI and data science.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yan will assume office on Tuesday and has left his role as a member of the board of directors of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has worked in the technology field for over 39 years and held various senior management positions in large consulting and information technology services companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a statement that Yan has rich experience and extensive knowledge in the field of information technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am confident that Mr Yan will lead OASES in attracting more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, thereby contributing to the city's innovation and technology development as well as its economic upgrading and transformation," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Herbert Chia has taken the spot on the HKEX board vacated by Yan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chia is chairman of the data governance advisory committee of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and a venture partner of Sequoia Capital China.

    S Korea's Tom Kim sets sights on HK Open prize

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korean phenom Tom Kim on Monday said he is feeling confident ahead of his return to the Link Hong Kong Open in November, for the first time since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing," said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into," Kim said. "And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come," he added.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said on Sunday that “no one can sit on the sidelines” in this year's presidential election, capping a day of campaigning across the largest city in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We are focused on the future and we are focused on the needs of the American people," Harris said, "as opposed to Donald Trump, who spends full time looking in the mirror focused on himself.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a city recreation centre, the US Vice President singled out young voters, praising them for being “rightly impatient for change," and told the audience that “there is too much at stake” in the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We must not wake up the day after the election and have any regret about what we could have done in these next nine days," Harris said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energising voters in Philadelphia, a traditional Democratic stronghold, is crucial for Harris’ chances of beating Republican presidential candidate Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If turnout falls short here, she will struggle to overcome her opponent's advantages in the state's rural areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Trump hosted a rally featuring crude and racist insults at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With just over a week before Election Day, speakers at the New York rally labelled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and called Harris “the devil”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” said Tony Hinchcliffe, a stand-up comic whose set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election just nine days away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His joke was immediately criticised by Harris’ campaign as it competes with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puerto Rican music superstar Bad Bunny backed Harris shortly after Hinchcliffe's appearance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The normally pugnacious Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing itself from Hinchcliffe. “
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign," senior adviser Danielle Alvarez said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But other speakers also made incendiary comments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trump’s childhood friend David Rem referred to Harris as “the Antichrist” and “the devil" while businessman Grant Cardone told the crowd that Harris' handlers "will destroy our country.” (AP)

    LDP heavyweight resigns after Japan election drubbing

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The election committee chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) resigned on Monday after the party suffered its worst result since 2009, a party official said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister, submitted a letter of resignation, the official said, with media reports quoting him as saying he wanted to "take responsibility" for the result.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling coalition lost a majority in the 465-seat lower house in a snap parliamentary election held on Sunday, a punishment by voters' outrage over the governing party’s extensive financial scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba's LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All told, the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held, according to Japanese media.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba took office on October 1 and immediately ordered the election in hopes of shoring up support after his predecessor, Fumio Kishida , failed to address public outrage over the LDP’s scandals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The results so far have been extremely severe, and we take them very seriously," Ishiba told Japan's national NHK television late Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I believe the voters are telling us to reflect more and become a party that lives up to their expectations."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba said the LDP would still lead a ruling coalition and tackle key policies, compile a planned supplementary budget and pursue political reform.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He indicated that his party is open to cooperating with opposition groups if that suits the public's expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said. (Agencies)

    Govt announces AI policy statement for finance market

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government delivered a policy statement on Monday on the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the finance market, saying it is addressing challenges the technology brings and encouraging its development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the statement, the administration said it is both open and prudent towards the application of AI, while saying it wants the sector to use it in a responsible manner, noting issues such as cybersecurity and intellectual property rights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said officials will closely monitor market developments and draw on experiences on the mainland and overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the government will promote the use of AI in finance to accelerate the development of new quality productive forces tailored to Hong Kong's conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We consider it appropriate to adopt a dual-track model to AI. We will continue to encourage the adoption of AI to capture opportunities, while assessing its associated risks from time to time and mitigate them," the minister said during a speech at Hong Kong Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the University of Science and Technology will allow financial firms to use its AI language model, called InvestLM.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[The university is] going to make their model available for use, not just for the big firms, but also the small firms in the financial services sector, including accounting and others, in such a way that they can try for themselves how AI can improve their work processes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hui added that around 38 percent of institutions in the local financial sector use AI, about 12 percentage points higher than the global average.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the policy statement, the government added that it thinks the use of AI in finance is data-driven and dynamic, yet also double-edged in that it has both potential and risks. It said AI is a tool and shouldn't replace human judgement and analysis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Financial institutions should formulate an AI governance strategy to provide direction on how AI systems should be implemented and used. A risk-based approach should be adopted in the procurement, use and management of AI systems and human oversight will be crucial to mitigating the potential risks," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government said risks posed by the technology have been suitably reflected in relevant regulations and guidelines issued by financial regulators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials also said the police have been exchanging intelligence with their overseas counterparts and the AI industry to address the cyber policing challenges posed by AI.

    'More considered discussion on student suicide needed'

  <img alt="A concern group says there should be more considered discussion of student suicides following a backlash over a scholar's remarks on the issue. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776522_1_20241028115226.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Monday called for more considered and respectful discussion of student suicides, after a scholar's remarks on the issue sparked a backlash.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It came after Professor Ricky Tse, who is with the Life Education Centre of Hong Kong Nang Yan College of Higher Education, said students wouldn't kill themselves if they thought more about social responsibility and parental expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse also suggested life education such as watching chicks hatch would prevent students from "doing anything stupid".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Heather Yeung from the Hong Kong Student Alliance on Student Suicide, said blaming the students was not helpful.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pointing the finger at students for their 'wrong values' is not good. The reasons for student suicide are complex and can't be explained by just one cause," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We should not attribute suicidal behaviour solely to students' personal values, because it overlooks the influence of other factors."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Paul Yip, head of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, told the same programme that student suicides should be addressed carefully.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said terms like "doing stupid things" - commonly used in Chinese to refer to taking one's life - should be avoided because they can be interpreted as blame or dismissal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The World Health Organisation has said we should not stigmatise suicide. So I always encourage young people: 'It's okay not to be okay.' As long as you're willing to take a step forward and seek help, the help is available," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RTHK has reached out to Professor Tse for a response.

   The Philippines raised a fresh weather alert on Monday, days after more than 100 people were killed by the country’s worst storm of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nearly a million people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after losing their homes or being driven out by floodwaters brought by Severe Tropical Storm Trami, which struck from October 22.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's weather agency says Tropical Storm Kong-rey will strengthen into a typhoon by Tuesday and pass close to the northern Philippines as early as Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lowest of a five-stage storm alert is in place on the country's northeast coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami, by contrast, struck some of the country's most populous areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government's disaster agency put the death toll from Trami at 116, with 39 missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Philippines or its surrounding waters each year, damaging homes and infrastructure and killing dozens of people. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Washington rookie Jayden Daniels completed a stunning 52-yard touchdown pass on Sunday's final play to give the Commanders a shocking 18-15 victory over Chicago while the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs stayed unbeaten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, questionable until game time with a rib injury, scrambled to evade defenders then hurled the ball half the field to the goal line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bears defender Tyrique Stevenson tipped it from among a pack of players and into the end zone, where Noah Brown caught it for an astonishing "Hail Mary" game-winning touchdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was juiced up for sure. It was exciting," Daniels said. "That's like a once-in-a-lifetime experience – that was my first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just threw the ball up," he added. "I didn't see anything. I just heard people screaming and our sidelined rushing the field – that's how I knew."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, who completed 21-of-38 passes for 326 yards, called it a miraculous play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Las Vegas, Patrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to spark the unbeaten Chiefs over the host Raiders 27-20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chiefs became the seventh reigning Super Bowl champion to start the next campaign 7-0, the first since New England in 2019. Only Denver in 1998 managed to win another title after those starts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We played a pretty good game," Mahomes said. "We're building and going in the right direction."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the NFL's play of the season was by Daniels, who was feeling rib pain near the end of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's tough when you've got to throw the ball, have to rotate with it," Daniels said. "I started the game. I wanted to finish it – nothing was going to take me out of the game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders grabbed a 12-0 lead but Chicago seized the lead on a touchdown with 23 seconds remaining, only to fall on an incredible play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's a hard way to lose," Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. "I've got to look at it, detail it out, and make sure we're better next time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders stayed atop the NFC East at 6-2. Chicago fell to 4-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brown was overjoyed after catching the NFL's first go-ahead "Hail Mary" touchdown pass in the last 10 seconds of a game since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got a team full of fighters," Brown said. "We don't give up until the final whistle. "Just try and get down there as fast as you can, get good position, hope Jayden can get the ball down there." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Sainz cruised to an emotional victory for Ferrari ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in Sunday's incident-filled Mexico City Grand Prix as Red Bull's series leader Max Verstappen was handed two 10-second penalties on his way to sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The stewards took a dim view of Verstappen's aggressive driving, the Red Bull driver twice forcing his title rival Norris off the track.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris grabbed second from Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari near the finish as the Briton enjoyed a major boost in his quest to deny Verstappen a fourth consecutive world championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The McLaren driver cut 10 points off the gap to Verstappen which now stands at 47 with four race weekends remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I knew what to expect from Max," Verstappen said, speaking on the heavy price for his show of ruthlessness. "I respect him a lot as a driver and I expected it but it was not very clean driving in my opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second week in succession that the two title-chasers had clashed following a penalty for Norris at the United States Grand Prix. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United's under-fire manager Erik ten Hag said he could only fault his side's finishing after a damaging 2-1 defeat for the Dutchman at struggling West Ham on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United slipped to 14th in the Premier League table after Jarrod Bowen's controversial stoppage time penalty winner handed the Hammers all three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crysencio Summerville put West Ham in front against the run of play 16 minutes from time before Casemiro equalised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was furious at the award of the spot-kick after VAR intervened when Matthijs de Ligt clashed with Danny Ings inside the box.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United captain Bruno Fernandes had a red card rescinded after being sent-off in a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham last month and Ten Hag highlighted the inconsistency of when VAR decides to challenge the referee's on-field decision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the season they explained the process of VAR – only when it is clear and obvious they should interfere," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What they didn't do against Spurs, that was a wrong decision," he added. "Now they make a wrong decision interfering and both have big impact on the games. I don't criticise the personnel, I criticise the process."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it was a familiar lack of wastefulness in front of goal that cost United a much-needed victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diogo Dalot missed an open goal, while Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes were also guilty of missing huge chances in a dominant first-half display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created so many chances, played so good football, especially in the first half. How I want my team to play in and out of possession," added Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United's return of eight goals from their first nine games is their worst in the Premier League era.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag's men have won just three of those matches and drawn all three of their opening games in the Europa League to leave their manager clinging on to his job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he claimed to have seen positive signs in a 2-1 win over Brentford last weekend and a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce prior to their visit to the London Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this moment the luck is definitely not on our side. Last season was not different and near the end we turned it around," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are so determined it will be the same this season," he added. "We have to turn this around and it will turn around if we keep playing like we are now." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mohamed Salah's equaliser salvaged Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Premier League title rivals Arsenal on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool began the weekend on top after winning 11 of their opening 12 games in all competitions under Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a draw sees the Reds fall one point behind Manchester City at the top of the table, with Arsenal now five points adrift of the leaders in third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're in the business where you can be on top one week and then not," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We are in October and let's see what it brings us at the end of the season. Enjoy the ride."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bukayo Saka recovered from a hamstring injury to start for Arsenal and gave the home side the perfect start with a stunning touch and finish from Ben White's pass on nine minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Van Dijk quickly levelled from a corner, but Arsenal led again before half-time through Mikel Merino's header.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool improved after the break and got their reward when Darwin Nunez teed up Salah for his eighth goal of the season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Credit to Liverpool – we feel like we didn't play the full 90 minutes," said Saka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First half we showed our qualities, gave them nothing and they scored from a set piece," he added. "I can't think of another chance they had. Second half we weren't at our best." (AFP)

  <img alt="With almost all seats accounted for, Japanese media say Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition secured 214 seats, down from the 279 it previously held.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition has lost its majority after snap elections, Japanese media projected early on Monday, in what would be a major blow to new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba, 67, called Sunday's election only days after taking office on October 1, aiming to bolster his position and that of his scandal-hit Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost continuously for seven decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But national broadcaster NHK and other media outlets reported in the hours after polls closed that the LDP – in the party's worst result since 2009 – together with its long-term junior coalition partner Komeito had fallen short of the 233 seats needed for a majority in Japan's lower house.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters in the world's fourth-largest economy have been rankled by rising prices and the fallout from a party slush fund scandal that helped sink previous premier Fumio Kishida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP remains the top party in Japan's parliament, and a change of government is not expected. But the results create political uncertainty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Falling short of a majority makes it difficult for Ishiba to get his party’s policies through parliament, and he may need to find a third coalition partner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The LDP’s coalition retains a majority in the less powerful upper house. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the ruling coalition with junior partner Komeito secured 215 seats, down sharply from the majority of 279 it previously held.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are receiving severe judgement," Ishiba told NHK earlier on Sunday while it was still unclear whether the coalition would secure enough seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Voters "expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that will act in line with the people's will," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Footage from the LDP headquarters showed gloomy faces as projections based on exit polls indicated Ishiba's justice and agriculture ministers were likely to lose their seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, led by centrist leader Yoshihiko Noda, made huge gains to 148 seats, from its previous 98.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We accomplished our goal of preventing the ruling coalition from a majority, which was a major achievement,” Noda said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noda called the election a rare chance for a change of government, and said he seeks to lead a coalition with other opposition groups to do so. But his party has had trouble finding partners, and some voters were skeptical about the opposition’s ability and inexperience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Ishiba, potential additional partners include the Democratic Party of the People, which calls for lower taxes, and the conservative Japan Innovation Party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   DPP head Yuichiro Tamaki said he was open to “a partial alliance.” Innovation Party chief Nobuyuki Baba has denied any intention to cooperate. As of early Monday, DPP had 28 seats and the Innovation Party 38.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Experts say a CDPJ-led government is not in the picture because of its lack of viable policies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “If they take power and try to change the economic and diplomatic policies of the current government, they will only end up collapsing right away,” said Izuru Makihara, a University of Tokyo professor of politics and public policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Realistically, Ishiba's ruling coalition would seek a partnership with either the Innovation Party or the Democratic Party of the People”, he said. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Georgian opposition on Sunday called for protests and the European Union demanded an investigation into "irregularities" after a disputed legislative vote that showed a win for the ruling party.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili accused Moscow of being behind the alleged election fraud, calling it a "Russian special operation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amid angry opposition claims over the result, Zurabishvili called for a rally on Monday. Jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili also called for mass protests.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Union had warned that Saturday's vote could determine Tbilisi's chances of joining the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   EU council president Charles Michel wrote on X that Georgian authorities should "swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These alleged irregularities must be seriously clarified and addressed," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After meeting with opposition leaders in Tbilisi, Zurabishvili said there had been a "total falsification of the election".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are witnesses and victims of a Russian special operation, a modern form of hybrid war against the Georgian people," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International observers said Saturday's election was "marred by an uneven playing field, pressure and tension". An EU parliament mission also expressed concern about "democratic backsliding", saying it had seen instances of "ballot box stuffing" and the "physical assault" of observers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saakashvili said on Facebook that opposition lawmakers should renounce their parliamentary seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Now is the time for mass protests. We must show the world that we are fighting for freedom and that we are a people who will not tolerate injustice," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official tallies from more than 99 percent of precincts showed the ruling Georgian Dream party winning 54 percent of the vote, with the main pro-Western opposition coalition on 37.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result gives Georgian Dream 91 seats in the 150-member parliament – enough to govern but short of the supermajority it had sought to pass a constitutional ban on all main opposition parties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our victory is impressive," Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said in a statement, accusing the opposition of "undermining the country's constitutional order" by questioning his party's victory. (AFP)

    Iran mulls response as Israel says it hit Iran hard

  <img alt="Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Israel's attack on Iran should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776444_1_20241027180156.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Israel's airstrikes "hit hard" Iran's defences and missile production, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country was considering its response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With warfare raging in Gaza and Lebanon, direct confrontation between Israel and Iran risks spiralling into a regional conflagration. But a day after the airstrikes, there was no sign they would spark another round of escalation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, heavy fighting in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which sharply intensified over recent weeks, continued on Sunday with an Israeli airstrike killing eight people in a residential block in Sidon, medics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The air force attacked throughout Iran. We hit hard Iran's defence capabilities and its ability to produce missiles that are aimed at us," Netanyahu said in a speech, calling the attack "precise and powerful" and saying it met all its objectives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel’s army chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the strike on Iran had showed what the Israeli response to its enemies would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We struck strategic systems in Iran, which carries great importance, and we will now see how things develop. We are prepared for all scenarios in every arena.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Islamic Republic has not signalled how it will respond to Saturday's long-anticipated strikes, which involved scores of fighter jets bombing targets near the capital Tehran and in the western provinces of Ilam and Khuzestan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The heavily armed arch-enemies have engaged in a cycle of retaliatory moves against each other for months, with Saturday's strike coming after an Iranian missile barrage on Oct 1, much of which Israel said was downed by its air defences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Khamenei said Israel's calculations "should be disrupted".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The attack on Iran, which killed four soldiers and caused some damage, "should neither be downplayed nor exaggerated", he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran was not looking for war but would give an "appropriate response".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   US President Joe Biden called for a halt to escalation, which has raised fears of a wider Middle East war arising from the year-old Israeli-Hamas conflict in Gaza and Israel's thrust into south Lebanon to stop Hezbollah rocketing northern Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Iran was no longer able to use its allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon against Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The two groups "are no longer an effective tool" of Tehran, he said in a speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gallant added that Hamas was no longer functioning as a military network in Gaza and that Hezbollah's senior command and most of its missile capabilities had been eliminated.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hamas has repeatedly said it is still able to function militarily, and Israel has recently conducted major new operations in devastated north Gaza against what it calls regrouping Hamas militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah has said its command structure remains intact and that it retains significant missile capabilities. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Evo Morales is vying for the nomination of the ruling party in August 2025 presidential elections. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776469_1_20241028013441.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Bolivian president Evo Morales said gunmen fired a hail of bullets at his car Sunday as he travelled to a radio interview in the central city of Cochabamba, wounding his driver.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The car in which I arrived has 14 bullet holes," said Morales, adding: "This was planned. The idea was to kill Evo."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The radio station that hosted the interview, Kawsachun Coca, released a video that it said was of the bullet-ridden pickup truck that Morales had been in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The windshield had three bullet holes and the driver had blood on his head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales blamed the current president, Luis Arce, a former ally and cabinet minister of his with whom he has fallen out, for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Lucho has destroyed Bolivia and now he wants to eliminate our process by killing Evo," Morales, using the president's nickname, said of his own attempt to regain the presidency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales, a former coca grower who is now 65, served as president from 2006 until 2019. He was highly popular in the Andean country until he tried to bypass the constitution to seek a fourth term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was forced to resign after losing the support of the military following an election marked by allegations of fraud, and fled to Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales returned to Bolivia in 2020 seeking political resurrection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He and Arce are both vying for the nomination of the ruling MAS party in August 2025 presidential elections, although Morales is legally barred from running again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morales is being investigated for rape, human trafficking and human smuggling over his alleged sexual relationship with a 15-year-old member of his political youth guard in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Supporters of Morales have protested by blocking major roads throughout the country for two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, the government had criticised Morales for "destabilising" the country with two weeks of road blockades that have jammed up supplies of food and fuel around the country. It accused him of trying to "interrupt democratic order".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government in a statement also said some groups allied to Morales were armed and warned about violence, citing 14 police officers wounded trying to break up the blockades. (Agencies)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Francesco Bagnaia won the Thai MotoGP in wet conditions on Sunday to close the gap on championship leader Jorge Martin, who was second, with two race weekends left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spaniard Martin's lead over defending champion Bagnaia, of Italy, was cut from 22 points to 17, ahead of another chapter in their title tussle at Sepang in Malaysia next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pedro Acosta was third at a rainy Buriram, but this was all about Martin and Bagnaia, with the championship now a two-horse race and likely to go right down to the wire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Malaysia, the season finale is at Valencia on November 15-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pramac Ducati's Martin, who is trying to win the world crown for the first time, said he was happy to settle for second, coming home nearly three seconds behind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The level we are demonstrating -- not a lot of people can understand how fast we are going even in these conditions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia thanked his Ducati team for keeping his hopes of a third world title in a row alive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We did an incredible job. So, so happy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Martin began the race on the front row in third and made a lightning start to grab the lead from his pole-sitting rival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 26-year-old did not stay there long, running wide to fall to third as Bagnaia took the lead with six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez in hot pursuit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the halfway point of the 26-lap race it had developed to a duel between Bagnaia and Marquez, with Martin struggling to keep up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Marquez pushed too hard in trying to take the lead and slid off on his Ducati.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That left the title rivals to battle it out for victory, but Bagnaia held his nerve and handled the demanding conditions to see out a crucial ninth win of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia also started Saturday's sprint race on pole but ended up third, just behind Martin. Bagnaia's Ducati team-mate Enea Bastianini won the sprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Japan's Ai Ogura was crowned Moto2 world champion as he came second in a red-flagged race won by Spain's Aron Canet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23-year-old Ogura will move up to MotoGP next season. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Serbian Olga Danilovic powered past American qualifier Caroline Dolehide 6-3 6-1 in the Guangzhou Open final on Sunday to seal her first trophy of the season and second of her career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number 86 Danilovic, whose previous triumph came on clay in Moscow six years ago, grabbed a break in the fifth game of the first set in her maiden hardcourt final and overcame a late fightback from Dolehide to pull away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so happy with the way I played during the tournament," said Danilovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so proud of myself and my team. I really showed what I can do. I'm very excited to be finishing the season this way."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After wrapping up the opener with a second break, the 23-year-old appeared distracted by movement in the stands and surrendered her serve early in the second set, but responded strongly to build a 4-1 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danilovic peppered her fatigued opponent with powerful shots for a double break and closed out the match on serve, finishing with a blistering forehand winner before a huge serve on her third match point. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Japan's ruling coalition may fall short of a parliamentary majority, exit polls for Sunday's general election showed, raising uncertainty over the make-up of the government of the world's fourth-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by national broadcaster NHK showed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history, and junior coalition partner were set to win between 174 and 254 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is predicted to win 128 to 191 seats. The outcome may force the LDP or CDPJ into power-sharing agreements with other parties to form a government.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A poll by Nippon TV showed the ruling coalition would win 198 seats to the CDPJ's 157, both well short of the 233 seats needed to reach a majority, as voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a tough fight for the LDP," Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP's election chief, told NHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ishiba called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor Fumio Kishida quit after his support cratered due to anger over a cost of living crunch and a scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The uncertainty comes nine days before U.S. voters choose a new president and as Japan faces economic headwinds and increasingly tense relations with neighbouring China.
   <br/>
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Officials said about 20 more test events will be held before the Kai Tak Sports Park officially opens next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A local football league match which concluded at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Sunday was the first of a series of test events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 1,500 spectators turned up in the end, 50 percent more than the original estimate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game, featuring Second Division sides Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin, ended in a 2-2 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the overall arrangements were smooth, with most people making use of the MTR to arrive and leave the venue.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first batch of spectators were able to exit the stadium within six to seven minutes, reaching Sung Wong Toi station another few minutes later, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ultimate goal, officials said, is to host a test event with a full crowd of 50,000 people at the main stadium. The first such event at the core hub is scheduled for January next year, with about 10,000 spectators.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We start from a small scale, but gradually, we will arrange around 20 trial events, and then by that time, we will increase the number of people to up to 50,000," Chan explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are confident that with all these arrangements, all these preparations... we [would have] sufficiently tried everything before it officially opens."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports and culture minister Kevin Yeung said more transportation methods would be provided in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope people can mainly make use of the MTR, the mass transit system, when they leave the venue. But for test events which include more people, we will also arrange bus services, or special bus routes," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung added that questionnaires were distributed to attendees on Sunday, and their comments will be analysed to identity areas of improvement.

    Police to monitor Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween with CCTV

  <img alt="Police said 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed across Lan Kwai Fong ahead of Halloween this Thursday. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776448_1_20241027183843.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Police said on Sunday that a system which can analyse real-time foot traffic will be put to use for the first time at Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween, when revellers are expected to swarm the area to celebrate the festival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 25,000 people are estimated to turn up in the nightlife district on Thursday, similar to last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traffic arrangements will be implemented in phases from 2pm. Most roads in the vicinity will be closed to vehicles at night, and party-goers can only enter the area through D'Aguilar Street and exit from Wyndham Street.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Acting Superintendent Fung Chung-pang said CCTV signals will be streamed directly to police's command centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The CCTVs will provide real-time footage from various angles, allowing officers to understand the situation live.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force will also make use of a people-counting system to work out the crowd density at the scene through visual analysis. This will allow us to identify underlying safety risks, and to implement crowd management measures should they be needed," Fung said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers said a total of 50 sets of CCTVs have been installed in the area, as well as a public broadcast system to alert citizens in case of emergencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Taxi ambassadors will also roam the area to assist revellers to hail a cab home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police also warned anyone planning to dress up for the night not to carry any imitation firearm or offensive weapons to avoid falling foul of the law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They added that artificial intelligence technology may be used in the future to identify accidents or events at which police assistance is needed.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A truck driver rammed his vehicle into a crowd of people at a bus stop in central Israel on Sunday, injuring at least 24 people before he was "shot and neutralised", police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preliminary police findings showed the driver also hit a bus that had stopped at the same location to drop off passengers, the police said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 24 people were injured in the incident, police said, without clarifying whether it was an attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The force however said civilians at the site of the incident "shot the truck driver and neutralised him".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Sunday the Magen David Adom emergency service said the incident occurred at Aharon Yariv Boulevard in Ramat HaSharon, north of the commercial hub Tel Aviv.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Of those injured, at least 16 people had been transported to nearby hospitals, MDA said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officers and ambulances rushed to the scene, where Israeli television channels showed police cordoning off the area as medics helped the injured and a helicopter hovered above.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident comes as Israel holds ceremonies to mark the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the Hamas attack on October 7 last year that sparked the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. (AFP)

    Smooth sailing as football match goes ahead in Kai Tak

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A local football league match on Sunday kicked off a series of test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park before it officially opens in the first quarter of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities expected 1,000 spectators streamed into the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground for a Second Division League fixture between Sai Kung and Wong Tai Sin. Around 1,500 turned up in the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Stephen, an engineer who has worked on the Kai Tak project since five years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Pretty much a bit of professional pride, and proud of what we've built for Hong Kong," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] almost there. We're quite excited because it's been five years, and like any other construction projects, it's had its ups and downs. And now we can see it’s almost open."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator Ivy, who walked from Kowloon City to the stadium, said security was quite strict at the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But she was happy to attend the match and support her friend, who’s playing on one of the teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[It's] really exciting. It's huge… My friend is playing football here," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spectators were encouraged to get to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi - instead of Kai Tak - MTR station.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MTR Corporation said it had implemented special arrangements at both stations. Plenty of signs were put up pointing passengers to the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sports minister Kevin Yeung and sports commissioner George Tsoi were both spotted at the stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was security chief Chris Tang, who was happy with what he saw so far before the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everything is smooth. When people depart [from] the MTR, there’s sufficient announcements, as well as notice direction showing how they come here," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have adopted a phased approach, so at different stages, we have different [arrangements]. On this occasion, apart from making sure that it’s safe, it's also training to our frontline officers, so that's the reason why we are bringing extra officers to come here to make themselves familiar with the environment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another event has been scheduled at the Youth Sports Ground in mid-November, as Hong Kong Men's Rugby Team host Brazil for a two-match international series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second match will be played in Kai Tak, with an estimated attendance of 3,000 people.

    Subdivided unit residents fear losing their homes

  <img alt="The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers’ Group says rent of future subdivided flats may go up under a government initiative to wipe out inadequate housing. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776430_1_20241027160717.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A concern group on Sunday said residents of subdivided flats may be left homeless as the government proposed plans to put an end to inadequate housing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The chief executive announced plans in the Policy Address to eradicate substandard subdivided units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A future legislation will mandate the registration of such dwellings as "basic housing units". Each must be no less than eight square metres, or 86 square feet, in size, and fitted with an individual toilet and at least one window.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Units which fail to meet the set of standards will be outlawed. That could be a headache for tenants, who have to relocate elsewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Sham Shui Po Housing Concern Mothers' Group surveyed about 70 residents of subdivided flats following the announcement of the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About eight in 10 respondents said they wished to be directly allocated a public flat, instead of moving to temporary solutions such as light public housing, or transitional homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One of them was Amber, who was worried her landlord would evict them in the future because the unit had to be renovated in order to comply with the rules.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mother of two added possible rehousing plans by the authorities may not be suitable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even if they offer us a light public housing flat or transitional housing, I won't consider. The location is far. I'm not familiar with the new environment, and I don't want my children to transfer to another school," she explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another group member, Lily, feared paying higher rent since there's a minimum size for future units.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope they can build more public housing flats quickly. Some of us have waited for eight to 10 years," she appealed to the government.

  <img alt="Two special polling stations were set up in Sheung Shui to facilitate Hongkongers returning from the mainland to vote in the 2023 District Council election. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776411_1_20241027114458.jpg&q=65" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang has revealed the government is looking into setting up more polling stations near the border for Hongkongers on the mainland to vote in next year's Legislative Council elections.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measure was first implemented in 2021, when the city's borders were shut due to Covid. In the end 17,569 voters cast their ballots at Heung Yuen Wai, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau checkpoints without having to enter Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For last December's District Council election, officials allowed eligible voters on the mainland to vote at one of the designated polling stations near the border in Sheung Shui, sparing them a trip to their home district. Almost 10,000 people made use of the arrangement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If necessary, we will continue to set up these polling stations, or even enhance and expand [the arrangement], which we are also considering," he told a televised interview on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There might be more choices by then, depending on where the site would be, or whether the location would be suitable as a polling station."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also confirmed the electronic poll register system would remain in use for the upcoming polls.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The system broke down during last year's DC election, causing major delays at certain stations and prompting Electoral Affairs Commission chairman David Lok to issue a teary apology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsang also said there's no need to further amend the current electoral system, saying it's in line with Hong Kong's long-term development.

    FS reiterates need to issue bonds for development

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the government will rely more on long-term capital for infrastructure development in the SAR, including the Northern Metropolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme, Chan revealed that the government's recurrent expenditure has gone up by HK$4 billion per year to facilitate new Policy Address measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities will continue to issue up to HK$130 billion worth of bonds a year to fund various projects. He pointed out that outstanding government bonds make up only 6 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product, a level which is very low compared to other parts of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong faces economic restructuring, and geopolitical uncertainties.... we need to take preventive measures, and at the same time we need to enhance development to make ourselves secure," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan also estimated the government would return to fiscal balance in about three years. One way of achieving that, he said, was to slash expenditure by one percent each year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a separate note, the former development minister said authorities must continue to create land, even as the property market remains volatile.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Recalling the early 2000s when authorities froze their land sale programmes and stopped creating land in response to a market downturn, Chan said the impact of those decisions became evident now.

   "We can better make use of the land in remote places, so prices for properties near the city centre won't be too high, when compared with remote places," he said.

   The financial chief's hectic schedule continues with a visit to Saudi Arabia on Monday, just days after returning from the United States.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Writing on his weekly blog, Chan confirmed he will lead a delegation from the financial and innovation and technology sectors to Riyadh, with an aim to promote Hong Kong and explore business opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They will attend the Future Investment Initiative conference, and witness the launch of two exchange-traded funds tracking SAR stock indices on the Saudi Exchange.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

    G7 meeting takes aim at Russian sanction breaches

  <img alt="In December 2022, the G7, the EU and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil not to breach a price ceiling in a bid to curb Russian petroleum sales and revenues. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776397_1_20241027071814.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed over the war with Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations," the group said in a statement following a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In December 2022, the G7 together with the European Union and Australia agreed to pressure purchasers of Russian oil to not go above a certain price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some countries have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 finance ministers also said they would take additional measures aimed at "increasing the costs to Russia of using the shadow fleet to evade sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials say Russia has used its fleet of shadow tankers, many of them old, unmarked and poorly maintained, to skirt sanctions by transporting oil without properly declaring their cargo or itineraries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tankers sometimes load or transfer their cargo at sea to avoid unwanted attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The United States and the EU have sanctioned several of these ships and their owners, notably Russia's government-owned maritime company Sovcomflot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7 ministers said they intended "to intensify our efforts to prevent financial institutions from supporting Russia's evasion of our sanctions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, Russian financial institutions have developed a network of foreign subsidiaries to facilitate the purchase or sale of sanctioned goods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joining the G7 ministers in the meeting on Saturday were the heads of the seven countries' central banks, plus top officials of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The G7, which groups seven of the world's most advanced economies, announced on Friday it had reached an agreement to provide a loan of around US$50 billion to Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The loan will be repaid not by Ukraine but with the interest -- roughly US$3 billion a year -- generated by Russian assets seized and frozen after the war began in February 2022. (AFP)

    Haaland's boot puts City back on top - for now

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland fired Manchester City to the top of the Premier League as the striker sealed a 1-0 win against Southampton, while third-placed Aston Villa were frustrated by Bournemouth's last-gasp leveller on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had gone three league games without a goal but he ended that mini drought in the first half at the Etihad Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was enough to lift Pep Guardiola's side into first place, two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who can regain pole position if they win Sunday's blockbuster clash with title rivals Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City have not lost a league game at the Etihad for two years, a run encompassing 35 games, and bottom-of-the-table Southampton, who have only one point from nine games this season, were never likely to shatter that impressive streak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku ruled out, Guardiola made four changes to the team that thrashed Sparta Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had scored an audacious goal against Sparta and while his effort to kill off Southampton was more prosaic, it was arguably far more valuable given the context of a tense title race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Matheus Nunes' cross reached Haaland in the fifth minute and the Norwegian showed strength and desire to get to the ball ahead of his marker for a close-range strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City spurned several chances to increase their lead but Haaland's 14th goal in all competitions this season gave the unbeaten champions seven wins from nine league matches as they chase a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The way Southampton played, they are so demanding. Big credit to them, it was not because we were sloppy or flat. I don't have that feeling," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created chances and unfortunately couldn't score the second. I think we were there and sometimes they are good. We have to accept that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aston Villa's hopes of pushing for the title suffered a setback as Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw at Villa Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa are unbeaten in the Champions League, sitting top of the table after seeing off Young Boys, Bayern Munich and Bologna.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But they couldn't follow their latest European success with a domestic victory despite taking the lead in the 76th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ian Maatsen crossed and Leon Bailey teed up Ross Barkley to hook in his first goal for the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Evanilson rescued Bournemouth with a headed equaliser six minutes into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford beat fourth-bottom Ipswich 4-3 in a thrilling clash in west London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ipswich's Sam Szmodics produced a fine finish from 15 yards in the 28th minute before George Hirst clipped a composed strike past Mark Flekken three minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yoane Wissa netted in the 44th minute and Harry Clarke's own goal seconds later hauled Brentford level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bryan Mbeumo's 51st-minute penalty, awarded for Clarke's foul on Keane Lewis-Potter, put Brentford 3-2 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capping a miserable day for Clarke, he was sent off in the closing stages after fouling Lewis-Potter to earn a second booking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liam Delap's 86th-minute equaliser appeared to have spared Clarke's blushes, but Mbeumo snatched victory with the last kick of stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Second-bottom Wolves staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danny Welbeck bagged his sixth goal of the season in first half stoppage-time and Evan Ferguson struck with a clinical finish from Tariq Lamptey's 85th-minute cross to leave Brighton in control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Rayan Ait-Nouri got one back three minutes later and Matheus Cunha saved winless Wolves from a sixth successive league defeat with a deflected equaliser deep into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Everton forward Beto salvaged a 1-1 draw against Fulham as his stoppage-time header cancelled out Alex Iwobi's 61st-minute strike against his former club at Goodison Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although Everton are unbeaten in their last six games, they sit just three places above the relegation zone. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand made history with their first Test series triumph in India as spinner Mitchell Santner's heroic performance delivered a 113-run win in the second match on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand bowled out India for 245 in their chase of 359 on day three in Pune to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marks India's first Test series defeat at home since December 2012, when Alastair Cook's England beat them 2-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner, who's 7-53 in India's first innings of 156 set up the famous win, rattled the Indian chase with six wickets on a turning pitch and trumped the hosts at their own spin game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The left-hander bowled unchanged from one end, returning figures of 6-104 in 29 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ajaz Patel took the final two wickets and ended Ravindra Jadeja's resistance on 42 when the batsmen holed out in the deep and New Zealand celebrated to pin drop silence from the stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Saturday, a visiting New Zealand team had never won a Test series in India dating back to their first trip in 1955.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India bowled out New Zealand for 255 inside the first hour of play and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal in his 65-ball 77 came out attacking to raise hopes of a miracle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India lost skipper Rohit Sharma for eight but raced to 81-1 at lunch in 12 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner took down Shubman Gill for 23 soon after the break to end a 62-run second-wicket stand with the left-handed Jaiswal, who powered on after reaching his fifty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The in-form spinner finally had Jaiswal caught at slip, run out Rishabh Pant for a duck and trapped Virat Kohli lbw, dousing India's chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Glenn Phillips chipped in with the wicket of Washington Sundar for 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India spinners Sundar and Jadeja shared seven wickets between them in the second New Zealand innings, with Jadeja claiming three of the five to fall on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sundar, a lanky off-spinner, returned to the Indian Test team after more than three years and took 7-59.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand made 259 in their first innings riding on knocks from Devon Conway (76) and Rachin Ravindra (65) before Santner took charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have now won four Tests in India after their opening triumph was the first on Indian soil since 1988.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series victory comes after New Zealand's recent 2-0 loss in Sri Lanka on a sub-continent tour, which began with a washed-out Test against Afghanistan near New Delhi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tim Southee stepped down after the Sri Lanka defeat and Tom Latham took over as Test captain. (AFP)

    Death toll from Trami approaches 100 in Philippines

  <img alt="Vast swathes of the Bicol region in the northern Philippines remain under water and many people are still missing or stranded. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776364_1_20241026201337.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rescuers in the Philippines raced on Saturday to reach people still stranded in areas made inaccessible by flooding from Tropical Storm Trami, which has killed at least 97 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami battered the main island of Luzon and forced nearly half a million people to flee their homes as heavy rain caused widespread floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the hardest-hit Bicol region, residents trapped on the roofs and upper floors of their homes were still awaiting desperately needed assistance, officials said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The floods have yet to subside. Calls asking for help are still pouring in," said Bicol regional police director Andre Dizon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We need to rescue them as soon as possible because starvation can be a problem. We're hearing reports that children are already getting sick."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the region's Camarines Sur province, food and drinking water were in increasingly short supply as some areas remained completely submerged and difficult to access, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Ferdinand Marcos visited the province on Saturday to inspect the damage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded," he told government officials during a briefing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have flood control systems but the amount of water is unmanageable. This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too," Marcos added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trami's death toll rose on Saturday as rescuers retrieved more bodies from floodwaters and landslide sites, mostly from the Bicol region and Batangas province, south of Manila.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police have recorded 36 deaths in Bicol, most due to drowning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The number of confirmed dead in Batangas has risen to 54, provincial police chief Jacinto Malinao said, with at least 21 people missing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two were reported dead in separate incidents of electrocution and drowning in Cavite province, police said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five more deaths have been confirmed in other provinces, bringing the total to 97, according to a tally based on official police and disaster agency sources.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Batangas, two hours south of the capital, rescuers were using backhoes and shovels to dig through mud as high as three metres in a desperate search for the missing in areas hit by landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cadaver-sniffing dogs have also been deployed to assist the operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reporters who visited the province on Friday saw roads blocked by felled trees, vehicles half-submerged in mud and homes severely damaged by flash flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are still hoping for the best," said Malinao, the police chief.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will not stop until all bodies are retrieved."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The national disaster agency said on Saturday that about 495,000 people have been displaced by the flooding, which has submerged hundreds of villages in swathes of the northern Philippines. (AFP)
