  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    Britain's King Charles heckled by Australian senator

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Britain's King Charles was accused of "genocide" by an Indigenous senator at Australia's Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his "respects to the traditional owners of the lands".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles' sovereignty over Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You committed genocide against our people," she said. "Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese praised Charles for his long advocacy about the threat of climate change and spoke about the respect Australians had for their monarch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has many outfits and this is one we've saved specifically for today," said Fletcher. "One king meets another king."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hephner's patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth. (Reuters)

    'More effort needed to revive exhibition industry'

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a major trade exhibition company in Hong Kong on Monday said he wants to see more measures to revive the struggling convention and exhibition industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week’s Policy Address outlined plans to spend HK$500 million on launching the Incentive Scheme for Recurrent Exhibitions 2.0, to help the sector stay afloat and promote the mega-event economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Duncan Cheung, director of ComAsia Limited, said geopolitical tensions and manpower shortages are hindering recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In Hong Kong, the exhibition business also suffers from the lack of manpower. For the recovery of the industry, I think it needs more time because you saw so many geopolitical problems,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the government should allocate more money to the international exhibition industry and extend the scheme beyond 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "International exhibitions can bring international exhibitors and also international buyers and visitors to come to Hong Kong. These kinds of visitors or exhibitors have to live in hotels and [benefit] the hotel industry, food and beverage industry and also travel industry."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheung said the exhibition industry has downsized due to the pandemic and has now only resumed to around 70 percent of pre-Covid levels.

    Arabic learning drive a ticket to success: scholar
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A misunderstanding over the government’s apparent ambitions to require taxi drivers learn Arabic has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days, and has even been a target of derision by some in the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the head of the University of Hong Kong’s Arabic programme, Amjad Refai, says this is actually a great idea for Hongkongers – and learning Arabic isn’t as difficult as some may think.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee had said in his latest Policy Address that relevant sectors should provide service information in Arabic to lure in more Middle Eastern tourists, but officials have since clarified that this doesn’t mean cabbies will be expected to learn to converse in Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Monday that they just want more information to be made available in Arabic to help travellers find taxis or Muslim-friendly facilities more easily.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Transport chief Lam Sai-hung also said it would be a good thing if drivers could learn a few simple Arabic phrases such as greetings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai agrees that learning to say hello: أهلاً (ahlaan) or thank you: شكراً (shkraan) isn’t the toughest thing in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I don't believe there is an easy language or there is a difficult language. There is no such thing,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The academic, who has written a textbook for people learning Arabic as a second language, says while learning a language that’s very different from the mother tongue of students makes things challenging, it’s far from insurmountable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We need to make an easy approach for the students,” Refai said. “I don't think Arabic is a difficult language – it's different… new… so students may face challenges and they need to [make] efforts to be familiar with it.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Refai said more and more universities and even private schools here have been offering Arabic courses in recent years, and there was a spike in the number of students learning the language between 2016 and 2019.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, he says since Covid hit, there has been a “shocking” decline in student numbers in Hong Kong in contrast to the mainland, where people seem to be more aware of the advantages of learning a language spoken in countries that are becoming increasingly important trading partners both to the territory and the nation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was expecting that everyone will try to compete to learn Arabic and the numbers are increasing but I don't see this on ground,” Refai lamented.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “In [the] mainland for decades we know the importance of Arabic language and nearly all universities –  even the regional universities – teach Arabic as majors, and a lot of students are studying Arabic on the mainland because they can see the potential of the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the advent of artificial intelligence may have affected peoples’ appetite for learning new languages, as AI makes translation and communications much easier. But he’s still shocked that people here aren’t seizing the career opportunities that would be afforded by learning Arabic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It's still a decent amount of people are learning Arabic, but less than the years I'm talking about – 2016 and 2019 – which has not only surprised me, it shocked me actually, because the Hong Kong and China governments, as part of the initiative of the New Belt and Road, are extending hands towards the Arab world.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He says the best way to learn a new language is via in-person classes, where teachers can best use the human element to communicate face-to-face with their students.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korea on Monday summoned the Russian ambassador to criticise what it claimed as Pyongyang's decision to send thousands of soldiers to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry there said, calling for their immediate withdrawal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 1,500 North Korean special forces soldiers are already in Russia acclimatising and likely to head to the front lines soon, Seoul's spy agency said on Friday, with additional troops set to depart soon, Pyongyang's first such deployment overseas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   South Korea has long claimed the nuclear-armed North is supplying Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, and Seoul expressed alarm over the troop deployment, which comes after Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a military deal in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul expressed its "grave concerns regarding North Korea's recent dispatch of troops to Russia and strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of North Korean forces", vice foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun told Russian ambassador Georgiy Zinoviev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seoul's spy agency released detailed satellite images showing the first batch of 1,500 North Korean special forces from the elite "Storm Corps" had arrived in Vladivostok on Russian military vessels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move "poses a significant security threat not only to South Korea but to the international community", Kim said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For his part, Russian ambassador Zinovyev "stressed that cooperation between Russia and North Korea... is not directed against the interests of South Korea's security", the embassy said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it hopes all parties will work to de-escalate the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “China’s position is consistent and clear,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said during a regular briefing in Beijing, as he urged parties involved to “commit themselves to a political solution".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nato, which has not yet confirmed the North Korean troop deployments, said that it "would mark a significant escalation" in the conflict, chief Mark Rutte said on X. (AFP/Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Foreign Minister Wang Yi has told visiting former French prime minister Laurent Fabius that he hopes China and the European Union (EU) could find ways to resolve trade tensions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has voiced opposition to an EU decision to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and has imposed tariffs on EU brandy imports as part of the trade row.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang said setbacks in bilateral economic and trade relations do not serve the interests of either side in his talks with Fabius, who's now president of the French Constitutional Council, in Beijing on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The foreign minister said the two sides should find ways to address their respective concerns through negotiation and consultation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fabius stressed the need to resolve disputes through dialogue as well. (Agencies)

    'Slashed liquor duty boosts Wine and Spirits Fair'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Trade and Development Council on Monday said the government's decision to reduce the city's spirits duty came just in time for the Wine and Spirits Fair, with more vendors expected to showcase a wider selection of liquor.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six hundred exhibitors from 20 countries and regions will take part in the fair, and it comes on the heels of the government's decision to cut the duty on liquor with an alcohol content of over 30 percent and with an import price of more than HK$200 to 10 percent from 100 percent for the portion above HK$200.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a media preview for the event, the council's Deputy Executive Director, Sophia Chong, said more than 20 percent of vendors would be bringing hard liquor to the fair, which takes place from November 7 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Like this time, we have whiskey from Ireland as well. All these liquor, brandy, tequila, and all these spirits and liquor can also be traded via Hong Kong to the rest of Asia, including mainland China," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vendor Andrew Wong said more people will have the chance to taste high-end spirits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People may be drinking medium or low-level [spirits], and they now can have more room to drink good quality [spirits] with a reasonable price," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But fellow vendor Simon Disler said the duty reduction was not big enough to give him the wiggle room to offer more discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For five or ten percent of my items, I would be able to offer discounts to my customers. But for the other 90 percent, there won't be a discount," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fair will be held at the Convention and Exhibition Centre where wines and spirits, including baijiu, sake and vodka will be showcased.

    Civil servants to get three days of childcare leave

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government says it plans to offer three days of childcare leave a year to civil servants with children under three, a move expected to benefit some 12,000 employees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The administration on Monday said the family-friendly policy is expected to start in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a Legco public service panel meeting, several unionist lawmakers asked why officials have decided on three days and then only for parents of children under three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They asked whether more days off could be offered and whether the leave could be extended to parents of older children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung said Singapore offers six days of childcare leave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung said officials are already striking a balance between several factors, adding that the scheme will be reviewed after implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We roll out government-friendly measures for government workers, but then there's also a need for manpower, and operational needs for departments. We have to be prudent with this new measure," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At that preschool age below three, children usually stay at home. They need more care at home. That's why we set the threshold at three years old."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan and former minister Lai Tung-kwok of the New People's Party asked whether civil servants could be given a day off for their birthday, with Lai saying this would provide a morale boost to those who don't have children.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung said officials will consider the suggestion, but providing leave does come with a financial burden for the government.

    'Function over price when eateries buy cutlery'

  <img alt="Alvis Yip says the prices of his company's non-plastic cutlery have dropped by 10 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775450_2_20241021142141.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A company that supplies wooden and bamboo forks, knives and spoons to restaurants on Monday said price has become a far less significant factor for eateries when making purchases of cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Maybe I can use the knife as an example. At the beginning people are just concerned about the price. They choose a wooden knife and fork but because of the functionality of the wood it cannot cut like a harder steak. So people now choose the bamboo fork and knife which can be used to cut the steak easily,” Alvis Yip, founder of Supply Ching Company said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said his products were initially about 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than the plastic ones, but his prices have now dropped by about 10 percent, benefiting from economies of scale.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip was one of four suppliers invited by the Environmental Protection Department to showcase their products to the press six months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the event, another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak, but the fork snapped during two attempts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked whether the issue affected his sales in any way, Yip said it actually gave customers more confidence in his products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “At the beginning we were concerned about that incident, that will it affect the reputation of sustainable food packaging. But after that event it kind of benefits us because while the citizens are often laughing at the presentation, the restaurants are actually more concerned about the functionality. That event created chances or situations for us to explain more of our products' details to our customers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip said he also noticed a significant drop in reliance on one-off cutlery as people adapt to more sustainable options, but stressed he is not worried about his sales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s like that restaurants are preparing for, for example, 10,000 sets of cutlery because they are using the assumption from plastic cutlery, but then they end up just using 5,000 for a month. So monthly usage can drop by 50 percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But I can draw more customers using our quality and new designs and new materials by increasing our functionalities… We will just have some good quality supplies left in the market in the end.”

    'Monkey enclosure can reopen when situation improves'

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday said the authorities will consider reopening the mammals section of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens when a health scare involving monkeys there comes to an end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A De Brazza’s monkey, three common squirrel monkeys, four white-faced sakis and three cotton-top tamarins have died in the past week or so, with tests on some of them revealing they had melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria in soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said workers had dug up the ground near the monkey enclosure earlier this month and may have brought in contaminated soil on their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a radio programme, Yeung said one monkey is still undergoing quarantine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When the situation is back to normal, we'll consider reopening the area. We've observed their behaviour and sometimes it was a little unusual compared to normal," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The condition of the monkey in quarantine fluctuates. Sometimes it is bad and sometimes it is good. It's receiving medical treatment."

    Single-use plastics ban running smoothly: EPD

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Environmental Protection Department says the first phase of the city's single-use plastics ban has been implemented smoothly and orderly, with a six-month adaptation period concluding on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview with RTHK, deputy director of the department Kenneth Cheng said 80 percent of customers of chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have chosen not to offer any takeaway utensils.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department estimates that 30 million fewer sets of disposable cutlery than usual have been given out by the catering sector since the ban took effect in April, Cheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He praised the hotel sector for being “ahead of the international trend” by reducing its use of plastics by 80 percent over the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheng said shopping malls and office buildings have stopped giving out disposable umbrella bags and few people have been using glow sticks or party hats during festive events, showing that a culture of reducing plastic is gradually developing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules now face fines of up to HK$100,000, but Cheng said the department will prioritise education over punishment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can see that the culture of reducing plastic is progressing. We don't believe that heavily penalising businesses is the right way to implement this culture. Instead, we think it should be achieved through promotion and education. But of course we will enforce the law after the adaptation period, but the focus will be on primary suppliers,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We inspected the selling points in the past and identified those that have not yet met the requirements. We will inspect them again and will issue a written warning to them if they haven’t improved. We will give them 10 more days to make the necessary changes.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked when the second phase of the ban, which will cover items including takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups, will be introduced, Cheng said there is currently no specific timetable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the move will depend on factors such as social acceptance, available replacements and international trends.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tommy Edman and Will Smith homered to send Shohei Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Los Angeles Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers took the best-of-seven National League Championship Series 4-2 over the Mets and will open the World Series at home on Friday against the New York Yankees, who own a record 27 titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This will be the Dodgers' 22nd World Series –13th in Los Angeles – and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. Game 1 is Friday at Dodger Stadium, pitting New York slugger Aaron Judge and Ohtani – MLB's top home-run hitters this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,” Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. “It’s going to be a battle of two good teams – a lot of long flights across the country.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’ll be the 12th time the storied franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,” Ohtani said through a translator, “and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record-breaking contract in free agency, had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Not bad for his first postseason after spending six years with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers eliminated the Mets on their second try in the series. They outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. None of the games were close, with the Dodgers earning two shutouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, meanwhile, came within two wins of reaching the World Series after a 22-33 start. (AFP/AP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Monday said officials will study how to make better use of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In last week's Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR will publish an action plan on developing cruise tourism to enhance the terminal's role as a hub for conventions and exhibitions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We now hope to see if we can better utilise the space of the cruise terminal. For example, can we make use of the rooftop area? It's currently a park. Is there anything else we can do there? How can we promote more convention and exhibition activities?" Yeung told a radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about Singapore receiving more cruise ships than Hong Kong in July and August, the minister said it's not a fair comparison.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Traditionally, Hong Kong's typhoon season runs from May to August. This doesn't exist in some places, for example Singapore. So, comparing cruise ship numbers in July and August is not the best," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's not about how many typhoons we have in July and August, but because cruise lines won't take risks in their scheduling during the typhoon season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung also said more will be done to develop "horse racing tourism" as outlined in the policy blueprint, such as working with the Jockey Club to promote international horse-racing events.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said authorities need to carefully consider whether the current 18-year-old age limit for racegoers would be lowered.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey bagged two golds and a bronze to conclude the first stop of the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Olympic medallist won her first medal of the competition on Saturday in the women's 200 metres freestyle, with a time of 1 minute 51.46 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey, who won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics, brought more good news on the final day in Shanghai by winning a bronze in the 50 metres breaststroke, followed by a gold in the 100 metres freestyle only 15 minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She came third in the breaststroke event after finishing with a time of 29.74 seconds – behind China's Tang Qianting and Benedetta Pilato of Italy – to create a new Hong Kong record, and dominated the freestyle event by leading from start to finish, ending with a time of 51.89 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second leg of the World Cup will be held in Incheon, South Korea from October 24-26, while the last stop will be in Singapore from October 31 to November 2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The World Cup is a qualifying event for the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest at the end of the year.

   Jonquel Jones scored 17 points to lead New York, which was one of the original franchises in the league. The Liberty made the WNBA Finals five times before, losing each one, including last season. This time they wouldn’t be denied, although it took an extra five minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gave the city of New York its first basketball title since 1973 when the Knicks won the NBA championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu struggling on offense, other players stepped up. Leonie Fiebich started off overtime with a 3-pointer, and then Nyara Sabally had a steal for a layup to make it 65-60 and bring the sellout crowd to a frenzied state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota didn’t score in overtime until Kayla McBride hit two free throws with just under two minutes left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx missed all six of their field goal attempts in overtime. After Ionescu missed a shot with 21 seconds left, her 18th miss on 19 shot attempts, the Lynx had one last chance, but Bridget Carleton missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stewart, who missed a free throw with 0.8 seconds left in Game 1, hit two free throws with 10.1 seconds left to seal the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the players hugged and streamers fell from the rafters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Napheesa Collier scored 22 points to lead Minnesota before fouling out with 13 seconds left in overtime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx were trying for a record fifth WNBA title, breaking a tie with the Seattle Storm and Houston Comets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota won four titles from 2011 to 2017 behind the core group of Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Sylvia Fowles and Maya Moore. That was the team’s last appearance in the WNBA Finals until this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is the first time since 2019 that the WNBA Finals have gone the distance. Since the league switched to a best-of-five format in 2005, seven other series have gone to a Game 5 and the home team has won five of those contests, including in 2019. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An outstanding all-round performance by Amelia Kerr led New Zealand to their first ever Women's T20 World Cup title as they beat South Africa by a commanding 32 runs in Sunday's final in Dubai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Player of the Match Kerr top-scored with 43 as New Zealand posted an imposing 158-5 in their 20 overs before taking 3-24, and crucially picking up the key wickets of Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch, to restrict South Africa to 126-9 in their 20 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marked a sweet finish to skipper Sophie Devine's career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The victory came 14 years after the White Ferns lost to Australia by just three runs in the 2010 final. They also lost to England in the 2009 championship match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For South Africa it made for a double disappointment having lost last year's final to Australia in Cape Town. (AFP)

    Cuba's power grid collapses again as storm hits

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba's electrical grid collapsed again on Sunday, the fourth such failure in 48 hours, with a hurricane making landfall to compound the island's misery and threaten further havoc on its infrastructure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba earlier on Sunday had said it was making headway restoring service after multiple false starts, though millions of people remained without electricity more than two days after the grid's initial collapse.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Restoration work began immediately," the country's energy and mines ministry said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hurricane Oscar made landfall on the Caribbean island on Sunday, bringing strong winds, a powerful storm surge and rain to parts of eastern Cuba and threatening to further complicate the government's efforts to reestablish service.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's meteorological survey warned of "an extremely dangerous situation" in eastern Cuba, while the US National Hurricane Center reported winds of 120 kilometres per hour as the storm made its way across the island.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the forecast track, the center of Oscar is expected to continue moving across eastern Cuba tonight and Monday, then emerge off the northern coast of Cuba late Monday and cross the central Bahamas on Tuesday," the Hurricane Center said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government canceled school through Wednesday – a near unprecedented move in Cuba – citing the hurricane and the ongoing energy crisis. Officials said only essential workers should report to work on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The repeated grid collapses marked a major setback in the government's efforts to quickly restore power to exhausted residents already suffering from severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The multiple setbacks in the first 48 hours also underscored the complexity of the work and the still precarious state of the country's grid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba had restored power to 160,000 clients in Havana just prior to the grid's Sunday collapse, giving some residents a glimmer of hope.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But housewife Anabel Gonzalez, of old Havana, a neighborhood popular with tourists, said she was growing desperate after three days without power.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My cell phone is dead and look at my refrigerator. The little that I had has all gone to waste," she said, pointing to bare shelves in her two-room home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Energy and mines minister Vicente de la O Levy told reporters earlier on Sunday he expected the grid to be fully functional by Monday or Tuesday but warned residents not to expect dramatic improvements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was not immediately clear how much the latest setback would delay the government's efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba's national electrical grid first crashed around midday on Friday after the island's largest power plant shut down, sowing chaos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The grid collapsed again on Saturday morning, state-run media reported
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By early evening on Saturday, authorities reported some progress restoring power before announcing another partial grid collapse. (Reuters)

  <img alt="China's central bank has cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.10 percent from 3.35 percent, and the five-year LPR has been cut to 3.6 percent from 3.85 percent.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race," said Leclerc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer," Verstappen, meanwhile, said after the race. "It was a tough battle and tough to keep Norris behind, but it's a great result."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City snatched a controversial 2-1 win at Wolves as John Stones' last-gasp goal was given after a VAR review to send the champions to the top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pep Guardiola's side trailed to Jorgen Strand Larsen's surprise opener for Wolves early in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol dragged City back on level terms before the interval and, with just seconds left in stoppage time, Stones headed the visitors to a dramatic sixth win in eight league games this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bottom-of-the-table Wolves claimed Stones' goal should have been disallowed for offside and interference by Bernardo Silva on goalkeeper Jose Sa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm trying to remain calm," Wolves boss Gary O'Neil said. "I have been involved in a few of those and not had many go in our favour."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is some grey area that can go either way and once it was like that I wasn't confident it would go our way," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are a point clear of previous leaders Liverpool, who reclaimed pole position with a victory against Chelsea on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chasing a fifth successive English title, Guardiola's men have set a new club record as their unbeaten run in the league reached 31 games since their loss to Aston Villa in December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In English top-flight history, only six times has a side gone more than 30 matches without losing, most recently Liverpool's run of 44 games from 2019 to 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are not used to winning games at the end, like Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool it many times happened. It is a good flavour for us," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 or 12 games in the Premier League you don't have to see the table, it is just the beginning," Guardioloa added. "But of course it is nice to be winning, you are alive and in that position." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the world's two highest ranked players, brings out the best in both, Sinner said on Saturday after beating Alcaraz in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner, who won 6-7(5) 6-3 6-3 to bag the US$6 million title, said he hoped for a long rivalry with Alcaraz, after Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced off for the final time in the third-place match earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wake up in the morning trying to understand the ways how to beat him. This kind of rivalries, this kind of players, they push us always to our 100 percent," world number one Sinner said in a post-match interview.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hopefully this rivalry will last as long as possible. But there are so many other great players who can jump in – let's see what's coming in the future," the 23-year-old said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy's Sinner and Spain's Alcaraz have won two Grand Slams each this year, with Alcaraz beating Sinner in closely fought clashes at the French Open semi-finals and the China Open final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The off-the-court friends have played each other 10 times on the ATP tour, with 21-year-old Alcaraz winning six matches, including the last three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will do everything so that this rivalry gets better and better – I am happy to share the court with him," four-times Grand Slam winner Alcaraz said. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of a green group believes Hong Kong is prepared to extend its ban on single-use plastics, as the six-month adaptation period under the first phase of the ban ends on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules face fines of up to HK$100,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the rules, restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said eateries and hotels are generally adapting well to the new regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Through my observation, I gathered that most of the restaurants... I think most of them have done a good job to follow the single-use plastics ban, and they quickly can find the alternative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am aware that for the hotel industry they are still trying to find an alternative for shower caps. But apart from this item, the rest of the items, I heard them saying that hotels are quite alright in getting all those other alternatives or advising customers to use their own private sets,” he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second phase, set to begin in 2025, will extend the ban to include plastic cups, food containers for takeouts, as well as plastic dental floss and tablecloths.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau sees no difficulties for businesses to adjust to the regulations, adding that phase 2 should be rolled out as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I'm sure with the first phase, they have adapted to the changes quite well. And I believe they are well-prepared for the introduction of the second phase of the single-use plastics ban. You can see there are many non-plastic alternatives for takeaway lunch box, congee bowl, and this is no big problem for them,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lau also noted that currently, many alternatives for plastic products are still of the single-use type, and officials should enhance promotion and encourage people to bring their own lunch boxes and cutlery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Environmental Protection Department estimated that the catering sector has cut down on the use of 30 million sets of disposable cutlery since April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the department also noted that 80 percent of customers at chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have decided to stop providing disposable cutlery for takeaways.

    Liverpool beat Chelsea, claim top Premier League spot

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arne Slot said Liverpool rose to the challenge posed by a step up in opposition after beating Chelsea 2-1 to move back top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Reds had not faced any of the top nine in the table in their opening seven league games of the season to give Slot a gentle start to the demanding task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool did not have things all their own way at Anfield, but ground out another victory thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' second-half winner after Nicolas Jackson brought Chelsea level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The better the teams you face the more you need to fight," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It helps if you play against a Chelsea, it is a big game and everyone feels it," he added. "We felt it and the fans felt it because they were there for us today. We showed up, that was the most important thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit of a confident Chelsea side kicked off a daunting run for Slot's men in the coming months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool face Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Manchester City in four of their next five Premier League games, as well as Champions League ties against RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid before the end of November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is our biggest test, to play Champions League and Premier League, the hardest games, three days in a row," added Slot. "Many other games were hard but this might have been the hardest maybe because of the amount of quality players they have and the structure they have."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defeat for Chelsea was their first in the league since Enzo Maresca's debut as coach against Manchester City on the opening weekend of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there were plenty of positives for Maresca as the Blues were a different animal to the side that were thrashed 4-1 on their last visit to Anfield in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't like to drop points and lose a game, but if you have to choose a way, this is the way," said Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We came here and tried to control the game. For most of the game we played in their half and I thought the performance was fantastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I came here many times in the past and I know how difficult it is but the way we controlled and managed the game was fantastic," he added. "This is the right direction." (AFP)

    Pope creates 14 new saints at Vatican ceremony

  <img alt="Pope Francis presides over the Holy Mass and canonization of 14 saints and martyrs. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775385_1_20241020230107.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pope Francis created a new group of saints on Sunday, canonising 14 individuals including the "martyrs of Damascus", killed in Syria during the Ottoman Empire and symbols of Christian persecution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francis presided over the canonisation ceremony in Saint Peter's Square in the presence of thousands of Catholic faithful from around the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We enrol them among the saints, decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole Church," proclaimed Francis, after reciting each name.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canonisation is the final step towards sainthood in the Catholic Church, following beatification.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three conditions are required -- most crucially that the individual has performed at least two miracles. He or she must be deceased for at least five years and have led an exemplary Christian life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the group are 11 individuals known as the "martyrs of Damascus", who have become saints some 160 years after their death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The eight Franciscan friars and three lay Maronites -- all siblings -- from a monastery were assassinated by Druze militants in July 1860 in the Syrian capital, then under Ottoman rule.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They were beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1926.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Damascus is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world but its Christian population has dwindled to only about two percent today, according to the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many citizens, Christian and otherwise, have left the city since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The martyrdom of the Damascus group canonised on Sunday "is not very different from the situation of many Christians in the Middle East today", wrote Vatican News, the official news portal of the Vatican.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The other three individuals, who died early in the 20th century, founded religious communities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They are Italian missionary Giuseppe Allamano, Italian nun Elena Guerra and the Canadian Marie-Leonie Paradis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In May, Pope Francis announced he would canonise Italian teenager Carlos Acutis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-born adolescent spent his life spreading his faith online, earning the moniker "God's Influencer", before dying from leukaemia in 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The date of that canonisation has not yet been set but it could take place in 2025, the Church's Jubilee year, when more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to descend on Rome. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The government on Sunday said the second isolated common squirrel monkey from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens had died, taking the monkey death toll to 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The death of the common squirrel monkey followed earlier news of a tenth death, also of a common squirrel monkey. Both had been in isolation following a spate of monkey deaths at the gardens that began about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said nine monkeys had died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat. Autopsies found a large amount of a bacteria that causes the disease in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will conduct necropsy to see whether the cause of death was the same as the other cases earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One monkey, a De Brazza Monkey, remains in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

    Ethnic minorities get boost in job search

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   While ethnic minority job seekers said language barriers remain their biggest obstacle, some companies have improved their prospects by adding more English to training materials and lowering their Chinese language requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Various government departments and firms were recruiting staff at a job fair held on Sunday by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). One of them was a franchised bus company offering positions such as bus captains, technicians and customer service officers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citybus said all Chinese guidelines have been translated into English to accommodate ethnic minority workers. It also said the requirement for bus captains now is basic communication in Cantonese, compared with reading and writing Chinese and speaking fluent Cantonese in the past.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm has about 30 ethnic minority staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they are quite embedded in our whole population, our local bus captains are happy to work with them. All the people in the company, they know that the company is an inclusive employer," said Citybus general manager Roger Wong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rojal, who's from Nepal and has been in Hong Kong for almost a decade, submitted an application with a bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said he found it hard to land a job here because of language barriers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The employers are really looking for someone who actually can speak the language," he said. "I'm not exactly sure why that's the case, perhaps the clients want you to speak in Chinese or the documents could be in Chinese."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another job seeker, Bharvani, echoed the sentiment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Even though I studied here, my Chinese reading and writing skills are not that great. So it (throws out) at least half or three-fourths of the job opportunities," said the ethnic Indian who was born and raised in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The head of the EOC, Linda Lam, said more should be done to create job opportunities for ethnic minorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In fact, there are many young ethnic minorities with qualifications, outstanding attitude, and are [highly-skilled], and they are suitable to work in various levels of an organisation," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the future, we will be organising other activities to continue our efforts, to promote the breaking down of stereotypes, to help the ethnic minorities to have more opportunities to participate in different levels in the workforce."

  <img alt="Officials say landlords of illegal subdivided flats could face prosecution by the end of 2026 at the earliest. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=25&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775368_1_20241020164030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government could start prosecuting landlords of illegal subdivided flats by the end of 2026 at the earliest, with the possibility of jail terms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee announced plans to regulate subdivided units, renaming the vetted flats "basic housing units" (BHUs) and making those smaller than 86 square feet illegal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ho said if all goes smoothly, laws would be passed by the end of next year, and that would be followed by a period for landlords to register and a grace period for them to renovate the flats to meet the new requirements.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[If] a one-year registration period is enough, that would take us to the end of 2026," she said on a Commercial Radio programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If landlords don't register during the period and continue to operate homes that violate our regulations, then law enforcement could begin at the end of 2026, or at the start of 2027 at the earliest. That's within the term of the current administration."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who heads a government task force on the matter, said the timeline is not set in stone, citing an upcoming public consultation exercise and discussion with lawmakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong also said he doesn't think there'll be a significant drop in supply, pointing to the availability of more BHUs in the market in future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that among tenants of current subdivided flats, 60 percent of them are eligible to apply for public housing and the rest could look for BHUs or transitional housing units, insisting everyone will have a roof over their heads.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a TVB programme, Lee said landlords of subdivided flats are allowed to raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent under existing rent-control laws. The CE also said tenants can move from one BHU to another in future, in the event rents go up.

    'Fair to revise allocation ratio for subsidised flats'

  <img alt="John Lee says public housing tenants should be given a chance to climb the housing ladder. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775355_1_20241020125545.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee said giving public housing tenants a greater chance to buy Home Ownership Scheme units is a step towards helping them climb the housing ladder and should not be deemed unfair to the broader public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During a TVB programme aired on Sunday, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to "pressure" the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation favours well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out in accordance with government policy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of speculative activity under present market conditions are very low.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto on Sunday took over as president of the world's third-largest democracy after sweeping the country's election with policies like free meals for schoolchildren and with the outgoing leader's son as his running mate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 73-year-old former special forces commander won the February 14 contest with nearly 60 percent of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prabowo, wearing a traditional black hat and navy suit with a woven maroon and golden sarong, officially became Indonesia's eighth president on Sunday morning after he was sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesia's parliament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping congratulated him on taking office.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his message to Prabowo, Xi said China and Indonesia have traditionally been friendly neighbours, and the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year will create opportunities for further bilateral cooperation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vice President Han Zheng, as Xi's special representative, attended the inauguration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new Indonesian leader, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, said in a speech to lawmakers after taking his oath of office that he would be president for all Indonesians, even those who did not vote for him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he said there were internal issues in the country that had to be grappled with, including corruption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Do we realise that our people and our children are malnourished? So many of our people don't have good jobs. So many of our schools are neglected," Prabowo said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be courageous looking at all of this, and we have to be courageous solving all these problems."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was joined in the swearing-in ceremony by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flower boards set up outside the presidential palace congratulated Prabowo and Gibran, and thanked Jokowi for his decade as president.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi supporters also attended celebrations to bid farewell to Indonesia's outgoing leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anneta Yuniar, a bystander who had excitedly waved at Jokowi's motorcade as it slowly made its way past supporters before the ceremony, said she would miss Jokowi but that Prabowo was a strong leader.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Prabowo will continue the development that Jokowi started. There's continuity. It's what I want," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Critics also say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

    Soto home run puts Yankees in World Series

  <img alt="Juan Soto's three-run blast helps the Yankees finish off the Guardians in the American League Championship Series. Photo: Scott Galvin-Imagn Images via Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=40&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775353_1_20241020124301.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Baseball’s biggest brand is going back to October’s main stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Juan Soto hit a three-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning and the New York Yankees advanced to their 41st World Series – and first in 15 years – by beating the Cleveland Guardians 5-2 in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) on Saturday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto, who was acquired in a seven-player trade with San Diego in December, moved the Bronx Bombers into position with one big swing. He also caught the final out of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’re right where we belong,” said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who pulled off the deal for Soto.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to win their 28th title against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers. Game 6 of the National League Championship Series is on Sunday at Dodger Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 10th, Austin Wells walked with one out and Alex Verdugo followed with a grounder to second baseman Andrés Giménez, whose soft toss to the bag was dropped by rookie shortstop Brayan Rocchio for an error.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland reliever Hunter Gaddis struck out Gleyber Torres and had Soto in a 1-2 count before New York’s stylish outfielder sent a shot over the wall in centre. Soto danced down the first-base line and paused to celebrate with his teammates before circling the bases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was just saying to myself, `You’re all over that guy. You’re all over that guy. He ain’t got anything,’” said Soto, who moved alongside his manager, Aaron Boone, as the only New York players to homer in an extra-inning, series-clinching win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto is eligible for free agency this winter, and Yankees fans chanted “Re-sign Soto!” during the post-game festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer and was named ALCS MVP as the Yankees took care of the Guardians in five games. It wasn’t easy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York won the first two at Yankee Stadium without much fanfare or any major drama. However, it was a different story in Cleveland as all three games at Progressive Field were nail-biters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians rallied to win Game 3 on two, two-run homers in their last two at-bats, and the Yankees held on to win Game 4 after blowing a four-run lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This was a roller coaster and we were able to just keep punching back,” Stanton said. “We know there’s much more work to do and it’s only uphill from here and we got to get it done.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland just didn’t have enough and a surprising season under first-year manager Stephen Vogt ended just short of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The franchise remains without a title since 1948, baseball’s current longest drought. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said a new government body aimed at developing tourist hotspots will hold its first meeting next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible," Yeung said.

    Adequate measures taken over monkey deaths: Govt

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the government has taken sufficient preventive measures at the Zoological and Botanical Gardens on news of the death of a tenth monkey there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7pm on Friday, local media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were no casualties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Myanmar military blamed "terrorists" for the explosion that damaged roof tiles on the two-storey consulate, adding that security forces were investigating in order to arrest anyone found responsible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, a resident living near the consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township said security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Mexican navy announced on Saturday it had seized more than 8.3 tonnes of drugs in the Pacific Ocean, a record for a single operation at sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Navy personnel seized 8,361 kilogrammes of illicit cargo, which represents the largest amount of drugs seized in a maritime operation, unprecedented in history," said a statement from the Ministry of the Navy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It did not specify the type of the drugs, but said they were valued at 2.099 billion pesos (US$105 million).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-three people were arrested during the bust which took place southwest of the port of Lazaro Cardenas, off the western coast of Mexico.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drugs were distributed in six small boats and one of the vessels was a submersible, which implied a "complex" action on the part of the sailors, added the ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The largest drug seizure in Mexico's history was 23 tonnes of Colombian cocaine in November 2007.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mexico has for decades been the hub of drug trafficking to the United States, with a large number of cartels fighting for control of the trade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The state of Michoacan, off the coast of which the seizure took place, is the scene of clashes between criminal gangs, including the powerful Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent criminal groups. (AFP)

   The regional assembly of Portugal's Azores Islands approved the creation of the largest protected marine area in the North Atlantic to reach international conservation goals well ahead of time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval places the archipelago at the forefront of global ocean conservation that aims to achieve the goals set by the United Nations of protecting 30 percent of the Earth's land and sea by 2030 under a global pact adopted last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network will encompass almost 300,000 square kilometres and ensure the preservation of underwater mountain ranges and vulnerable marine ecosystems, including deep-sea corals, hydrothermal vents and marine species.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have acted in advance of the international conservation goals for 2030 with the creation of the largest marine park in the North Atlantic, with fully protected areas and highly protected areas," Bernardo Brito e Abreu, adviser to the Azorean government on maritime affairs said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He explained that half of the network would be designated as a fully protected area, which means fishing activities are not allowed. In the other half, designated as a highly protected area, only very selective fishing will be allowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nine-island archipelago is an autonomous region roughly 1,500 km west of mainland Portugal and home to unique marine biodiversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Azores government chief Jose Manuel Bolieiro said the region was leading by example at national, European and international levels in the management and protection of its waters and "making a significant contribution to Portugal meeting the international targets for the decade". (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory over Ineos Britannia on Saturday to defend the America's Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating their British opponents by 37 seconds in the ninth race off Barcelona to end the best-of-13 series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand raced into a 4-0 lead in the 37th edition of the competition before Britain fought back with two victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However the Kiwis responded with three points in a row to clinch a third straight victory after their successes in 2017 and 2021, the country's fifth triumph in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What an amazing feeling, it's been a tough battle all week, but an amazing scoreline and I'm proud of the way the team kept battling today," said Kiwi helmsman Peter Burling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's still just sinking in... what an awesome day, Barcelona's just been absolutely amazing, what an amazing feeling."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ninth race was delayed by 40 minutes because of light wind conditions but eventually began with Ineos knowing they needed to win five straight races to lift the trophy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British boat crossed the start line a knot faster than their opponents and the teams exchanged the lead until New Zealand pulled ahead by 200 metres at the first gate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kiwis extended their lead to 22 seconds by the second mark but Ineos continued to fight relentlessly and cut the gap to 69 metres at one point in the fourth leg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The right side of the course offered higher pressure and New Zealand did a good job of defending it, denying Britain a way back in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Skipper Ben Ainslie and Ineos, bankrolled by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, needed a miracle like the comeback from 8-1 down to win Oracle Team USA the America's Cup in 2013, but it was not forthcoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Britain have still never won the competition which started 173 years ago with a race around the Isle of Wight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team, and in my view they are the best team ever in the America's Cup," said Ainslie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day the better team won.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is not going to be the end of the journey for us, we set out 10 years ago to win the America's Cup, we're getting closer each time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The trick is to keep going and get it home the next time." (AFP)

    Low-altitude trials to include Cyberport, Science Park

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The first phase of pilot projects on developing the low-altitude economy will focus on using drones for food delivery and transporting cargo with Cyberport and Science Park being in the pipeline, the government said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching "regulatory sandboxes" early next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the government's plan to reduce waste in Hong Kong remains unchanged despite the shelving of the waste charging scheme, adding that raising public awareness and increasing recycling facilities instead has achieved great results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government announced earlier this year that they would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme in August as originally planned, but the environment chief said at a press conference on Saturday that good recycling and waste management practice has increased immensely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tse said that they will optimise a plan and share their progress with the Legislative Council in the middle of next year.

    97% of HK's riverbank waste is plastic: Greenpeace

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Greenpeace on Saturday said more than 3,200 pieces of rubbish have been collected in its clean-up operations along two of Hong Kong's riverbanks in the past four months, with 97 percent of it being plastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top items found in the Lam Tsuen and Pui O Rivers were food and beverage packaging, disposable plastic tableware, and shipping materials, the environmental group told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam said microplastics from these sources can enter ecosystems and food chains, potentially affecting human health.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It easily get into the ecosystem because they are small, maybe eaten by animals. Or even when we drink it or we eat through the food chain, they will enter our blood system or even our brain," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tam said the government should implement a HK$1 deposit system for beverage bottles, rather than the proposed 10-cent incentive, to better tackle plastic waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The government should add the reduction target on single-use packaging and also the reuse target for the overall package and overall beverage packaging system," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The advocate added that individuals and companies can also play a part by choosing packaging-free items and changing their business models to phase out single-use plastics.

    Record high Colombian cocaine production in 2023: UN

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine exporter, set a new record last year for production of the drug and cultivation of the coca leaf it is made from, a United Nations report said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf cultivation was 10 percent higher last year than in 2022, while cocaine production rose 53 percent from 1,738 tonnes to 2,600, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were the highest numbers since the UN started monitoring in 2001. Most Colombian cocaine is destined for the United States and Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Coca leaf production now spreads over 253,000 hectares (625,100 acres) in the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trend has been upward since 2014 despite a US-based war on drugs worth millions of US dollars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The areas of Colombia with the biggest increase in 2023 were the Cauca and Narino departments, both bastions of dissidents groups of the FARC guerrilla army that disbanded in 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 percent of the total area under coca cultivation in Colombia is on land belonging to communities of African descent, 10 percent on Indigenous reserves and 18 percent in protected forest areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Colombian city of Cali will host the COP16 global summit on biodiversity for two weeks starting on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Colombia's first-ever leftist President Gustavo Petro has accused US anti-drug policies of causing a "genocide" of Latin Americans for focusing on "repression" rather than prevention and public health. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Gaza's civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on Friday night near Jabalia in the territory's north killed 33 people at a refugee camp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal announced "33 deaths and dozens of wounded" while a medical source at the Al-Awda hospital said earlier that it had registered 22 dead and 70 wounded after the strike on the Tal al-Zaatar camp for Palestinian refugees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked for comment about overnight strikes in the area, an Israeli army spokesperson said they were "looking into it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On October 6, Israel launched a new offensive in northern Gaza, including around Jabalia, saying it was targeting Hamas fighters who were regrouping there.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, scores of people have been killed in the area, which had already been hit hard by fighting earlier in the year-long war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The UN humanitarian affairs agency said on Friday night that it continued "to sound the alarm about the increasingly dire and dangerous situation that civilians in northern Gaza are facing. Families there are trying to survive in atrocious conditions, under heavy bombardment." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Buses ranging from museum pieces to state-of-the-art machines on Saturday rolled through the city to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The parade, organised by the Transport Department and three franchised bus operators, featured retired and in-service buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The procession started in Victoria Park, passing along the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and finishing up at the Central Ferry Piers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is also a four-day bus exhibition underway at Victoria Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at the departure ceremony, transport minister Lam Sai-hung said buses have long been an indispensable part of people's livelihoods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rapid development of new energy technologies of our country in recent years has enriched Hong Kong's choices of new energy public transport," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous electric double-decker buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses introduced into Hong Kong in the past few years were China-made models."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many bus lovers gathered to take photos of the parading buses, including Mr Lee, who purposely came from Guangzhou, to see some of the SAR's antique buses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have never seen these discontinued buses in a public event parading before, so I think this opportunity is very rare. I purposely came from the mainland to see them," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another spectator, Mr Chan, was ecstatic to see history passing through the streets of Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I didn't think they would host a bus tour. I saw some new buses. It turns out that one of them is a new Citybus that is probably not in service yet. I couldn't believe that new buses would be featured in the parade. It’s really exciting. I hope the government will organise more parades in the future."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Mets kept their magical season going, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-6 on Friday to stay alive in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pete Alonso hit a three-run home run in the first inning and the Mets piled up five runs in the third on the way to an 8-1 lead, then held on to cut the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers, who were hoping to close out the series at the Mets' Citi Field, instead will host game six on Sunday, again with a chance to return to the World Series for the first time since they won it all in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We'll be ready," Alonso vowed. "We love opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Andy Pages homered twice for the Dodgers, including a three-run blast that cut New York's lead to 10-5 in the fifth inning. Mookie Betts's solo homer in the sixth pulled the Dodgers within four, but the Mets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte belted three doubles, driving in three runs on four hits for New York. Francisco Lindor and Jesse Winker both plated runs with triples for the Mets, who had 14 hits with no strikeouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will take on either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, with a three-run homer from Giancarlo Stanton and a tie-breaking pair of runs in the top of the ninth, beat the Guardians 8-6 to take a 3-1 stranglehold on the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, with their backs against the wall, came out firing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They seized a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Alonso's towering home run to center field that also scored Lindor and Brandon Nimmo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pulled a run back with two out in the second when Enrique Hernandez raced home on a wild pitch from Mets hurler David Peterson to Shohei Ohtani.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Mets poured it on in the third when Marte made Dodgers starting pitcher Jack Flaherty pay for walking Alonso and Winker to open the frame, belting a double up the left field line that scored both.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty retired two batters before the Mets put together three straight run-scoring hits to make it 8-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Peterson surrendered a solo home run to Pages in the fourth as the Dodgers continued to press, but the Mets pushed their lead to 10-2 with a pair of runs in the bottom of the fourth and Los Angeles could never close the gap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Cleveland, Stanton crushed his fourth home run of this post-season to power the Yankees, hammering a three-run blast off Guardians relief pitcher Cade Smith to put them up 6-2 in the sixth inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smith had walked Juan Soto to open the inning. Yankees slugger Aaron Judge cranked a single before a sacrifice bunt from Jazz Chisholm brought up Stanton, who launched a fastball 404 feet into the left field seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, stunned by the Guardians' come-from-behind game three victory on Thursday, wasted no time, taking a 2-0 lead in the top of the first on Soto's two-run homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin Wells also homered for the Yankees, but the Guardians scored three runs in the seventh inning to pull within 6-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland tied it at 6-6 in the eighth when David Fry's soft infield hit was fielded clumsily by Yankees pitcher Mark Leiter, whose toss got past first baseman Anthony Rizzo to allow Fry to second as Bo Naylor – who opened the inning with a double – scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, trying to return to the World Series for the first time since winning their record 27th title in 2009, pushed across two runs in the top of the ninth against Cleveland's star closer Emmanuel Clase and held on for the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They can finish off the series with a victory in game five on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The key is to go play one more game – go out there and try to win that game," Soto said. "Forget about the series, just try to go out there and win the game ... that's all we need to do." (AFP)

    Skilled technicians to come and fill manpower shortage
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government plans to bring in 10,000 skilled technicians to ease the manpower shortage, adding that they hope to attract younger workers to bring down the average working age in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, he said that Hong Kong is projected to face a shortage of approximately 180,000 workers across different sectors in the future, with about 60,000 vacancies earmarked for skilled technicians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He stressed that the remaining 50,000 spots would be reserved for locals who are interested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are certain conditions for the people coming in. They must first have a licence, and secondly, they can only engage in their own industry when they come to Hong Kong. They cannot work in another field. This is the way to go," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We hope to choose younger people because we hope that they can work for a long time, and we want to make the workforce younger. That is very important for our future."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added that labour importation schemes are short-term solutions, and that they would continue to train local workers to alleviate the problem in the coming years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stated in the new Policy Address, the government will build a campus for the Hong Kong Institute of Information Technology, under the Vocational Training Council, and develop its Lift and Escalator Technology Centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said that both universities and the Vocational Training Council would also focus on the demand for high-tech talents, with institutions increasing incentives for research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "High technology plays a huge role in the development of our future, so whether it is in our universities, or through the Vocational Training Council, there will be courses catered to this type of demand. Even in our universities, we will add more scholarships for students to do some research and study for master's and doctoral degrees," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is mainly for the industries that we need. We will encourage them to do their best and provide them with more incentives to train and study in the future, and it's all towards high-tech development."

    New tourism working group to uncover hidden gems: CE

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A new working group on developing tourist hotspots will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong and will ease the workload of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Chief Executive John Lee said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his third Policy Address, Lee said the working group, led by Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk, will strengthen cross departmental co-ordination and leverage community efforts in identifying and developing tourist hotspots.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, the CE said officials hope to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For example, the Champs-Élysées in France... it has many unique features, and everyone goes there. Hong Kong of course has its own attractions. We already have Victoria Harbour, which we'll continue to develop," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But we also have many other treasures. How can we showcase our Geopark? We've discussed this before. There are many various aspects. We hope to pay more attention to public opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The policy blueprint also outlined plans to develop the SAR into an international tertiary education hub by creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked how to attract exchange students with the city's high cost of living, Lee said Hong Kong has much to offer with its freedom, convenience, and cultural diversity.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I like a girl because she's beautiful, sometimes because she's virtuous, and sometimes because of her knowledge. Hong Kong also appeals in many ways. Of course, we're not as big [geographically] as other big cities. That's the reality. But we still have many other appealing features," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On another radio programme, the CE was asked if he was dissatisfied that cultural and tourism officials failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Lee said, "When you look at the 2023 Policy Address, around four to five items are behind schedule. When I set indicators, I look at whether there are reasons for the delay and if those reasons are justified. The purpose is to make sure that we accomplish what we have promised to do."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It comes as, in the Policy Address annex, Lee pointed out the bureau "requires more time to revise the draft blueprint to cater for the long‑term development of the sector".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to queries about the matter on Friday, cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said the blueprint is "nearly complete" and he didn't feel that the CE had publicly urged him in any way.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 chalked up record closing highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq also in positive territory, as markets were boosted by an earnings-driven jump in Netflix shares and broader gains across technology stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major Wall Street benchmarks also comfortably secured a sixth straight weekly gain, their longest weekly winning streaks since late 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.09 percent s to close at 43,277. The S&P gained 0.4 percent to end at 5,864, while the Nasdaq rose 0.63 percent, to 18,488.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Netflix jumped 11.1 percent to a record closing high after the streaming giant topped Wall Street estimates for subscriber additions and said it expected continued growth through the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have driven much of Wall Street's rally this year, rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apple gained 1.2 percent after data showed a sharp increase in new iPhone sales in China, while chip heavyweight Nvidia advanced 0.8 percent after BofA Global Research hiked its price target on the stock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netflix's increase lifted the communication services sector 0.9 percent, making it the largest gainer among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, while information technology rose 0.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's kind of the 'what's not to like' market," said David Waddell, chief executive of Waddell & Associates, citing positive economic data, disinflation and upbeat earnings and forecasts from corporate America. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cuba on Friday experienced a nationwide blackout after the island's main power plant failed, causing the country's electricity grid to collapse, the energy ministry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The system was left without power nationwide" after the unexpected shutdown of the Antonio Guiteras power plant, Lazaro Guerra, director general of electricity at the ministry of energy and mines, told state television.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When the thermoelectric plant shut down "the system collapsed," he said, adding the government was working to restore service as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Manuel Marrero announced the island was in the throes of an "energy emergency," with severe supply shortages leaving some provinces without power for up to 20 hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government on Thursday suspended all non-essential public sector activities in order to prioritize electricity supply to homes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cuba gets its power from eight ageing thermal power plants, as well as seven floating plants leased from Turkish companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The island nation has been under a severe embargo by the United States since 1958. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An SUV driver who ran over a cyclist following an altercation in central Paris has been charged with murder after a court hearing, a source close to the case said on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 52-year-old driver of the SUV is accused of having deliberately targeted the cyclist, 27, on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another judge will now rule whether he should be held in custody ahead of trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuesday's incident in Paris's wealthy 8th district comes as tensions rise in the battle for street space in the congested capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tense exchanges between cyclists and drivers are commonplace in the city centre.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The driver, whose teenage daughter was also in the car, was arrested on the spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, the motorist and the cyclist were seen having an angry dispute by the side of the road.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   French associations promoting cycling have condemned the incident, with "Paris en Selle" calling it "an unacceptable tragedy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year, 226 cyclists died on French roads. (AFP)

   Kyiv said on Friday it had received the bodies of 501 servicemen killed fighting Russian forces, mainly in eastern Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed military personnel remains one of the few areas of cooperation between Moscow and Kyiv since Russia attacked in 2022.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a result of repatriation measures, 501 bodies of fallen Ukrainian defenders were returned to Ukraine," the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement represents one of the largest repatriations of killed Ukrainian servicemen since the beginning of the war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most of the remains were returned from the eastern Donetsk region, said the agency. Russian forces have been advancing steadily there since their capture of the industrial hub of Avdiivka in February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several state bodies had helped coordinate the return including the defence forces, the agency added, acknowledging the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Representatives of law enforcement agencies and forensic experts will identify the victims," the coordination centre said in its statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After identification, the bodies of our defenders will be handed over to their families for a proper burial." (AFP)

    Rugby to trial 20-minute red cards in November Tests

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Referees will have the option of awarding 20-minute red cards for technical offences during the Autumn Nations Series, organisers announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sport's global governing body World Rugby trialled the change in the Rugby Championship earlier this year, allowing a team to replace a red-carded player after 20 minutes in the sin-bin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Importantly for the Autumn Tests, which pitch southern hemisphere teams against those from the north, match officials will also retain the ability to award a permanent red card for acts of foul play which are deemed deliberate and dangerous.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The red card variation ensures that players deemed to commit deliberate and dangerous offences receive the full sanctioning, and subsequent disciplinary process, with the team being reduced to 14 men for the remainder of the game," Six Nations Rugby said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Referees will have the option to award a 20-minute red card for technical offences. This variation on the law trial will run throughout the Autumn Nation Series and differs to the standalone 20-minute red card proposal due to be discussed by the wider game later this year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   National unions in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand back the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there are others who oppose it, notably France and Ireland. The latter country's union said on Friday it did "not support the permanent adoption of a 20-minute red card," as proposed by World Rugby.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Player welfare and safety are paramount to the core values of the game and the option of a permanent red card for deliberate and intentional acts of foul play supports those values and protects the integrity of the game," the Irish union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The IRFU welcomes the variation to World Rugby's closed law trial," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other law trials on show in November include kickers having just 60 seconds to complete a penalty or a conversion, the latter with a countdown starting straight after a try is scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If a player exceeds this time limit, the conversion kick will be disallowed, while for a penalty, a scrum is awarded to the non-kicking team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will also be a scrum and line-out clock, with the set-pieces to be formed within 30 seconds of the referee and assistant officials making the respective mark. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday confirmed its leader Yahya Sinwar had been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, a day after Israel announced his death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We mourn the great leader, the martyred brother, Yahya Sinwar, Abu Ibrahim," Qatar-based Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya said in a recorded video statement broadcast by Al Jazeera.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinwar became Israel's most wanted man after the October 7, 2023 attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his statement, Hayya said Hamas would not release the hostages it seized from Israel during the attack until the war in Gaza ends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hostages "will not return... unless the aggression against our people in Gaza stops," the senior Hamas official said, as he called on Israel to withdraw from Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hayya said the militant group would take strength from Sinwar's killing, which he said has set him among "the leaders and symbols of the movement who preceded him." (AFP)

    Melioidosis to blame for monkey deaths: officials

  <img alt="Officials say there is no need to shut down the whole zoo, as the melioidosis-causing bacteria do not easily transmit from animals to humans. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775197_2_20241018200137.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Nine monkeys from the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, authorities revealed on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Part of the zoo has been shut down since Monday after eight monkeys, including three critically-endangered cotton-top tamarins, were found dead the previous day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One more death was registered later, while another monkey was taken away for observation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Subsequent autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung offered a possible explanation of where the bacteria came from.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said works performed at the zoo earlier this month required the digging up of soil near the monkeys' habitat. Workers were then believed to have brought contaminated soil into the cage through their shoes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Centre for Health Protection, the bacterium is particularly common in moist clay soil. It can affect both humans and animals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yeung stressed that it is not necessary to seal off the whole facility from the public.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have taken all the cleansing and disinfection measures on the cages. With all these measures, we believe that it's now clean and free of the bacteria," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have also cordoned off the whole mammals section for the time being, so there will be no sort of contact between normal citizens with the animals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Protective gear has been provided to staff after the incident, and those who may have had contact with the monkeys tested negative for the bacterium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas Sit, assistant director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, said operators had performed check-ups for the animals as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the animals lost appetite, they were a bit incompetent, quiet, abnormal, and the time of onset of all the clinical signs only took two days, and then there was a sudden death of the animals," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The vets already took measures to treat the monkeys. However, the affected monkeys could not make it and [we] had to perform post-mortem and isolate [them] to prevent the spread of the disease."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sit said the facility has been instructed to step up cleansing work, and staff should maintain good hygiene to avoid a repeat of the incident.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An infectious disease expert said the bacteria usually lie deep down in the soil, meaning contact with humans and animals was unlikely.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But if there had been work done to this soil with digging, and also if these bacteria in the deep soil had been elevated to the surface, then the animals there could have been exposed to a large number of bacteria, so that would probably have contributed to this outbreak in these monkeys," Wilson Lam told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It would be prudent to shut down the area temporarily, the doctor said, as the bacteria may still be present in the environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he played down fears of humans contracting the disease from monkeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Transmission from animals to human is really, really rare, so we are more worried about the presence of bacteria in the soil, and also the environment in the park at this moment."

    Kai Tak Sports Park to host test events this month
   </title>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung on Friday said there will be various test events at the Kai Tak Sports Park starting as early as the end of this month, to check transport facilities and crowd dispersal measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With mega events such as Coldplay concerts lined up for the sports park when it opens in the first quarter of next year, there have been calls for officials to improve transport solutions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yeung told a press conference that such efforts are underway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We may start with some small-scale games. For example, we have a smaller sports ground at Kai Tak with 5,000 seats. Some competitions will start to be held there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Of course during these so-called test events, we will try out the venue and its supporting facilities, and also things like crowd dispersal to see how we can do it best."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about a review of the redevelopment plan for Hong Kong Stadium – a move mentioned in this week's Policy Address – Yeung said officials need to examine how it can keep up with the city's development needs, and whether there are sufficient venues for mega events even after the Kai Tak site opens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the Policy Address annex, Chief Executive John Lee pointed out that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau failed to announce its Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development as scheduled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to questions about the matter, Yeung said the blueprint is nearly complete and he will follow the CE's instructions to finish it as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I don't think the chief executive has publicly urged me to do anything... I think everyone needs to be pragmatic. When the CE mentioned me yesterday, it was in response to questions about tourism work. He used tourism as an example. I was there yesterday too. He talked about the division of work between the relevant working groups and the bureau. I don't feel there was any urging there," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The blueprint, expected to be promulgated later this year, will outline the vision and initiatives for developing high-quality arts, cultural and creative industries.

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.

   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.

   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

   British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Beijing on an official two-day visit, with the UK's new Labour government seeking to demonstrate its willingness to engage in a pragmatic and strategic approach to ties with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit is only the second by a British foreign secretary in six years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the two sides would focus on implementing the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries during the phone talks in August, and have in-depth communication on enhancing strategic mutual trust and strengthening dialogue and cooperation in various fields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lammy's visit includes a meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing on Friday before visiting Shanghai to meet British businesses operating in China. (Xinhua/Reuters)
