<div class="itemFullText">
 A fire ripped through a karaoke bar in the Vietnamese capital, killing 11 people and injuring two others in a case of suspected arson, police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pictures on state media showed the blackened multi-storey building in western Hanoi, mostly destroyed by flames, and piles of twisted metal strewn nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they received reports of a fire at 11pm on Wednesday "with many people trapped inside".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue workers rushed to the scene and managed to bring out seven people alive, two of whom were rushed to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven others were found dead, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police suspect that the cafe was (deliberately) burned down and... have arrested the perpetrator," Hanoi police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witnesses told state media the fire was so large that no one dared to attempt to rescue those trapped inside. Photos from the scene showed that the building's balconies were enclosed with metal bars, likely making escape difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nguyen Minh Hung, who was nearby at the time, told the Dan Tri newspaper: "We were shouting for the trapped victims, but we heard no ask for help from inside the building."
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 fire trucks and ambulances sped to the scene, according to local media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire reportedly began on the first floor, before quickly spreading through the building. State media said CCTV footage from a nearby house showed a man carrying a bucket entering the premises shortly before the fire broke out.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspect was arrested around midnight, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man had gone to the karaoke bar to drink beer before arguing with staff, they added. He then allegedly bought petrol and poured it close to an area with many motorbikes, which burst into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident comes after six people, including four police officers, were jailed in October over a fire that ripped through a karaoke bar two years ago, killing 32 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blaze in a province close to business hub Ho Chi Minh City shocked Vietnam and led to the closure of thousands of karaoke bars nationwide for failing to meet fire regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the country's approximately 15,000 karaoke bars were forced to close, according to state media, citing police sources. (AFP)

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<img alt="The HKMA says a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784129_1_20241219102220.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rates cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.

    France races to find survivors in cyclone-hit Mayotte

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French President Emmanuel Macron will be in Mayotte on Thursday, his office said, as officials warned the death toll from the most destructive cyclone in living memory could reach hundreds - possibly thousands.
 <br>
  <br>
  France has declared "exceptional natural disaster" measures for Mayotte as authorities grapple with the full scale of the devastation wrought by Cyclone Chido on the Indian Ocean archipelago, racing against time to search for survivors and supply aid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" measures, announced by French overseas minister Francois-Noel Buffet on social media platform X, will ensure "faster and more effective management of the crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers raced on Wednesday to find survivors in the ruins of shanty towns while also unblocking roads and clearing rubble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulldozers were clearing the heliport of the island's only hospital, as residents were busy repairing their metal-sheet huts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Located near Madagascar off the coast of southeastern Africa, Mayotte is France's poorest region.
  <br>
  <br>
  A preliminary toll from France's interior ministry shows that 31 people have been confirmed killed, 45 seriously wounded and 1,373 suffering lighter injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But officials say the toll could rise exponentially. (AFP)

    US Supreme Court agrees to hear TikTok's appeal

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton, while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rare goals from Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Núñez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Núñez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliott doubled Liverpool in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game, after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UN envoy to Syria called on Wednesday for "free and fair" elections after the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad, voicing hope for a political solution for Kurdish-held areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Assad fled Syria following a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), more than 13 years after his crackdown on democracy protests precipitated one of the deadliest wars of the century.
  <br>
  <br>
  He left behind a country scarred by decades of torture, disappearances and summary executions, and the collapse of his rule on December 8 stunned the world and sparked celebrations around Syria and beyond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Years of civil war have also left the country heavily dependent on aid, deeply fragmented and desperate for justice and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing reporters in Damascus, UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said "there is a lot of hope that we can now see the beginning of a new Syria".
  <br>
  <br>
  "A new Syria that... will adopt a new constitution... and that we will have free and fair elections when that time comes, after a transitional period," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calling for immediate humanitarian assistance, he also said he hoped to see an end to international sanctions levied against Syria over Assad's abuses. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull announced Wednesday that under-pressure Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has departed the Formula One outfit after four seasons, with Liam Lawson tipped to become world champion Max Verstappen's new teammate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pérez, 34, joined Red Bull in 2021 and helped the team earn two constructors' titles and completed a drivers' standings one-two with four-time world champion Verstappen in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won five Grands Prix over 90 starts in Red Bull colours, including a victory at the Monaco GP and a double in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 season, Pérez and Red Bull signed a contract extension, tying the pair together until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Guadalajara-native's form dropped drastically after that deal and he picked up just nine points from his final eight race weekends.
  <br>
  <br>
  This dip in form led to rumours about his future in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came eighth in the drivers' standings as Red Bull surrendered their team title to McLaren with a third-placed finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pérez was adamant during his difficult period that he would stay with the team for next season but he will now part ways with Red Bull with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Pérez said. "Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together."
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran will not have a seat on the grid next season, but it remains to be seen whether he will sign a deal elsewhere for 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We'll meet again soon. And remember – never give up," Pérez added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen hailed his former teammate on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an absolute pleasure driving alongside you", the Dutchman wrote. "We've had some amazing moments together that I'll always remember. Thank you, Checo [Pérez]!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull said that "announcements regarding the team's full 2025 line-up will be made in due course".
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealander Lawson, who currently drives for Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls, is considered the favourite to replace Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old has earned three top-10 finishes so far in his fledgling F1 career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank Checo for all he has done for Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first 1-2 finish in the drivers' championship," the statement went on to read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo." (AFP)

<img alt="Real Madrid on the pitch after winning the Intercontinental Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784093_1_20241219053405.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  France striker Mbappé returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the Fifa Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for Concacaf Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vázquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is Madrid's second title of the season following their Uefa Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Muñoz for the most in club history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased, very happy. It's a success – that's more than anyone else," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the first edition of the Fifa-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year. They will return to the Middle East in early January for the four-team Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble as Fed eyes fewer 2025 rate cuts

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive after the Federal Reserve indicated fewer rate cuts next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784092_1_20241219053202.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates but also slashed the number of 2025 rate cuts in its forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly lower after the Fed projected just two interest rate cuts next year, down from four.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow slid 2.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, to 42,326.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 3.0 percent to 5,872, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.6 percent to 19,392.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seeing the kind of decline we are experiencing right now indicates that the Fed took the market quite by surprise," said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although stocks often enjoy a late-year bounce referred to as the "Santa Claus rally," Stovall said the depth of Wednesday's drop could spur more selling if traders take profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe Santa is already on vacation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank, as expected, moved ahead with a decision to reduce interest rates by a quarter point as Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered an upbeat appraisal of the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the announcement was coupled with the altered outlook on 2025 monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the latest interest rate cut, the Fed is now "significantly closer" to the point where no further cuts will be needed, said Powell, who emphasised the central bank still views two percent inflation as a critical long-term priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's reaction suggests the investors are "grappling" with the likelihood that interest rates "for all intents and purposes, are going to remain higher for longer," said Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's losses were broad-based with 29 of 30 companies in the Dow ending lower and all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finishing in the red. (AFP)

    CATL co-develops EV models with swappable batteries

<img alt="The hope is that the choco-swap battery swapping stations will use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784064_1_20241218212714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CATL said on Wednesday it had co-developed 10 new electric vehicle models with automakers that use swappable batteries, as the Chinese battery giant seeks to lead a trend it says will replace a third of petrol stations in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yang Jun, CEO of CATL's battery swapping brand Evogo, said it would roll out the first EV that uses its so-called "choco-swap" battery this month, with the remaining to be launched in upcoming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL will also look to build 1,000 battery swapping stations next year and to accelerate this further by enlisting partners to build more stations, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's largest battery maker has also been seeking to expand in new business sectors such as micro power grids and skateboard chassis, CATL's chairman Robin Zeng told Reuters in an interview in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the Evogo battery swap service in 2022, which it said would allow drivers to change EV batteries in one minute. Its automaker partners include state-owned Changan Auto and FAW and to date it has built a small number of charging stations across a few Chinese cities on a trial basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription fee for the choco-swap battery swapping service starts from 369 yuan (US$51) per month, Yang said at an event in China's southern city of Xiamen to talk about battery swapping. Zeng told the same event that the batteries would come with two standard sizes to speed up adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope, Zeng added, was that the choco-swap battery swapping stations would use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  China could eventually have 30,000-40,000 battery swapping stations which could replace a third of its roughly 100,000 petrol stations, Yang predicted. Zeng said that he expected battery swapping to make up a third of power-up solutions for EVs alongside home and public chargers by 2030. (Reuters)

<img alt="This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784091_1_20241219051243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, amid uncertainty about inflation and President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers voted 11-to-1 to lower the US central bank's key lending rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In updated economic forecasts, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee pencilled in just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of four, and hiked their inflation outlook for next year, from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed has made progress in tackling inflation through interest rate hikes in the last two years, and recently began paring back rates to boost demand in the economy and support the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent, and raising concerns that the US central bank's battle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump, whose economic proposals include tariff hikes and the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  These plans, combined with the recent uptick in inflation data, led some analysts to pare back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 ahead of Wednesday's meeting, predicting that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

    Court rules police can seize assets from Andrew Tate

<img alt="A British court has ruled that Andrew Tate (left) and his brother Tristan (right) can have their assets seized to pay millions in back taxes. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784059_1_20241218204300.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British court ruled Wednesday that police can seize more than 2.6 million pounds (US$3.3 million) to cover years of unpaid taxes from influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Devon and Cornwall Police force went to court to claim the money, held in seven frozen bank accounts, from the Tates and a woman identified only as J.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Westminster Magistrates’ Court, Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring ruled that financial transactions by the brothers, including transferring almost US$12 million into an account in the name of J, were a “straightforward cheat” of the tax authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the force said that the Tates were “serial” tax evaders who failed to pay any tax on 21 million pounds in revenue from their online businesses, including War Room, Hustlers’ University, Cobra Tate and OnlyFans, between 2014 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate, 38, accused the government of “outright theft” for freezing his accounts and seizing “everything they could.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is not justice; it’s a coordinated attack on anyone who dares to challenge the system," Tate said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This raises serious questions about the lengths authorities will go to silence dissent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hearing in July, attorney Sarah Clarke quoted from a video posted online by Andrew Tate, in which he said: “When I lived in England I refused to pay tax.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She said J — who can't be named because of a court order — wasn't involved with the brothers' businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for the brothers, Martin Evans, argued that the bank transfers were “entirely orthodox” for people who run online businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the siblings spent money on a number of “exotic motor cars,” but did nothing illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceedings are civil, which carries a lower standard of proof than criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Tate is a former kickboxer and dual British-US citizen who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has been banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook after the platforms accused him of posting hate speech and misogynistic comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He and Tristan Tate, 36, face criminal allegations in Romania , including human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are set to be extradited to the UK once those proceedings are over to face further allegations of rape and human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tates deny all the allegations. (AP)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday greeted members of the public as he visited a panda carnival in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee visited several stalls at the fair, chatted with their operators as well as passers-by, took selfies with them and bought 38 panda dolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also went to a bar, had a drink and talked to a customer from Sweden who was in Hong Kong to develop her design business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have long stays. We have short stays. That's Hong Kong. In fact, this is the world. Looking around, people are so mobile, so they tend to really float around. It's a global village," Lee told the Swedish visitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I'm very glad to see that you are bringing Swedish culture [to the city]. That is what Hong Kong people love - to try everything. They appreciate the different characteristics of different countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Lee's second district visit in a week.

    Kai Tak Sports Park preps for first concert

<img alt="Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784025_2_20241218170246.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowd control and set-up procedures are just a few of the measures that authorities will be taking note of, as Kai Tak Arena prepares for its inaugural concert on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said around 5,500 ticket holders are expected to attend the Chill Thai Music Festival, featuring local boy band Mirror.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4.30pm, with the performance set to start at 6.30pm and wrap up before 10pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said the arrangements for sporting events and concerts differ significantly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For concert events, it involves more set-ups, the stage arrangement, which we do not have during the sports events. There's also rehearsals that we are going to test for a concert event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from the above, the spectators' arrival and dispersal patterns of concert events are quite different from typical sports events."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi said concert goers should have already gotten their tickets in advance, adding that there will be no on-site ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the ticketing arrangements for these concerts, they are all distributed through the events organisers, so participants and spectators should have got their tickets by now. They are not required to get their tickets on site," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this arrangement would ensure orderly pedestrian flow during the concerts and during the starting time of the concerts."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reminded attendees that umbrellas, outside food and drink, water bottles, professional photography equipment, and support signs larger than 38cm long, 20cm wide and 30cm high are prohibited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added these restrictions align with those at concerts held at AsiaWorld-Expo and the Hong Kong Coliseum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kai Tak Mall had its soft opening on Wednesday, featuring a sports recreation facility and around 200 shops with over 80 percent leased.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Wong, head of retail at Kai Tak Sports Park, said the mall would discuss flexible operating hours with merchants during major events and performances, adding the mall can maintain a steady flow of visitors before and after shows and games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mall allows customers to come earlier to shop and enjoy meals. They don't have to come last minute just for their event. It's to give people more diverse options and creates a better experience," she said.

    Japanese startup's space rocket launch fails

<img alt="Japan's Space One's small, solid-fueled Kairos rocket lifts off at Space One's launching pad on the tip of Kii peninsula in Kushimoto town, Wakayama prefecture. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784026_1_20241218170424.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Space One terminated the flight of its Kairos small rocket shortly after liftoff on Wednesday, marking the end of its second attempt in nine months to become the country's first company to deliver a satellite to space with a privately-developed rocket.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the latest in a series of recent setbacks for Japanese rocket development, even as the government pushes for 30 rocket launches annually and an 8 trillion yen (US$52 billion) space industry by the early 2030s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kairos rocket self-destructed about three minutes into the flight, after it detected abnormalities in the first-stage engine nozzle control and the rocket's trajectory, Space One director Mamoru Endo said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live images from the local Wakayama prefecture government had shown the 18-metre solid-propellant rocket blasting off from Spaceport Kii in western Japan at 11am, but whirling during its ascent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cause of the failure remains unclear and requires further investigation, Endo said, adding that Kairos probably flew to an altitude of more than 100 kilometres until the self-destruct system kicked in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five small satellites were on board the rocket, which was headed into sun-synchronous orbit roughly 500 kilometres above the Earth's surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-based Space One was founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, IHI's aerospace unit, construction firm Shimizu and a state-backed bank, with the goal of launching 20 small rockets a year by 2029 to capture growing satellite launch demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  At its debut flight in March, Kairos, carrying a Japanese government satellite, exploded five seconds after launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inappropriate flight settings triggered the rocket's autonomous self-destruct system even though no issues were found in its hardware, Space One later said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't see what happened this time as a failure," company president Masakazu Toyoda told reporters on Wednesday, repeating the phrase he used in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the data from the failed launch would be useful for a third mission and that another attempt was on the cards. (Reuters)

    'Stay alert to promises made by sports bodies'

 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok on Wednesday urged young athletes and their parents to remain vigilant when signing contracts with sports bodies.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the family of a young skateboarder successfully terminated a contract with a local association for the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  It claimed to be able to nominate the athlete to compete in international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The chairman of the association told me that he had the authorisation to nominate my daughter to participate in the Asian Games and even the Olympic Games. Everything went through a phone call, but this is the main reason why I signed the contract without deep thinking," the athlete's father surnamed Su said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Su signed the five-year contract back in 2021. However, no regular training was provided for his daughter, and he was asked to pay more than HK$100,000 for training and enter competitions that anyone could sign up for themselves. He said he never received any receipts regarding his payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Su expressed his wish to terminate the contract this February, the sports body raised harsh conditions on his daughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They demanded us to either pay HK$300,000 as a termination fee, or my daughter [would] not [be] involved in any skateboarding activity in a year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A termination agreement was made in July after lawyers got involved in the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said parents can refer to membership information under sports associations to verify the authenticity of various sports bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If in doubt, [parents] can contact SF&OC (Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China) or responsible national sports associations, to inquire more about the association or entity that you are involved with, to make sure that they are promoting the sports in a positive way, and not making any alternative claims that may not meet their expectation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome different sports entities, stakeholders to contribute to sports in Hong Kong. Everyone has a right to push sports. But if such organisations are making claims, do double check and stay alert," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Wednesday shot down a lawmaker's suggestion that people fined for carrying out large-scale unauthorised building works be allowed to keep them if they aren't considered dangerous.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is hoping lawmakers will agree to amend the Buildings Ordinance. Under its proposal, the maximum fine for unauthorised building projects will go up from HK$400,000 to HK$2 million, alongside the existing risk of a two-year prison term.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco development panel meeting, legislator Wendy Hong asked whether people could be exempt from demolishing or rectifying large-scale illegal structures that do not pose any danger after they pay the fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linn said the government does not want to "go down such a route" or mislead future generations into thinking they can "pay to break the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  It is also difficult to guarantee the long-term structural integrity of the works, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A professional may be able to inspect it (unauthorised building works) with the naked eye and say that it is safe, but don't forget that at the time of construction, no building plan was submitted and probably they didn't have any construction records," Linn explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the meeting, Linn also reassured owners' corporations that they will not be prosecuted immediately after being served a notice to carry out mandatory building inspection, as long as they begin to take action.

    25 arrests over suspected fake certificates since 2022

 The government said on Wednesday that 25 people have been arrested over the past three years on suspicion of using fake qualifications to apply for places at tertiary institutions in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charges were laid against eight of them, with three convictions and five people on bail pending trial. The rest of the cases are still under investigation, the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legislative Council meeting, lawmakers said many mainland intermediaries claim they can guarantee university admissions, as well as successful entry to Hong Kong through different talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unionist lawmaker Chau Siu-chung asked whether the government has enough manpower to conduct checks on admissions, noting that some of those who moved to Hong Kong through the talent programmes are due to have their visas renewed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting security minister Michael Cheuk said in response that officers will step up inspections, adding that the authorities have been working closely with their mainland counterparts and that they conduct joint enforcement action in a timely manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As at 10 December 2024, the police had referred information of a total of 14 mainland intermediary agencies or intermediaries to the relevant mainland authorities for follow-up," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In respect of the recent cases involving false proof and unscrupulous intermediaries, the Immigration Department has been maintaining close communication and exchanging intelligence with the relevant mainland authorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also stressed that the Education Bureau has told tertiary institutions to adopt enhanced measures, such as requiring applicants to submit third-party verification proof before admission.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia has detained an Uzbek citizen who investigators believe placed the bomb which killed General Igor Kirillov on the instructions of Ukraine's security service, Moscow's Investigative Committee said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A national of Uzbekistan, born in 1995, was arrested on suspicion of having committed the attack that cost the life of the commander of Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, Igor Kirillov, and his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov", the Investigative Committee said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man said he had been "recruited by Ukrainian special forces", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov and his assistant were killed on Tuesday as they walked out of a Moscow apartment building early in the morning, after an explosive device attached to a scooter went off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement said that the suspect told interrogators that he had come to Moscow to carry out the attack and that a camera mounted on the dashboard of a rented car parked outside the building had filmed the attack and streamed it "live to the attack organisers, in the (Ukrainian) city of Dnipro".
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was promised US$100,000 to carry out the attack, as well as the possibility to settle "in a European country", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov was the most senior military figure assassinated in Russia since the conflict with Ukraine began nearly three years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov, 54, was the head of the Russian army's chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit and was recently sanctioned by Britain over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. (Agencies)

<img alt="Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are in preliminary merger talks as a way to deal with the growing competition to their business from EVs. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784003_1_20241218151346.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Honda and Nissan are in talks to deepen ties, media reports said on Wednesday, including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of how Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  A combined Honda and Nissan would create a US$54 billion company with annual output of 7.4 million vehicles, making it the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two firms had already forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan's deepening financial and strategic trouble in recent months has added more urgency for closer cooperation with larger rival Honda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan announced a US$2.6 billion cost savings plan last month that includes cutting 9,000 jobs and 20 percent of its global production capacity, as slumping sales in China and the US led to a 85 percent plunge in second-quarter profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but Honda itself is not resting on its laurels," said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at Itochu Research Institute. "Honda's cash flow is set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven't been going so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nissan closed nearly 24 percent higher in Tokyo trade on Wednesday, while shares of Honda, whose market value of US$43 billion is more than four times bigger than that of Nissan, declined three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Mitsubishi gained nearly 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automakers have been grappling with challenges from EV makers, particularly in China, where BYD and others have surged ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Honda and Nissan, first reported by the Nikkei newspaper, would allow the companies to cooperate more on technology and help them create a more formidable domestic rival to Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discussions are focused on finding ways to bolster collaboration and include the possibility of setting up a holding company, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies are also discussing the possibility of full merger, according to one of the people, as well as looking at ways to cooperate with Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi said no deal had been announced by any of the companies, though Nissan and Mitsubishi noted the three automakers had said previously they were considering opportunities for future collaboration.
  <br>
  <br>
  French automaker Renault, a major Nissan shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three Japanese automakers are expected to hold a joint news conference in Tokyo on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Reuters)

    Sports events get priority for HK Coliseum, says govt

<img alt="The government says the Hong Kong Coliseum has been in full use in recent years. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783986_1_20241218135336.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the sports sector gets priority when it comes to booking the Hong Kong Coliseum, after a lawmaker complained that organisers turned away are instead taking their events to Macau or Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho noted that the Coliseum is also in high demand for concerts, arts and cultural events and said some in these sectors aren't sure why they find it hard to secure the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to his questions, culture and sports minister Rosanna Law said 461 booking applications – around 80 percent of the total received – have been rejected since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she added that throughout this period, the venue has been in constant use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of the successful bookings were for concerts, while around a fifth were for large-scale sporting events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[The Leisure and Cultural Services Department] considers the nature, significance and attraction of the events, audience appeal of the performers and booking history of the applicants, et cetera, when more than one organisation applies for the same time slot," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the Coliseum is regarded as an important sports venue and events in this category therefore get priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said she expects event organisers will welcome the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park next year, and officials will work with the operator to promote the site for local and international events.

    Giannis stars as Bucks beat Thunder to win NBA Cup

<img alt="Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with a triple-double in the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783979_1_20241218123712.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks silenced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second half to win the second edition of the NBA Cup with a 97-81 victory in Las Vegas on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo delivered a triple-double of 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists along with two steals and three blocked shots for the Bucks, who drilled 17 three-pointers to complete an unbeaten run and follow in the footsteps of the Los Angeles Lakers as in-season tournament champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard scored 23 points for the Bucks, who held the potentially explosive Thunder offense to 31 points in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's who we are," Antetokounmpo said of the Bucks' second-half surge, which saw them push a one-point lead at halftime to as many as 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points and Jalen Williams added 18 but, with the Bucks thwarting them inside, Oklahoma City were ultimately doomed by their poor long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The triumph was a vindication for the Bucks, who were stung by the Indiana Pacers in last year's Cup semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were the only team from last season's semis to make it back to the final four in Vegas, beating the Orlando Magic in the quarter-finals and dispatching Atlanta in the semis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their Cup success has been part of a massive turnaround after a dismal 2-8 start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have now won 13 of their last 16 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the rest of the Cup matches, the final doesn't count toward the regular-season record, nor do the players' performances count in their career stats.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trophy does come with a financial reward with each player on the winning team set to pocket more than US$514,971 – a significant chunk of money for the younger players and lesser lights on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder players will take home US$205,988 apiece for the runner-up finish. (AFP)

    'Set up one-stop platform for after-death procedures'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ombudsman Jack Chan on Wednesday urged the government to set up a one-stop thematic website for after-death arrangements so the public do not have to go to various sites to get information.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's office investigated public services relating to after-death arrangements, including death registrations, mortuary services, cremations and burial services.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that these services are provided by different government departments, and people seeking information might have to check with each one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department launched its own after-death arrangements thematic website in November, but the authorities should set up a website coordinating services by all the various departments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It would be most useful and helpful to the bereaved families if there's one thematic interdepartmental website so that the family could just use that website to gather all the essential information," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second recommendation is to provide a digital form for the bereaved family to apply for different certificates and procedures, instead of having to go to different departments and authorities to apply for different certifications or whatever document they need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also suggested the government provide more electronic application procedures to make services more convenient for the public.

    HK has role to play for Middle East businesses: FS

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday that Hong Kong can expand into the Middle East market by providing risk assessment and financial services.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the RTHK programme Overview Policy, he said companies in the Middle East are eager to invest in China, Hong Kong and other Asian markets due to intensifying geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan earlier visited Europe, the United States, Australia and the Middle East, with the aim of strengthening ties with traditional markets, as well as exploring new markets and capital sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In our exchanges, business leaders [in the Middle East] learnt about the real situation of how One Country, Two Systems is implemented in Hong Kong, and what can we do for them in terms of investing in mainland China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Entering and leaving Hong Kong is very easy, such as they can get to Shanghai and return on the same day through Hong Kong. On the other hand, we can provide them with professional services that are targeted towards the mainland and Asian markets, to be their guide and assess different kinds of risks."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investments from Europe and the United States have continued to pour into Hong Kong, despite negative claims by Western media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When stock market performances improved earlier, more than 80 percent of capital came from Europe and America. Moreover, in terms of asset and investment management, a lot of international banks expanded their operations here. That's because the Greater Bay Area's economic development is quick, and people here are relatively more wealthy among all of China," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to separate politics and the financial sector. Companies may express their own political views, but they also want returns in business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government is working hard to improve the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We discussed with mainland authorities to expand the Individual Visit Scheme to more cities, and increase their duty-free allowance. We have also been attracting strategic enterprises since 2002, offered the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, and hosted events such as the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in November," he said.

 A charity that provides health behavioural education for children and their caregivers is seeking support to help those with special education needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Be Priceless is one of the 11 beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), an annual charity campaign holding fundraising projects for over 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The founder of the organisation, Dr Czarina Leung, said Be Priceless is supporting children and carers through its SEED programme, which stands for self-value, empower, educate, and protect from dangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We teach them how to prevent, prepare, respond and recover from mental disorder, physical disorder, as well as relational safety issues including bullying and violence," Leung told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said her organisation provided long-term workshops for children and their carers, especially when they are transitioning into a new phase in life.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that with more support, her organisation would expand its network and help more children, including those with visual impairments and other disabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foundation said Be Priceless would support 125 children and youth with special education needs, and 195 caregivers of the children.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has shelved a plan to introduce technology that can detect invalid votes, a day after lawmakers expressed privacy concerns at a Legislative Council meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau had planned to table legal changes by March, in part to bring in smart ballot boxes for polls.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Legco meeting on Monday, some lawmakers said they were concerned about confidentiality, warning that a voter suspected of casting an invalid vote could easily be spotted at a polling station.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials didn't explain how the new voting process would work, how votes could remain confidential or which elections the smart boxes would be used for.
  <br>
  <br>
  A bureau spokesman said late on Tuesday that the boxes will not be introduced after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After listening to the views from lawmakers and the public, the government is willing to be receptive to the views," he said, stressing that the government highly values public opinion on its governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has decided to continue to provide ballot checking devices for voters, and they can use them on a voluntary basis if that's necessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years, such checking devices have been used in the District Committee constituency in district council polls as well as Legco's Election Committee constituency.

 Shenzhou-19 crew members aboard China's orbiting space station completed the first extravehicular activities (EVAs) of their mission at 9.57pm Beijing time on Tuesday, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze worked for nine hours on completing multiple tasks, including the installation of space-debris protection devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were assisted by the space station's robotic arm and a team on Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cai and Song, the two crew members assigned the EVA duty, have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission of the first EVAs of the Shenzhou-19 crew was a complete success, setting a new record for the duration of EVAs by Chinese astronauts, said the CMSA.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marked Cai's second EVAs in space, following his initial EVAs during the Shenzhou-14 mission two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Song became the first Chinese astronaut born after 1990 to carry out EVAs, said the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 crew is set to carry out a slew of scheduled space-science experiments and technical tests, while they will also undertake additional EVAs and install payloads outside the space station, the agency added. (Xinhua)

    Vinicius, Bonmatí named Fifa best players of the year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid attacker Vinicius Junior won the Fifa men's player of the year award at a ceremony in Doha on Tuesday, while Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmatí picked up the women's prize for the second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The award comes two months after 24-year-old Vinicius was second in the Ballon d'Or, with Real electing to snub the ceremony when they found out beforehand that Manchester City midfielder Rodri was set to win the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Brazilian was this time on hand to collect the prize in person as he is in Qatar with his club ahead of their Intercontinental Cup final clash with Mexico's Pachuca.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you very much. I don't know where to start," Vinicius said on stage. "It was impossible to think of getting here. I grew up in a world of poverty, of organised crime. It's for all the children who grow up in that world – I thank everyone who voted for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to my family, to the club, to my teammates, to Carletto [Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti], who always helps me," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to everyone who helped make my dream come true. I hope to be at Madrid for many years, because it is the best club in the world," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to Flamengo, my first club in Brazil, and to my teammates in my national team and country who always support my work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius succeeds Lionel Messi as the Fifa men's player, after the Argentinian scooped up the last two editions of the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live wire forward scored 24 goals and laid on 11 assists in 39 matches across all competitions as he led Real to a La Liga and Champions League double last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spain's Bonmatí picked up the women's player award for the second year running, adding to the two Ballon d'Or trophies she already boasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful, I'm proud to receive this award," Bonmatí said via video link from Barcelona's Olympic stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last term, Bonmatí led Barcelona to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claimed the Nations League with her national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  She won every trophy available to her in club football in the 2023 to 2024 season – the Spanish league, the Copa de la Reina, the Supercopa de España and a second-successive Women's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmatí scored a goal and put in a player-of-the-match performance, as Barcelona beat Lyon 2-0 in the final of the Champions League to claim their third title in four seasons. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks retreated on Tuesday despite solid US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq pulled back from its record in the prior session and was joined lower by the S&P 500 and the Dow, which fell for its ninth straight session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just sort of a pause here," said Art Hogan from B Riley Wealth Management, who noted equities had rallied after the US presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.6 percent at 43,449.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.4 percent to 6,050, while the Nasdaq shed 0.3 percent to 20,109.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates again on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the US central bank's monetary policy outlook projects additional cuts in 2025 in line with expectations, Hogan said stocks could rally Wednesday; but a disappointing forecast could send stocks lower, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales rose 0.7 percent in November from a month earlier, up from a revised 0.5 percent in October and above analysts' forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts attributed the positive numbers in part to the speedy resolution of the US presidential contest.
  <br>

  Among individual companies, Pfizer jumped 4.8 percent as it projected slightly higher profits in 2025 compared with this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online e-commerce platform eBay won 0.9 percent after announcing the board authorised an additional 43 billion for share repurchases. (AFP)

    Walmart, Meituan team up to boost e-commerce sales

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart said on Tuesday it had formed a strategic partnership with Meituan, under which the Chinese firm has begun providing delivery services for Walmart goods and the US company will be featured on its popular app.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move will help Walmart accelerate its e-commerce business in China, which accounts for nearly half of its sales in the country, Walmart's China unit said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership follows Walmart's sale of a stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com for US$3.7 billion in August, allowing it to diversify beyond JD's logistics services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meituan is China's biggest food delivery company but also provides a host of other services that range from deliveries of other goods to bike-sharing and ticket booking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the company most Chinese consumers turn to when they want a quick delivery of basic household items and Walmart will become more visible by being on the Meituan app, said Jason Yu, general manager at CTR Market Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart last month reported that quarterly net sales in China, including sales from both Walmart and its members-only Sam's Club stores, surged 17 percent to US$4.9 billion. (Reuters)

<img alt="Adele is being sued for lost royalties, US$160,000 in moral damages, plus a songwriting credit on her track. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783901_1_20241217214109.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Brazilian judge has ordered a song by British pop superstar Adele, "Million Years Ago", be pulled worldwide – including on streaming services – over an ongoing plagiarism claim by a Brazilian composer.
 <br>
  <br>
  The injunction threatens the Brazilian subsidiaries of Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music, Adele's labels, with a fine of US$8,000 "per act of non-compliance."
  <br>
  <br>
  The music companies, however, can still appeal the decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  The injunction was made by Judge Victor Torres on Friday, in Rio de Janeiro's 6th Commercial Court, pending further activity in the continuing plagiarism case.
  <br>
  <br>
  His preliminary injunction, orders Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music to stop "immediately and globally, from using, reproducing, editing, distributing or commercialising the song 'Million Years Ago', by any modality, means, physical or digital support, streaming or sharing platform".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a landmark for Brazilian music, which... has often been copied to compose successful international hits," said Fredimio Trotta, the lawyer for Brazilian composer Toninho Geraes who brought the plagiarism complaint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trotta said his firm this week will work to ensure that radio and television broadcasters, and streaming services around the world, are alerted to the Brazilian ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  His client Geraes claims Adele's 2015 song plagiarised the music of his samba classic "Mulheres" ("Women"), recorded by famous Brazilian singer Martinho da Vila on a 1995 hit album.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geraes is suing for lost royalties, US$160,000 in moral damages, plus songwriting credit on Adele's track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sony Music Entertainment Brazil said it did "not have a statement at this time," while Universal Music Brazil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trotta said the injunction should have a chilling effect on foreign singers and labels looking to rip off Brazilian tunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "International producers and artists who... have Brazilian music 'on their radar' for possible parasitic use will think twice, given this decision," the lawyer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adele was also accused by Turkish music fans of plagiarism in "Million Years Ago" back in 2015. They claimed its tune was similar to one in a 1985 song by a Kurdish singer, Ahmet Kaya, called "Acilara Tutunmak" ("Clinging to Pain").
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaya died in exile in France in 2000, and his widow said it was unlikely a global star like Adele would do such a thing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil is a signatory to the 1886 Berne Convention that agrees international protection for copyrighted works. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR on Tuesday said its trains will run overnight on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve to facilitate commuters participating in festive celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said trains on eight railway lines will run more frequently from 3pm on December 24 and 31, and overnight services will be provided, except for the Airport Express, Disneyland Resort Line and the section between Sheung Shui, Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said 2,200 additional train trips will be provided on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that train services will be gradually enhanced from Friday until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier said it had submitted requests to mainland authorities on extending the service hours at two border checkpoints on New Year’s Eve, and the MTR said it would make further arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In alignment with the proposed extension of operating hours of the Lo Wu checkpoint to 2am, the MTR will make corresponding service arrangements."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further details will be announced in due course," it said in a statement.

 Hong Kong, China have booked a place in the finals of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship in South Korea next year after they crushed Guam in the finale of the qualifying round of the tournament, which the city hosted this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal in each half from Tai Po midfielder Philip Chan, as well as strikes from Benavides Medeiros, Everton Camargo and Dudu, helped seal the 5-0 victory at Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a perfect run in the preliminary competition, with the hosts having beaten Mongolia and Chinese Taipei in their previous matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the sixth straight win under head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR can now look forward to the EAFF E-1 finals in July 2025, when they will face Asian powerhouses South Korea, Japan and China.

<img alt="Researchers are hoping to give AI-powered check-ups to elderly people who have trouble visiting dentists. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783892_1_20241217195648.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong has developed a new AI-powered mobile app that it says can reliably assess the oral health of patients in seconds.
 <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three months, volunteers are hoping to use the app to help hundreds of elderly patients who have difficulty visiting a dentist – by making home visits or at three service locations in Lam Tin and Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Students from HKU’s dentistry faculty are partnering up with legislators and district councillors to identify elderly people in need of help.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volunteers would then do a quick test simply by taking photos of the patients’ mouths and running it through the app – called GUM AI – which would then make an accurate assessment of the state of their teeth and gums.
  <br>
  <br>
  No professional training is needed – the app simply displays red for poor oral health, yellow when caution is required, and green means everything looks fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The service teams would then give advice to the patients, or refer them to a dentist if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKU researcher Walter Lam says the technology could make a real difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the GUM AI can raise health awareness among those elderly, so that they can have a regular dental visit, and they can self-care their hygiene, which is quite important to prevent any oral diseases," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developers of the app say it has proven to be highly reliable, with a 90-percent accuracy rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The accuracy of our AI system is comparable to experienced dentists," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is aiming to expand the use of the app to other age groups after the end of the three-month pilot project. They say the technology promises to reduce waiting times for oral check-ups, and can help people better monitor their oral health and get treatment early.

    China rejects spy allegations involving Prince Andrew

<img alt="The Foreign Ministry rejected accusations that a Chinese national said to have close ties with Britain's Prince Andrew (pictured) had been spying for China.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday labelled as "preposterous" claims that a Chinese businessman had used his links with Britain's Prince Andrew to spy for Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The development of China-UK relations is in the common interests of both countries and is also conducive to promoting world economic growth and responding to global challenges," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United Kingdom will work with China to accumulate more positive factors and demonstrate the two countries' innate character of cooperation, mutual benefits and common wins," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the man at the centre of the row, Yang Tengbo, said he had done nothing wrong and was not a spy, after he was named in a British court as being a suspected Chinese agent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang, described in a ruling last week by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission as a "close confidant" of Andrew, waived his right to anonymity on Monday so he could respond to the accusation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the Home Office against me are ill-founded," he said in a statement released by his lawyer, referring to Britain's interior ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The widespread description of me as a 'spy' is entirely untrue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, British judges upheld a 2023 ban on Yang entering the UK, ruling that the the government had been "entitled to conclude that his exclusion was justified and proportionate". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A counter-terrorism drill held at Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Tuesday saw the authorities tackling terrorists opening fire from the stands and the discovery of a backpack containing a suspicious device.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police, fire, customs, immigration, prison and Government Flying Service officers took part in the simulation, aimed at strengthening their capability to handle emergencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior police superintendent Peter Leung, from the inter-departmental counter terrorism unit, said the current terrorist threat level in Hong Kong is "moderate", indicating that while an attack is possible, there is no specific information suggesting the city is being targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to invite more different government departments and also the public and private sectors as well as the members of public to participate in this kind of CT [counter-terrorism] exercise because I think we have to promote the inter-departmental cooperation in the prevention of terrorist attacks," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said public participation in counter-terrorism exercises is crucial for raising awareness and understanding terrorism trends, adding that the drills help equip the community to prevent terrorist activities.

    Police plan to put up 7,000 CCTVs in HK by 2027

<img alt="Leung Ming-leung says police plan to install 7,000 CCTV cameras around Hong Kong by the end of 2027. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783865_1_20241217170256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they plan to install up to 7,000 surveillance cameras across Hong Kong in roughly three years' time, up from the more than 600 put up since the start of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had said the plan was to add 2,000 cameras each year from 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  At an Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) meeting, operations senior superintendent, Leung Ming-leung, said CCTV cameras are currently being put up on regular and smart lamp posts, government premises and transport interchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers will look to put other cameras up on places like traffic lights, highway signboards and camera boxes to catch drivers running a red light.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said they are also looking into connecting cameras installed by other government departments to the police's CCTV system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said whether more cameras would be added beyond 2027 would depend on the situation at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a lot of time before 2027. It all depends on the actual situation, the number may be more, the number may be adjusted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The speed with which we'll install the CCTV would hinge on the development of technology. Now the plan covers a horizon up to 2027, and closer to [that time], we are going to be having the latest thinking that we can bring members up to date on."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said the force's CCTV cameras can record sound, but so far police have not used this function.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said police will refer to overseas examples and operational needs going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  An IPCC member, Matthew Lam, asked whether Hong Kong would follow the example of Singapore in using facial recognition, for example at stadiums in the SAR where mega events take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Leung said he thinks what Lam has in mind will come to fruition soon, saying the force will adopt technology that's proven successful elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked what would happen if the police's system was hacked, Leung said the surveillance footage is encrypted and can only be viewed with special devices within the force.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the police attach great importance to privacy, saying when private places are filmed, the areas will be masked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage in general will be kept for 31 days - unless it's useful in criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung went on to say the installation of the cameras since the start of the year has been highly effective, saying 97 cases were resolved with their help, including serious crimes such as murder, arson and burglary.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism sector representatives on Tuesday called on the government to allow more tour groups to access sights and attractions, to further promote eco-tourism and cultural tourism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Perry Yiu, together with the New Youth Forum, surveyed over 800 local people between mid-November and early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 80 percent of interviewees agreed that Hong Kong has rich tourism resources, including historic buildings, monuments, natural resources and the coastline.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the tourism representatives said there are currently many restrictions on tour groups, for instance, only three coaches are allowed to enter the Hong Kong Geopark in Sai Kung each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Travel Industry Council (TIC) chairman Tommy Tam said individual travellers may not be familiar with non-mainstream attractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some travel agents, they do have some experience and they are well-trained tour guides. They can escort [tourists], so we believe that they can benefit if they join the package or the tour organised by tour operators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derek Tse, a training committee member of the TIC, said tour guides can raise the attractiveness of sights by letting visitors learn about their history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also encourage in-depth education elements and also conservation. So throughout these five years, no matter the TIC, or the Hong Kong Tourism Board has supported some training for the local guides on cultural tourism," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives said the sector has introduced more in-depth tours amid the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and they hope the tours will attract people to stay in Hong Kong for a longer period.

<img alt="With the computing system, aerial photos are digitised and practitioners can wear a pair of 3D glasses to conduct an analysis. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783856_2_20241217163433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new tool that digitises print aerial photos can improve slope safety management and help prepare for extreme weather events, the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The office's Digital Aerial Photographs Interpretation System was paid for by the government’s Innovation and Technology Fund and cost HK$6.5 million to develop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GEO’s library has 370,000 paper-based aerial photos and an average of 17,000 are loaned to other government departments and the engineering sector every month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over time, pairs of aerial photos have been used together to draw geology maps, and form 3D models for slope management as well as landslide risk assessments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Practitioners in the past had to rely on their eyes to carry out the analysis, which could be tough for those who are inexperienced, GEO deputy head Jenny Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the new computing system can enhance the speed and accuracy of an analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The system will enhance the accuracy and provide more information to technical practitioners because from the digitised aerial photographs, you can see more information such as height and the coordinates,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that in future, people who want to access the data will be able to do so from their office, avoiding a trip to the library.
  <br>
  <br>
  70,000 aerial photos dating from 1963 to the present have been uploaded in the system so far, and they will be available for use by the end of this month.

 The Executive Council on Tuesday gave the green light for three bus companies to increase their fares, although the hikes are smaller than what some of them had sought.
 <br>
  <br>
  Citybus can increase fares by 7.5 percent, while New Lantao Bus and KMB can raise theirs by 6.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new fares will take effect on January 5 next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said around 80 percent of passengers will pay no more than 50 cents extra per trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although passenger volume and the revenues of franchised buses have significantly recovered after the pandemic, they have not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels due to changes in consumption and travel habits," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added the fare hikes would help bus companies stay afloat, and that factors such as operating costs and public affordability had been considered.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus had asked for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wanted to put fares up by 9.5 percent for most routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the fare hike approval, Citybus said this was the fourth approved fare adjustment application in the past 15 years, adding it would continue to improve efficiency and cut operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to develop and expand our revenues next year, growing the network across Hong Kong organically and riding on the success and growth of our newly launched 'HK City Sightseeing' tourism brand," Citybus wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB said it would do its best to give fare discounts to passengers, including interchange discounts between different routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The operator said it would continue to expand its non-farebox revenues, such as setting up convenience stores at bus stations and providing services to commercial vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said the fare increases strike a balance between the impact on people's livelihoods and the financial sustainability of bus companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the approval, Lee said the government has exercised its gatekeeping role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding KMB and Citybus' franchises for urban and New Territories routes, we approved smaller fare increases than what the companies requested," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For routes that regular commuters use every day, we'll keep the increases lower. For routes mainly used by tourists on holidays and leisure trips, we'll apply higher increases. This way, we can minimise the impact on daily commuters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Cheung, chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee (TAC), welcomed the fare hike approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The TAC agrees that the government has endeavoured to strike a balance between minimising the impact on people's livelihood and maintaining reasonable financial capability of franchised bus operators for continuous investments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung added the government should continue to help bus operators reduce costs and expand sources of revenue to ease the pressure of fare increases.

 An explosive device planted close to a residential apartment block in Moscow killed the head of Russia’s Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defence Forces, Lt. General Igor Kirillov, early on Tuesday, Russia’s Investigative Committee said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov’s assistant also died in the blast, triggered by the device which was placed in a scooter, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian investigators have opened a case into the two deaths, according to the committee's spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Investigators, forensic experts and operational services are working at the scene,” she said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Investigative and search activities are being carried out to establish all the circumstances around this crime.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Kirillov, who had been in his post since 2017, was sanctioned in October by Britain over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. (Agencies)

 An earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck Vanuatu's capital Port Vila on Tuesday, damaging buildings and cars with at least one person reported killed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vanuatu state broadcaster VBTC showed footage of vehicles crushed in a building collapse on a street lined with retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broadcaster reported one person had been trapped in a collapsed building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said at least one person had been killed and injured people had been taken to hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The road connecting Port Vila to the international shipping terminal was blocked by landslides, officials added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other footage posted on social media showed buckled windows and collapsed concrete pillars on a building hosting foreign missions in the capital, including the US, British, French and New Zealand embassies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Papua New Guinea said its embassy in Port Vila had sustained "considerable damage" and was closed until further notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand's High Commission building, which is co-located with the US, French and British missions, had "sustained significant damage," a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were communications outages across the country, the New Zealand statement added, while the Australian High Commission in Vanuatu said its communication systems had also been affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake occurred at a depth of 57 kilometres and was centered 30 kilometres west of Port Vila, the largest city in the Pacific island nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half a dozen aftershocks hit Vanuatu following the initial quake, USGS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was one that had us all sort of perched and ready to move again. But none of them have been anywhere near as bad as the initial shock," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning System cancelled an initial tsunami warning for Vanuatu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the US, Australia and New Zealand said there was no tsunami threat to their territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Australia was closely monitoring the situation following the "devastating earthquake". (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday he hopes the incoming Trump administration would "make the right choice" and work with Beijing, hours after Donald Trump told reporters the Covid-19 pandemic had strained his relationship with "friend" President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the new US administration will make the right choice and work with China in a mutually-beneficial manner to remove disruptions and overcome obstacles," the foreign minister told a forum in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the two countries can achieve "many great things" if they work together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also warned against "crude interference" by the US on the issue of Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a very good relationship until Covid," Trump told reporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday when asked whether Xi would attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Covid didn't end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government will seriously consider all opinions on the next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a public consultation under way on Sunday, Lee said Financial Secretary Paul Chan will give serious consideration to all the advice proposed for the upcoming budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of advice and opinions have already been provided," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary has been doing this budget consultation for a number of years, and he will of course be taking serious attention to all the opinions and suggestions that are raised, examine the pros and cons, and also the reasoning and the thinking behind, so as to ensure that the eventual budget will satisfy the overall needs of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sure that the financial secretary will be paying heed to different opinions and analyse all the opinions very objectively and thoroughly to ensure that the best budget is prepared for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told businesses to grasp opportunities, thanks to stronger visitor numbers and an increase in online shopping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, we have a budget deficit, but already we have said that we will try to increase income, and also to reduce expenditure as well and to promote economic growth so the businesses will make more money, as a result of which the government will also have more income," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government will seek to make around HK$90 billion in investments each year, and he believes private investments will improve following a number of policies and measures launched by the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the budget deficit for the current fiscal year could double to around HK$100 billion from an earlier estimate.

    Police warn Carousell users of bogus payment websites

<img alt="From left to right: senior inspector Victoria Ng, chief inspector Felton Leung and Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783810_1_20241217114145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are urging users of the popular online trading platform Carousell to be vigilant against bogus payment links aimed at hacking into their bank accounts, with 644 cases recorded in the first 10 months of the year, incurring losses of HK$36 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tactic emerged as the force noted a 23.7 percent year-on-year rise in the overall number of online shopping scams during the same period, and the amount involved more than doubled to HK$332 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make transactions safer, Carousell introduced a Buyer Protection service in August, through which the seller only receives payment after the buyer confirms receipt of the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  But senior inspector Victoria Ng of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said the number of scams surged after the service was rolled out, with 330 cases recorded alone between August and October, involving HK$25 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained scammers would pose as buyers and offer to pay for the item through the new payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers, after providing an e-mail address, would then receive a phishing link, which directs them to a website asking for details of their online banking account.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers could then withdraw all the money from the victims’ accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin clarified users never have to surrender their e-mail address when using the payment system, let alone click on links.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In today's day and age, it's really a very risky behaviour to click on any links that you receive, whether it's via e-mail, or through your WhatsApp,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But not just sellers are being scammed - chief inspector Felton Leung noted buyers seeking sought-after items, such as concert tickets, can also fall prey to deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The scammers … play mind games with the victims. They knew that the victims want [the product] so much and it's so hard to get in any other places, so they will put on some time frame or time constraint on the victims. If they don't settle the deal as soon as possible, they will not get the tickets.' he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police advised buyers to stick to official or reputable sellers, and ask to trade in person whenever possible.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong is ready for an influx of tourists on New Year's Eve, with special border crossing and transport arrangements in place.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the government will ensure visitors have a smooth journey home after enjoying the 12-minute fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 31, most MTR lines will run overnight, and the Shenzhen Bay port will operate around the clock. The Lo Wu checkpoint will be open until 2am, instead of closing at the usual time of midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the government, we will ensure that the whole arrangement for tourists to come to Hong Kong will be orderly, safe, and also it will be a pleasant experience, particularly when they go through the boundary control points," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that Hong Kong has seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in tourists from Shenzhen during weekends since the resumption of unlimited entry visas, and the trend is likely to continue through Christmas and New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the increase in the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong from different parts of the world, in particular those from Shenzhen, we have to ensure that first of all we will treat them nicely so that they all have a good experience and will think of coming back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said he will travel to Macau to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new term of the SAR government and congratulate Macau CE-elect Sam Hou-fai on taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping will also be in Macau from Wednesday to Friday to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's return to the nation.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced a relaxation of its visa-free transit policy, extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers to 240 hours, or 10 days, from 72 to 144 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as the country tries to attract more visitors, boosting post-pandemic travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective immediately, 21 additional ports have been designated for visa-free entry and exit, and the areas in which transit travellers can stay have been expanded, according to a statement from National Immigration Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the updated policy, eligible citizens from 54 countries, including Russia, Brazil, Britain, the United States and Canada, can enter China visa-free when transiting to a third country or region.
  <br>
  <br>
  These travellers may now enter through any of the 60 ports across 24 provinces, regions and municipalities, and stay within the designated areas for up to 240 hours. Cross-regional travel is being introduced, allowing foreign visitors to move freely across the 24 specified provincial-level regions during their 10-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  China recorded nearly 29.22 million inbound foreign visits in the first 11 months of 2024, up 86.2 percent year on year. Of these, 17.45 million entered the country visa-free, more than doubling the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since reopening its borders in 2023, Beijing has waived visa requirements for travellers to encourage visitation to the world's second largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the Foreign Ministry said China had extended its visa-free policy to a total of 38 countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 The Hong Kong stock market opened lower on Tuesday, with some investors apparently nervous ahead of a rate review in the United States.

    US players to be paid for competing at 2025 Ryder Cup

<img alt="Each member of Team USA is set to receive a US$200,000 stipend. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783776_1_20241217074639.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfers will be paid to play in the Ryder Cup for the first time after the PGA of America unveiled a program on Monday that will give each team member a US$200,000 stipend and US$300,000 to distribute to charity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The program will take effect with the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America said in a statement that its board of directors had voted on the move, which increases the US$200,000 that has been given to each player to distribute to the charities of his choice since the 1999 edition of the biennial match play showdown with Europe was held at Brookline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America added that no players had asked to be compensated, but the issue of pay for play in the prestigious event has reportedly been a source of tension within the US team in previous editions.
  <br>
  <br>
  USA Today newspaper cited a letter to past Ryder Cup captains from PGA of American president Don Rea, who said the stipend was added "out of respect for the players" and would be separate from what players receive for expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's recognition for all the players have done for the Ryder Cup over the years," Rea wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  When reports of compensation for US players surfaced last month, longtime European Ryder Cup stars Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy said they did not need financial incentives to give their all in the often emotional competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for us, we play for the badge and we also play for the European Tour," Rose said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Bethpage Black next year Europe will be defending the title they won in Italy in 2023, but they will be chasing their first victory in the event on US soil since the famous "Miracle at Medinah" in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players on the European Ryder Cup Team do not get paid for participating in the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament is scheduled for September 26 to 28, when the Americans will try to reclaim the trophy from Europe. (AFP/Reuters)

    Unal last-gasp denies West Ham at Bournemouth

<img alt="Bournemouth midfielder Enes Unal celebrates after scoring to draw level. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783775_1_20241217073802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bournemouth's Enes Unal provided a dramatic climax to his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday as the Turkey forward's superb late free-kick cancelled out Lucas Paquetá's penalty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paquetá looked to have sealed West Ham's second successive Premier League victory when he converted from the spot with just three minutes left at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unal came to the Cherries' rescue three minutes later with only his second goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old's moment of magic extended Bournemouth's unbeaten run to four games as they climbed to sixth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enes scored an amazing goal – he's a specialist. But it's only one point. I'm very disappointed with the penalty," Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said of the decision that went against his team for Tyler Adams' handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a play we analysed at a meeting before the season," he added. "The refereeing chiefs said players don't need to defend with hands behind their back in an unnatural position. It didn't affect the direction of the cross – I don't care about the explanation now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth have scored a league-high 10 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of those goals came in a remarkable 2-1 win at Ipswich in their previous game, with Unal also scoring Bournemouth's equaliser on that occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham have gone two games without defeat to ease a little of the pressure on boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suffered a little bit and overcame this to score, but it was an incredible goal from Unal. It's a pity," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are positives," he added. "This is the first step to be strong and a better team."
  <br>
  <br>
  They remain in 14th place and sit seven points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European champions England will renew their rivalry with France and the Netherlands, and also clash with debutants Wales in the group stage of the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament after the draw was made in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br>
  World Cup winners Spain, second in the Fifa rankings and hungry to claim a first Euro title, should have an easier path against Group B opponents Portugal, Belgium and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight-times European champions Germany, who are ranked third in the world, are in Group C with Poland, Denmark and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hosts Switzerland will play Norway, Iceland and Finland in Group A and will kick off the tournament on July 2 against the Norwegians in Basel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being holders, Sarina Wiegman's England team were placed in Pot 2 of the draw after finishing second behind France by a point in their Euro qualifying group, with the two teams splitting their qualifying games with identical 2-1 scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  England face France in their group opener on July 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding more drama to what should be a blockbuster group stage, familiar foes the Netherlands – Wiegman's home country and former team – kept the Lionesses out of the Paris Olympics by finishing ahead of them in the Nations League. The two teams will meet on July 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiegman is the only manager to have won the women's Euros with two different countries, having also lifted the trophy with the Dutch in 2017. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq surged to a fresh record Monday at the start of a heavy week of economic news that includes a US Federal Reserve rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  Large gains by chip company Broadcom, Google parent Alphabet and some other tech names helped lift the index 1.2 percent to 20,173.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 43,717, while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 6,074.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments pointed to SoftBank's announcement that it would invest US$100 billion in the United States as being supportive of tech shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's renewed optimism in semiconductor and big tech stocks," Sarhan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said the market may take a breather until it receives key data points later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot to digest this week," Ablin said of a calendar that includes key retail sales and inflation data, as well as a Fed monetary policy decision. (AFP)

    TikTok turns to US Supreme Court to avert ban

<img alt="Tiktok faces January 19 deadline for its parent to sell the social media platform. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783758_1_20241217045330.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's January 19 deadline. A similar plea was expected from content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the US and significant advertising revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect January 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences because President-elect Donald Trump pledged during the campaign that he would “save TikTok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that they can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, the justices could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April. (AP)
