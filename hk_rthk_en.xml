<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean police on Thursday raided the offices of Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of the probe into the fatal crash of a Boeing 737-800 plane that killed 179 people.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flight was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before slamming into a barrier, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities carried out search and seizure operations at the Muan airport where flight 2216 crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing the crash site since the disaster to establish a cause, with both black boxes found and decoding work ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In relation to the plane accident... a search and seizure operation is being conducted…at three locations," police said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The police plan to swiftly and rigorously determine the cause and responsibility for this accident in accordance with the law and principles."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported a search warrant was approved on charges of professional negligence resulting in death, citing officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea has also announced it will inspect all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by its carriers, focusing on the landing gear, which appears to have malfunctioned during the Sunday crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, said on Thursday that "immediate action" must be taken if that probe uncovered any issues with the aircraft model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have previously said 101 aircraft of the same model were in operation by six different airlines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant agencies must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If any issues are found during the inspection, please take immediate corrective action," he added. (AFP)

    Cage homes won't be under new regulations: Winnie Ho

<img alt="Winnie Ho said officials would implement new regulations over future basic housing units with care. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785862_1_20250102132347.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho on Thursday said the government was not including cage homes and cubicle units under the planned new regulatory regime for subdivided flats, because those are already subject to an existing licensing system.
 <br>
  <br>
  There have been calls for the government to put these so-called bed space units under the future basic housing unit regime, which would subject flats to requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the housing chief said there's a public misconception about this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Bed space' units in various forms – including 'cage homes', 'coffin homes' and 'space capsule' units – are already regulated by the licensing regime under the Bedspace Apartments Ordinance," Ho wrote in an SCMP opinion piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regulation under the regime for basic housing units would only duplicate regulations and is therefore unnecessary."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho said the government estimates that around 80,000 basic housing units would still be available in the market after the new laws are introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coupled with the fact that more public housing will be available in the coming years, she said there shouldn't be much room for rents to rise significantly for subdivided flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that as tackling subdivided flats is her bureau's top priority, the government is striving to pass legal changes by the end of the year and would then implement new regulations in a gradual and careful manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Landlords would be given up to a year and a half to register the flats, followed by a grace period of up to two years for working things out with tenants before flat conversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said after the completion of registration, officials would decide on the time frame for law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said enforcement would be carried out in an orderly manner, to avoid displacing affected households.

    HK breast milk bank to commence operations on Jan 6

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank – located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay – will start services on January 6, the Hospital Authority said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Thursday, the facility's director Rosanna Wong said the bank aims to collect 50 to 100 litres of breast milk in its first stage of service, so it can start supplying the milk to premature or critically-ill newborns in nine public hospitals in March – when the second stage launched.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will ensure the quality of the breast milk. We will conduct checks including screening, microbiological testing, pasteurisation, and nutritional analysis, all under precise temperature control. The processed breast milk will then be eligible to supply to the newborns,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said breast milk is easier for premature newborns to digest, and can reduce the chance of them developing complications due to their early birth.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the bank could collect around 1,000 litres of breast milk a year in future, benefiting 450 to 600 newborns.
  <br>
  <br>
  To donate breast milk, Wong said the donor must be healthy, must not smoke nor drink alcohol, and is currently breastfeeding a baby under one year old.
  <br>
  <br>
  The donor will also have to take a blood test once every three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the facility will provide milk bottles and pouches to the donors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donors can store their breast milk in a refrigerator at home before a courier arranged by the facility collects the milk.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who has been charged with murder and attempted robbery, in connection with an incident in Sham Shui Po more than three decades ago, appeared in Eastern Court on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wen Wenye, 59, was arrested last November when he entered Hong Kong via the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is alleged to be one of three people who robbed a second-hand watch store on Pei Ho Street before fleeing in a car in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 56-year-old male shopkeeper died after being shot in the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Magistrates’ Court has adjourned the case pending transfer to the High Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defendant was again remanded in custody.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are still searching for the two other suspects.

    Calls for more support for single households

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts have called for more support measures to cope with the rising trend of single-person households in Hong Kong, with reviews on existing policies to better cater for their needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of one-person households in the SAR rose from around 13 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Lou, professor of social work and social administration at the University of Hong Kong, said society had generally become more accepting towards those living alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of our policies, programmes, and economic activities are not biased towards multi-persons families. If you are single, you can still enjoy, participate and contribute," she said on the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For part of the policies or care systems, we do need to critically review and identify the blocks; what blocks the one-person households from enjoying, asserting their choices, and participating wholly in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  Srinivas Tata, the social development division director of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said single-person households mostly consisted of two groups of people – young people and elderly individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said support was needed to prevent singletons, in particular those from the older generation, suffering from emotional distress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes the prescriptions are social prescriptions. It means more interactions, it means more emotional support, it means having the opportunity to interact with people," Tata said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Promoting intergenerational interactions and government policies for children to support parents are key to strengthening support for those living alone, Tata added.

    Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine ends

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)

 At least one person was killed and seven wounded when a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside a hotel belonging to US President-elect Donald Trump in Las Vegas, police said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electric vehicle pulled up to the Trump International Hotel's glass entrance before a "large explosion," Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage shows the stainless steel truck parked at the hotel entrance before bursting into flames, followed by smaller explosions that appeared similar to fireworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahill said there was "one deceased individual inside the Cybertruck" while seven people received "minor" injuries. He said the hotel had been evacuated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Joe Biden said authorities were investigating any possible link between the blast and an attack earlier Wednesday in New Orleans, in which a truck rammed a crowd, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thus far, there's nothing to report on that score," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla chief Elon Musk said the explosion was "caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck," adding in a post on X that it was "unrelated to the vehicle itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, he said the "whole Tesla senior team" was investigating the blast, adding: "We've never seen anything like this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, who backed Trump in the November election and was named by the Republican to head up a commission to trim government spending, said he would post more information "as soon as we learn anything." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elena Rybakina's Kazakhstan dumped defending champions Germany out of the United Cup with Alexander Zverev sidelined by an arm injury barely a week away from the Australian Open, while top seeds USA beat China to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Sydney, women's world number two Iga Swiatek led Poland into the last eight by winning a rematch of her 2023 French Open final against the Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain also progressed to the quarter-finals with Katie Boulter's dominant 6-2, 6-1 victory over Australia's Olivia Gadecki enough to guarantee they won their group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upset in Perth sent the Kazakhs into the semi-finals of the 18-nation tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixth-ranked Rybakina earned the first point for Kazakhstan, with the 2022 Wimbledon champion hammering Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev then withdrew from his clash against Alexander Shevchenko at the last minute with a bicep strain, leaving the 254th-ranked Daniel Masur to face him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He put up a brave fight but Shevchenko was too strong, powering home 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-2 despite a medical timeout in the second set, complaining about difficulty breathing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling in this heat, it was so rough," said the world number 78, who upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in group play on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a headache and my head was spinning, but I wanted to win this one." added Shevchenko. "After [losing] the first set, I knew I had to shorten the rallies and play aggressively."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other quarter-final, 2023 winners United States beat China thanks to singles rubber wins by Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Gauff beat Zhang Shuai 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, and Fritz then put the tie beyond the Chinese with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Zhang Zhizhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coco did such a good job putting us ahead and giving me the chance to come out and put us through," said Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a little bit of pressure because I didn't want to be the one who loses it for the team after Coco won all her matches this week," he added. "I played a really solid match – really happy with it." (AFP)

    New Orleans attack suspect was US-born army veteran

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans attack suspect, identified by the FBI as 42-year-old US citizen Shamsud-Din Jabbar, appeared to be a real estate agent from Texas who had spent 10 years as an IT specialist in his country's army.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a video posted on YouTube four years ago, Jabbar – speaking with a southern US accent – boasted of his skills as a "fierce negotiator" as he advertised his property management services to potential clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  Criminal records reported by the New York Times show that Jabbar had two previous charges for minor offences – one in 2002 for theft and another in 2005 for driving with an invalid licence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar was twice-married, according to the newspaper, with his second marriage ending in divorce in 2022, when he detailed experiencing financial problems in an email to his wife's lawyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cannot afford the house payment," he reportedly wrote, adding that his real estate company had lost more than US$28,000 in the previous year, and that he had taken on thousands in credit card debt to pay for lawyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper reported that Jabbar had gotten a degree from Georgia State University.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabbar said in his YouTube video that he served in the US military for a decade as a human resources specialist and an IT specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that with this experience, he "learned the meaning of great service and what it means to be responsive and take everything seriously, dotting I's and crossing T's to make sure that things go off without a hitch."
  <br>
  <br>
  The FBI confirmed at a news conference that Jabbar was a US army veteran but did not detail his role. The agency said it was believed that he had been honourably discharged, but that its probe was ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 15 people were killed and more than 30 wounded when Jabbar allegedly drove a truck at high speed into a crowd of New Year's revellers in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said he crashed the vehicle, then opened fire and was killed in a shootout with police. (AFP)

    Arsenal close gap on Liverpool with win over Brentford

<img alt="Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus celebrates after scoring his team first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785803_1_20250102053400.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal closed the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool to six points as Gabriel Jesus extended his hot-streak in a 3-1 win at Brentford on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Bryan Mbeumo's first-half goal at the Gtech Community Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal refused to be blown away on a wet and windy evening in west London as Jesus equalised before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian's sixth goal in his last four games after he scored just once in his first 20 matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli netted in quick succession soon after half-time to ensure Arsenal moved into second place above Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We won in a difficult stadium against a good opponent. The record they have here is incredible and when you go 1-0 down it makes it even harder," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially when you go a goal down early in the game it becomes a mountain to climb, but we remained patient," he added. "We had to manage the situation emotionally. We were very clinical in the box. Jesus's form is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding their 5-1 rout of Crystal Palace, the Gunners had spluttered through their last four league games with lacklustre draws against Fulham and Everton followed by a narrow win over lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's first Premier League game of 2025 provided compelling evidence that they are ready to compete in the title race with Liverpool, who have a game in hand on the north Londoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Runners-up to Manchester City for the last two seasons, Arsenal are unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, a revitalising run that now includes four successive wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can only win our next match and see what happens. It's not in our hands," Arteta said of chasing Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka sidelined for several months due to a hamstring injury, 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri made his first league start for Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz was absent after scoring Arsenal's winner against Ipswich, but Jesus ensured the German was not missed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal did not lose a single one of their 10 league London derbies in 2024 and they maintained their impressive record in capital clashes after surviving an early blow. (AFP)

 Ten people were killed and 30 injured when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Year's Day, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  New Orleans police earlier said they were responding to a mass casualty incident, including fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident came toward the end of New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the AllState Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Caesars Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau on Sunday said casino revenues rose by almost a quarter in 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau showed gaming revenue last year coming in at 227 billion patacas, 23.9 percent higher than it 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  That topped the government's estimate of 216 billion patacas, but trailed the 292.5 billion logged prior to the pandemic in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, is now looking to diversify its economy through new industries and increased integration with the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its economy is heavily reliant on casinos, which contribute about 80 percent of tax revenues. (additional reporting by Reuters)

    Hong Kong brings back 3pc hotel accommodation tax

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Wednesday brought back the three percent accommodation tax which had been suspended since July 2008.
 <br>
  <br>
  While some tourists called the tax rate acceptable, others were unhappy that the extra charge wasn't clearly stipulated on booking websites.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a hotel in Wan Chai, a mainland tourist who's checking in said he finds the tax rate acceptable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's fine, I respect your system here. The platform shows the tax added to the price and reminds you. For overseas consumption, we always pay tax in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another tourist told RTHK that the tax wasn't clearly indicated on some online booking platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the platforms should show the tax amount in brackets, or show the prices with and without tax, then consumers would know," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the key is to make the tax collection process as straightforward as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government hasn't specified how to collect it. Some hotels want to save costs, so they collect at the front desk. We need to decide whether to make it more complex by collecting at the front desk or collect it all through online travel agents," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chui also hopes the government will consider lowering the tax rate when public finances improve.

    Syria working towards a free press, says minister

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Syria's minister of information in the country's transitional government told AFP he is working towards a free press and committed to "freedom of expression", after decades of tight control under the country's former rulers.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to consolidate freedoms of the press and expression that were severely restricted" in areas controlled by the former government of Bashar al-Assad, said the minister, Mohamed al-Omar, after Islamist-led rebels on December 8 ended more than five decades of rule by the Assad clan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Syria's ruling Baath party and the Assad family dynasty heavily curtailed all aspects of daily life, including freedom of the press and expression with the media a tool of those in power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reporters Without Borders, a freedom of information watchdog, ranked Syria second-last on its 2024 World Press Freedom Index, ahead only of Eritrea and behind Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a heavy restriction on freedom of the press and expression under the regime which practised censorship. In the period to come we are working on the reconstruction of a media landscape that is free, objective and professional," Omar said during an interview with AFP on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is part of the interim administration installed in Damascus by the victorious rebel coalition led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group has its origins in the Syrian branch of the jihadist group Al-Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organisation by numerous governments, but has sought to soften its image in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats from around the region and from the West have made contact with Syria's new rulers, who have also vowed to protect the country's religious and ethnic minorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Omar was previously minister of information in the self-proclaimed Salvation Government, the civil administration set up in 2017 by HTS in the rebel holdout of Idlib province, in Syria's northwest. It was from Idlib that the rebels began their lightning advance towards Damascus, 13 years into the country's civil war.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the conflict erupted in 2011 with the government's brutal repression of pro-democracy protests, Assad tightened restrictions on independent journalism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want to continue in the same way, that is, have an official media whose aim is to polish the image of the ruling power," Omar said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following Assad's overthrow and flight to Moscow, Syrian media outlets which had trumpeted his regime's glories quickly adopted a revolutionary fervour.

    Investigators vow to execute warrant for Yoon

<img alt="A supporter of impeached South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol holds up a placard. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785766_1_20250101162556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators said on Wednesday they would execute an arrest warrant for Yoon Suk Yeol over his declaration of martial law by the deadline of January 6, as the impeached leader's supporters rallied outside his residence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Supporters and opponents of Yoon, who was suspended from office by lawmakers over his attempt to subvert civilian rule last month, have been camped outside the compound where he has been holed up for weeks, fending off investigators' efforts to question him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) requested the warrant after Yoon failed to report for questioning a third time, but it has been unclear whether they could execute it as the Presidential Security Service has previously refused to comply with search warrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  CIO chief Oh Dong-woon said on Wednesday the warrant would be executed "within the deadline", which is on Monday, January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aim for a smooth process without major disturbances, but we are also coordinating to mobilise police and personnel in preparation," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon could themselves face prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We consider actions such as setting up various barricades and locking iron gates to resist the execution of our arrest warrant as obstruction of official duties," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyone doing this "could be prosecuted under charges of abuse of authority interfering with the exercise of rights and obstruction of official duties by special means", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's legal team have filed for an injunction to block the warrant and claimed on Wednesday the arrest order was "an unlawful and invalid act", lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president's die-hard supporters raced to Seoul to support him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the presidential compound dozens of people -- some in elaborate costume -- could be seen chanting, singing and hurling vitriol at police.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, some attempted to break through a cordon and block a police bus from parking near the entrance -- apparently mistaking it for the mobile force that may be dispatched to detain Yoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were sent to the area in large numbers and could be seen yelling at protesters to keep in line, but a route in and out of Yoon's residence remained clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean officials have previously failed to execute arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police from entering for the seven-day period the warrant was valid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has been stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the majority of Yoon's remaining staff, including his chief of staff and special advisors, all tendered their resignations to the country's acting president -- who rejected them, calling instead for unity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a time for everyone to come together for the stability of the livelihood of the people and national affairs," acting president Choi Sang-mok said
  <br>
  <br>
  The resignations were a show of discontent over Choi's decision to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court hearing Yoon's impeachment -- meeting a key demand of the opposition, but branded an overstepping of the powers of the acting leader by Yoon's staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspended president declared martial law in a televised address, saying it was aimed at eliminating "anti-state elements" but lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, heavily armed troops stormed the building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turmoil deepened late last week when Yoon's replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi took office on Friday and found himself thrust immediately into a disaster with the Jeju Air plane crash on Sunday that claimed 179 lives. (AFP)

    'Arrangements at border control points were smooth'

<img alt="The Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, operated until 2am on Wednesday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785753_1_20250101125820.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said arrangements at border control points were smooth, as travellers returned to the mainland in the early hours of January 1 following countdown celebrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Bay Control Point operated overnight; and the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually closes at midnight, extended its service hours to 2am. The operation of the East Rail line was also extended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said 400,000 people watched the fireworks display over Victoria Harbour. It added that between midnight and 6:30am, around 25,000 mainland visitors departed Hong Kong via land boundary control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the tourists RTHK spoke to said they were satisfied with the transport arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike last year when many visitors were left stranded after trains stopped running, one said everything was a lot smoother this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were stuck here last year... for four to five hours. We also celebrated the New Year [in Hong Kong] last year. It's more convenient this year," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another traveller said thanks to the extension of service hours on the East Rail line and the Lo Wu Control Point, he could return to the mainland easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If not, I would have to go to Mong Kok to take the overnight bus, so I saved about an hour," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security chief Chris Tang, who earlier inspected the Lo Wu crossing, said he was pleased that visitors were able to cross the border smoothly and quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether MTR lines and control points can further extend their service hours in future, he said the authorities have to consider different factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's impossible for all border control points to operate overnight. We have to look at the necessity, and how we utilise our resources," Tang said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The inaugural flights of the domestically-produced C919 aircraft between Shanghai and Hong Kong have opened a "new chapter" for the SAR as an international aviation hub, transport and logistics chief Mable Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first flight that took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport arrived in the SAR shortly before 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, Chan said she feels honoured to witness the historic moment on New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the first city beyond the other mainland cities to have this kind of commercial flight. So we are especially happy to see this flight materialise on the first day of 2025," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that through this commercial flight, we can bring this historical innovation breakthrough in the mainland's production of civil aviation aircraft to our Hong Kong citizens, as well as to the international visitors coming to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR has what it takes to shine as an aviation engineering hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong International Airport has rich experience and comprehensive facilities to fully support the maintenance of domestically produced aircraft in Hong Kong and overseas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Secondly, the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy is an important aviation talent training base in the Asia region. The academy is planning to expand training to cover C919 aircraft, which will help domestically-produced planes enter overseas markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport chief also said the government is looking to further develop the aircraft leasing market by rolling out various tax incentives, to help homegrown aircraft go global.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A domestically-produced C919 aircraft has completed its first commercial flight to Hong Kong amid much fanfare.
 <br>
  <br>
  The homegrown passenger jet, operated by China Eastern airlines and carrying around 160 passengers, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 8.15am on Wednesday and landed in the SAR about two and a half hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers were treated to an exceptional travel experience, with each of them receiving a special framed boarding pass – printed with the flight number, date, as well as the letters “C919” - as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those on-board the full flight was Ryan, who flew on the C919 aircraft for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m also a citizen of Hong Kong. It feels really special. Shanghai is my hometown and Hong Kong is like my second hometown. It’s really special to be able to experience the Chinese manufactured C919 on this flight,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan described the flight experience as being “impressively good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am quite fortunate to get the bulkhead seat. It has plenty of leg room which is nice on a narrow-body jet. Looking back, the leg room is also big [for other seats] and the tray table is pretty nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  13-year-old Joe, a flying enthusiast, flew solo.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the control of noise is very nice. Because it’s the first aircraft of China and in some ways it’s even better than Boeing and Airbus. The seats… are really comfortable,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meal was really good... We had this sort of Shanghai cake and another cake that had C919 letters on it and it was very delicious.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other passengers like Gin and his son Harrison, who just happened to be on this maiden flight, said they were impressed with the flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it would be very loud but the noise wasn’t big at all. The seats were quite spacious,” six-year-old Harrison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the captain of the inaugural flight, Shang Feng, told RTHK that he's honoured and excited to take passengers to Hong Kong on board the C919.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is our ninth destination with C919. Over the last two years, C919 has been flying to major airports in mainland cities and it fully showcases its ability to adapt and operate smoothly in different locations. I believe future regular flights to Hong Kong will be smooth,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern said it will be using the C919 jet for one round-trip flight between Shanghai and Hong Kong per day, with the return trip scheduled for departure at 12.55pm.

<img alt="Sunday's Jeju Air crash at Muan International Airport was the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785745_1_20250101115248.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Investigators probing a Jeju Air crash which killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil have extracted the initial data from one of the Boeing 737-800's black boxes, an official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it issued a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting a barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean and US investigators, including from Boeing, have been combing over the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of the plane's black boxes were retrieved, and for the cockpit voice recorder, "the initial extraction has already been completed," said deputy minister for civil aviation Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on this preliminary data, we plan to start converting it into audio format," he said, meaning investigators would be able to hear the pilots' final communications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second black box, the flight data recorder, "was found with a missing connector," Joo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts are currently conducting a final review to determine how to extract data from it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause of the disaster, but they have since said the probe was also examining a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which dramatic video showed the Boeing 737-800 colliding with before bursting into flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have also been questions over possible mechanical failures, with local media reporting that the landing gear had deployed properly on Jeju Air Flight 2216's first failed landing attempt at Muan airport before failing on the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The issue "will likely be examined by the Accident Investigation Board through a comprehensive review of various testimonies and evidence during the investigation process," the ministry of land, which oversees civil aviation, said at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Muan airport, grieving families of victims had become increasingly frustrated by delays in identifying and releasing the bodies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have said the bodies were extensively damaged by the crash, making the work of identifying remains slow and immensely difficult, even as investigators had to preserve crash-site evidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the country's acting president said on Wednesday the process had finally been completed, and that more bodies had been handed over to relatives so that they could hold funerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overnight, the identification of all 179 victims was completed," said acting president Choi Sang-mok, who has been in office less than a week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our investigators, along with the US National Transportation Safety Board and the manufacturer, are conducting a joint investigation into the cause of the accident," Choi said at a disaster response meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A comprehensive analysis and review of the aircraft's structure and the black box data will reveal the cause of the accident," Choi added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US investigators had arrived on Monday and headed straight to Muan, with the initial on-site joint probe focusing on a navigation system that assists in aircraft landings, known as a localiser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The localiser, installed on a concrete structure at Muan International Airport, is the barrier that has been blamed for exacerbating the severity of the Jeju Air crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was largely carrying holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, with all passengers Korean nationals except for two Thais.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fuller account of what went wrong in the flight's final moments is expected once authorities have analysed the black boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Memorial altars for the victims have been set up nationwide, including in Seoul and at Muan airport. (AFP)

<img alt="Chief Executive John Lee says on a video posted on social media that many good things happened to Hong Kong in 2024." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785741_1_20250101111607.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government will focus on reforming and improving people's livelihoods in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his New Year message through a video, Lee described 2024 as a historical year for Hong Kong, with many good things happening, including the completion of the national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted new momentum for the economy, such as the two giant pandas gifted by the central authorities, the resumption of multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, and the commencement of the three-runway system at the Hong Kong International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that his administration also worked on building more flats, came up with a plan to eradicate substandard subdivided units, and set up community living rooms to cater for the needs of the grassroots community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the CE said his government has several main goals this year -- reform and embrace changes, strengthen the SAR's connectivity with the mainland and the world; as well as improve people's livelihoods and foster harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Facing drastic changes both in the external and internal environments, Hong Kong must understand, respond to and embrace them, while taking the initiative to align with national development strategies," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we will strengthen our exchanges and cooperation with the world, open up to new markets, strengthen regional cooperation, and continue to boost our international influence."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Co-operation Zone will start operating this year, marking a milestone for the SAR as an international I&T centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that 9,500 light public housing units and three more community living rooms will be made available this year, while Hong Kong's first Chinese medicine hospital will commence operation in phases this year.

 Three men died after a taxi collided with a private car in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shortly before 2 am, both cars were travelling along the West Kowloon Highway towards the Western Harbour Crossing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Near Olympic MTR Station the taxi reportedly swerved into the other vehicle's lane and hit it, causing it to go out of control, ram a concrete divider, and smash into a moving taxi and three stationary vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The car driver was certified dead at the scene, while two of his four male passengers were certified dead at Princess Margaret Hospital about an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two other car passengers, along with the two in the taxi, were sent to hospital for treatment for a variety of injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The taxi driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 From Sydney to Mumbai to Nairobi, communities around the world began welcoming 2025 with spectacular light shows, embraces and ice plunges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Auckland became the first major city to celebrate, as thousands thronged downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point. A light display recognised Indigenous people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean were the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conflict muted acknowledgements of the start of 2025 in places like the Middle East, Sudan and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks blasted off the Sydney Harbour Bridge and across the bay. More than a million Australians and others gathered at the iconic Sydney Harbour for the celebration. British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The celebration also featured Indigenous ceremonies and performances that acknowledged the land’s first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Japan shut down ahead of the nation’s biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upcoming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth – alluding to the reptile’s shedding skin. Other places in Asia will mark the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or cancelled during a period of national mourning following Sunday's crash of a Jeju Air flight in Muan that killed 179 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Thailand's Bangkok, shopping malls competed for crowds with live musical acts and fireworks shows. A fireworks display in Indonesia's Jakarta featured 800 drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year’s greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of the growing closeness between the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Putin their countries will “always move forward hand in hand,” the official Xinhua News Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In India, thousands of revellers in the financial hub of Mumbai flocked to the city's bustling promenade facing the Arabian Sea. In Sri Lanka, people gathered at Buddhist temples to light oil lamps and incense sticks and pray.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Dubai, thousands attended a fireworks show at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. And in Nairobi, Kenya, scattered fireworks were heard as midnight approached.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rome’s traditional New Year’s Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis’ Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter’s Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to again appeal for peace in Ukraine and the Middle East.
  <br>
  <br>
  January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris capped a momentous 2024 with its traditional countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the Champs-Elysées. The city’s emblematic Arc de Triomphe monument was turned into a giant tableau for a light show that celebrated the city's landmarks and the passage of time, with whirring clocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Paris is a party,” proclaimed Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September had transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank and Rowena Klar from San Francisco visited the French capital to celebrate 31 years together. “If you start it big, we think we’re going to have a great year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rang in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland, were cancelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Switzerland and some other places, people embraced the cold, stripping and plunging into the water in freezing temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil’s main New Year’s Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with ferries offshore launching 12 straight minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists on cruise ships will witness the show up close.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 2 million people were expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze into concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York City, the organisation managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year’s celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora and Sophie Ellis-Bextor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Las Vegas' pyrotechnic show will be on the Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of casinos. Nearby, the Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pasadena, California, Rose Parade spectators were camping out and hoping for prime spots. And some 200,000 people were flocking to a country music party in Nashville, Tennessee.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Samoa will be among the last to welcome 2025, a full 24 hours after New Zealand. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce led all players in fan voting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelce, whose romance with Taylor Swift brought the NFL to the attention of the pop megastar's legion of fans, finished with 252,200 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs was second overall with 250,082 votes and Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has helped the Commanders into the playoffs, was third with 242,352.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions led all clubs in total votes received, followed by the Minnesota Vikings, Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selections for the Pro Bowl Games rosters for the AFC and NFC are determined by a combination of voting by fans, players and coaches, with each group's vote counting for one-third of the tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL's all-star event will be staged February 2 in Orlando, Florida, for the second consecutive year as 88 players take part in skills competitions, including a flag football showdown with former NFL star quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning serving as coaches. (AFP)

<img alt="Angelina Jolie filed to dissolve her marriage with Brad Pitt in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Famed actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie signed off on a divorce settlement on Monday, according to US media, marking a turning point in the eight-year legal saga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed the settlement to People Magazine, saying in a statement that Jolie was "focused on finding peace and healing for their family."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago," Simon said. "Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over."
  <br>
  <br>
  No details of the settlement between the former power couple were immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed to dissolve their marriage in September 2016, and the pair has remained locked in a court battle since.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jolie filed for divorce a few days after a flight during which she alleged in court papers that Pitt "choked" one of their children and hit another during a plane fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the papers lodged in a Los Angeles court and widely quoted in US media, Jolie describes a lengthy eruption by Pitt as the couple flew with the children from California to France in September 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the ensuing years, the A-listers have clashed over custody of the children – three biological and three adopted – and more recently over the ownership of a luxury French property they bought together.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, the couple reached a custody arrangement for their six children, three of whom are adopted, though it appears to have since unravelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitt and Jolie first got together after co-starring as married assassins in the 2005 film "Mr. and Mrs Smith." Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston at the time. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday to end 2024 on a gloomy note, but investors capped a strong overall year that was boosted by tech stocks, interest rate cuts and a robust US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.1 percent to 42,544, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.4 percent to 5,881.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent to 19,310.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was kind of a disappointing end to the year," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, noting that markets have closed lower for a few consecutive days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed the selling in recent days involved "some large portfolios reallocating money from stocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "this year was phenomenal" overall, he said, noting that major indexes moved higher and major tech stocks dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key factors included semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks, with enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping the "Magnificent Seven" US tech heavyweights – which include Apple and Nvidia – this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns about the pace of US interest rate cuts and uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump's trade and tariff agenda could cloud the outlook, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sosnick believed "there's a lot of optimism about the coming year." (AFP)

 Hong Kong welcomed 2025 with a colourful fireworks display over Victoria Harbour as hundreds of thousands around the city celebrated the arrival of the new year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Themed "The Symphony of Happiness", the 12-minute show was in five parts. It kicked off with bright red fireworks, symbolising a fiery passion for life and dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second section used pyrotechnic technology, creating the effect of flowers blooming one after another. This was followed by green and gold fireworks, showing an evergreen tree representing the spirit of strong perseverance, hard work and quiet cultivation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth part was named the "Golden Waterfall". It took the form of golden fireworks cascading down the sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final section - "Propitious Clouds" - was making its debut in Hong Kong. It took the form of rainbow-coloured smoke with silver fireworks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sydney welcomed 2025 with a massive fireworks display at its iconic harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The self-proclaimed "New Year's capital of the world", sprayed nine tonnes of fireworks from its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge at midnight, creating a spectacle that was awash with vibrant colours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said more than a million people gathered to watch the display as British pop star Robbie Williams led a singalong while Indigenous ceremonies and performances acknowledged the land's first people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Auckland became the first major city to ring in the new year, with thousands of revellers counting down to 2025 and cheering at colourful fireworks launched from New Zealand’s tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a spectacular downtown light show.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands also thronged to downtown or climbed the city’s ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point, and a light display recognising Auckland’s Indigenous tribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a year marked by protests over Māori rights in the nation of five million people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Countries in the South Pacific Ocean are the first to ring in the New Year, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of citizens and tourists gathered along Victoria Harbour on Tuesday for the New Year's Eve fireworks display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crowd control measures were in place with a number of exits at Tsim Sha Tsui and East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stations temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some mainland tourists were excited for the fireworks display. They also found the countdown celebrations in Hong Kong “lively”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-minute show will cover a distance of 1,300 metres from Central to North Point. The fireworks will be launched at different heights and angles by five barges and 16 pontoons, arranged in two rows on the harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Service hours at the Lo Wu Control Point will be extended to 2am, while the Shenzhen Bay Control Point will stay open throughout the night, to facilitate tourist flows.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Plymouth Argyle have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Wayne Rooney after just over seven months in charge, the second-tier Championship club said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rooney had replaced Ian Foster in May on a three-year deal at Plymouth. However, the team struggled under his leadership, failing to win away this season, and are bottom with 18 points from 23 games, four points adrift of the safety zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United and England forward oversaw 25 matches in all competitions before his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the second setback for Rooney in 2024 following his dismissal as Birmingham City head coach in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First team coach Kevin Nancekivell and club captain Joe Edwards will lead the team for our Championship match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day," Plymouth said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rooney added: "Plymouth Argyle will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to look out for and take interest in their results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Birmingham manager in October 2023 when they were sixth but sacked in January after they fell to 20th in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 39 year old previously managed Derby County and Major League Soccer side DC United. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A flight attendant aboard a Swiss aircraft that made an emergency landing in Austria last week due to smoke in the cabin has died, the airline said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The flight from Bucharest to Zurich on December 23 was diverted to Graz after engine problems and smoke filled the cockpit and the cabin, Swiss International Air Lines said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the attendant died on Monday in intensive care in the hospital in Graz. The attendant was one of two crew members who were hospitalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 74 passengers aboard the Airbus A220-300 were evacuated after flight LX1885 landed safely, Swiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are devastated at our dear colleague’s death,” Swiss Chief Executive Officer Jens Fehlinger said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His loss has left us all in the deepest shock and grief. Our thoughts are with his family, whose pain we cannot imagine. I offer them my heartfelt condolences on behalf of all of us at Swiss."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public prosecutor's office in Graz has ordered a forensic examination of the attendant's body, Austria's APA news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also appointed an aviation expert and initiated an investigation into the cause of the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the incident, Swiss said it was also conducting an internal examination.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We want to thoroughly clarify the causes of the smoke and the effects on passengers and crew,” the airline wrote on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The focus is on the mechanical parts of the aircraft, such as the engine, but also on the use of protective equipment for the cabin crew, known as Protective Breathing Equipment.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said that China's economy faced the "pressure of transformation" but could overcome this through hard work, in his annual New Year's speech broadcast to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The current economic operation faces some new situations, challenges from the uncertainty of the external environment, and pressure of transformation from old drivers of growth into new ones, but these can be overcome through hard work," he said in an address broadcast on state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the economy had rebounded and was on an upward trajectory, with its GDP expected to exceed US$17.8 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said the country had fostered new quality productive forces and had seen new business sectors, forms and models emerging.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's annual production of new energy vehicles topped 10 million for the first time in 2024, while the country made breakthroughs in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields, Xi said in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi reiterated China's commitment to promoting global governance reform and contributing to the maintenance of world peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world of both transformation and turbulence, China, as a responsible major country, is actively promoting global governance reform and deepening solidarity and cooperation among the Global South," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said "Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties, and no one can stop the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president pledged China would unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau. (Xinhua/AFP)

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785658_1_20241231191117.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities on Tuesday said they were investigating the role of a concrete barrier at the end of Muan airport runway in the country's worst air disaster, which killed 179 people as a Jeju Air jet crashed on landing.
 <br>
  <br>
  US investigators, including from Boeing, were at the crash site in southwestern Muan, officials said, as South Korean authorities began assessing two black boxes retrieved from the burned-out wreckage of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plane was carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea when it made a mayday call and belly-landed before hitting the barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except two flight attendants pulled from the burning wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting South Korean President Choi Sang-mok, who has only been in office since Friday, said the accident was a "turning point" for the country, calling for a full overhaul of air safety systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He urged officials to "thoroughly re-examine the overall aircraft operation system... and immediately address any necessary improvements."
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials initially pointed to a bird strike as a possible cause, but experts have also flagged the barrier, with dramatic video showing the Boeing 737-800 bursting into flames as it collides with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked whether it was permissible for the airport to have used concrete in the barrier, director-general for airport policy Kim Hong-rak said the government would "review the relevant regulations and their application".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether this structure exacerbated the damage is... something the Accident Investigation Committee plans to investigate thoroughly," said deputy minister for civil aviation, Joo Jong-wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this stage, it is important to avoid focusing solely on any particular factor as the definitive cause of the accident," he said, adding investigators were reviewing "all potential scenarios to ensure a thorough investigation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae said that there were "no specific or unusual issues during the maintenance process" of the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for whether the landing gear functioned properly, that is directly related to the accident investigation, and we are not in a position to know at this time," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is observing seven days of mourning over the disaster, with New Year celebrations cancelled and flags flying at half-mast. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.

  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Safeguarding security among key duties: customs chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The new commissioner for customs and excise, Chan Tsz-tat, said on Tuesday that safeguarding national security is among the key areas of work for his team.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, 54, was appointed by the State Council in the morning to take over from Louise Ho who is retiring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said officers are well-trained to be able to detect materials at the border that are suspected of violating security laws, and they can then pass on cases to relevant bodies for follow-up action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, he also said targeting the newly popular drug, space oil, is another important focus for officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are fully aware of this new drug, which has become more popular in the market. So we have stepped up our enforcement on all fronts," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Up to December 22, we have arrested 12 persons, with seizures which will be able to produce as much as over 70,000 capsules for smoking by electronic devices."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new commissioner also said that so far this year, officers have dealt with some 19,000 cases of illicit cigarette smuggling at the border, nearly double the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By intercepting passengers who bring in excessive cigarettes, it's a very effective means to protect government revenue," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course we're currently working against syndicate crimes. We'll put more resources into the detection and investigation of major smuggling syndicates."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said other major areas of work include facilitating trade and convenient border-crossing, as well as cooperation with international customs bodies so the SAR can have a bigger say in international customs affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will work on internal team building and has already met seven staff-side unions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner said he was very honoured to be recommended for the post by Chief Executive John Lee and appointed by Beijing, adding that he cherishes the opportunity to lead the department.

 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday vowed to promote world peace in New Year's greetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the international situation changes, China will remain steadfast in further comprehensively deepening reform and promoting world peace and development," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying that both countries always move forward hand in hand along the right path of non-alliance, non-confrontation, and not targeting any third party.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said he is ready to maintain close exchanges with Putin and maintain the general direction of China-Russia cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted to Putin that 2024 marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, "representing a new important milestone in the relationship”, CCTV reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After three-quarters of a century of ups and downs, China-Russia relations have become increasingly mature and stable," Xi added. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Hart delivered his third triple double of the season on to spark the New York Knicks in a 126-106 victory at Washington that stretched their win streak to eight games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hart had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his ninth triple double with the Knicks while Karl-Anthony Towns had a game-high 32 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson and O.G. Anunoby each scored 18 points for New York, which improved to 23-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks led 59-57 at halftime over the Eastern Conference doormats, and pulled away in the third quarter and dominated the fourth to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We executed. We got stops and we played fast," Hart said. "We played to our strengths. Sometimes it takes us a little while to wake up – we always do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at New Orleans, James Harden sank four free throws in the final 17 seconds to give the Los Angeles Clippers a 116-113 victory over the host Pelicans – as the NBA's worst club dropped a 10th consecutive game to sink to 5-28 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norman Powell scored a game-high 35 points, while Harden added 27 as the Clippers improved to 19-13.

  Elsewhere, Chicago's Coby White had 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to spark the Bulls to a 115-108 overtime victory at Charlotte.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for impeached, suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol, investigators said on Tuesday, over his short-lived bid to impose martial law on the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule this month, plunging South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of his presidential duties by parliament over the action, but a constitutional court ruling is pending on whether to confirm the impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol, requested by the Joint Investigation Headquarters, were issued this morning," the Joint Investigation Headquarters said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conservative leader faces criminal charges of insurrection, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators probing Yoon over his declaration of martial law requested the warrant on Monday after the suspended president failed to report for questioning a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reason for the warrant is that there is a concern that the individual may refuse to comply with summons without justifiable reasons, and there is sufficient probable cause to suspect the commission of a crime," a Corruption Investigation Office official told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The warrant is valid until January 6," the official said, adding that Yoon could be held at a police station or the Seoul detention centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyer called the arrest warrant for the impeached president "illegal and invalid", saying investigators lacked the authority to probe the president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The arrest warrant and search and seizure warrant issued at the request of an agency without investigative authority are illegal and invalid," a statement from lawyer Yoon Kab-keun said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourism chief Rosanna Law has stressed that any operator is welcome to take part in a tendering exercise next year for the management of Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, adding that the existing firm would have to bring something new to the table if it wanted to stay on.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they will put managing rights of the terminal up for tender three years before the existing contract expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will also review the terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement to make the cruise terminal more attractive and competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the existing operator wants to join the tendering exercise, we'll review its performance over the years. We'll also look at whether the operator can adapt to the current situation, and offer new insights and suggestions," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for who will end up winning the bid, we're keeping an open mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed it would be too late to launch a tender exercise in 2027 being as the current agreement ends in May 2028, saying authorities have to give the new operator sufficient preparation time before taking over.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The State Council on Tuesday appointed Chan Tsz-tat as the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, replacing Louise Ho.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan joined the department as an inspector in 1994. He became an assistant commissioner in 2020, and was promoted to deputy commissioner two years later, responsible for the force's management and strategic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee expressed confidence in Chan's ability to lead Customs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Chan has served in the Customs and Excise Department for 30 years and has extensive experience in departmental operations. He possesses solid management and leadership skills," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also conveyed his appreciation to Ho for her contributions to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, 57, has proceeded on pre-retirement leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  She joined Customs in 1991, and became Hong Kong's first female Customs chief in 2021.

    'C919 can help HK grow into aviation engineering hub'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland aviation specialist says using the domestically-produced C919 aircraft for daily flights in Hong Kong will help the SAR become an aviation engineering hub.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern Airlines is deploying the narrow-body passenger jet on a direct route between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the first set of flights due to take off on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past 50 or 60 years, Hong Kong has worked as an [aviation hub], but due to the lack of a local aircraft manufacturer, it is not an aircraft or aviation engineering hub," Jason Li told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, was increasing its engineering investment in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, as you can see... COMAC is putting more China-produced C919 into Hong Kong. They are building an engineering team in Hong Kong," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can see that aviation [requires] a comprehensive engineering team. There are so many different parts; mechanical, electronic etc. So there will be much more career opportunities for local young people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the choice of Hong Kong as the C919's first destination outside mainland China shows the city's important role in advancing the national aviation sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is encouraging and letting more enterprises demonstrate their newest technology and the business in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Hong Kong's status as an international city meant the C919 would have more exposure to overseas clientele, such as those from Southeast Asia, the United States, and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said he expected more C919 jets flying into Hong Kong in the next couple of years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China Eastern Airlines currently has 10 C919s... I expect that in 2025, when they reach about 15 or 20, there will be an extra pair from Shanghai to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And for other carriers, for example Air China or China Southern Airlines - if they reach about five or 10 C919s - there will be flights from Beijing to Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should urgently address its ageing population as well as issues that come with demographic changes, according to family experts.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Asian Family Summit 2024, the experts also issued a warning about how declining fertility rates and rising life expectancies would affect the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rapid ageing is impacting all continents, especially Asia, where longevity has increased dramatically. And that's impacting care systems ... and investments have to be made," said Renata Kaczmarska, a social affairs officer at the United Nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demographic changes was one of four "megatrends" that the three-day conference looked at. The others were new technologies, urbanisation and migration, as well as climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patricia Chu, co-chairperson of the summit, said the four were not standalone issues and that Hong Kong had to deal with an ageing society.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[An] ageing population and demographic changes are the top priority... I think the government is aware of this and they are beginning to do more
  <br>
  ... on this front," said Chu, who also chairs the Consortium of Institutes on Family in the Asian Region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How [to] prepare and help the older generation to make the best use of [information and communication technology] is also another issue, which is integrated with the ageing population," she added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia and Ukraine swapped more than 300 prisoners of war on Monday in an exchange brokered by the United Arab Emirates ahead of New Year's Eve, officials from both countries said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have exchanged hundreds of captive soldiers since Russia began its military assault on Ukraine in February 2022, in one of the few areas of cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On 30 December, as a result of the negotiation process, 150 Russian servicemen were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, 150 Ukrainian army prisoners of war were handed over," the Russian defence ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv received 189 people as part of the deal, including soldiers, border guards and two civilians from the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working to free everyone from Russian captivity. This is our goal. We do not forget anyone," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine said Monday that Moscow had released a total of 3,956 people - soldiers and civilians - in deals with Kyiv since the start of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides said the latest exchange had been brokered by the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video published by Russia's human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova showed soldiers gathered outside buses, wearing winter clothes and military fatigues.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thank you for your service, patience and courage," Moskalkova said, wishing them a happy New Year's holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very soon our guys will embrace their relatives and friends and celebrate the New Year in their native land," she wrote in a Telegram message accompanying the video. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury verdict ordering US President-elect Donald Trump to pay US$5 million for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.
 <br>
  <br>
  A New York jury found after a nine-day civil trial last year that the former president had sexually abused Carroll at a Manhattan department store in 1996.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was ordered to pay US$2 million for sexual abuse and another US$3 million for defaming Carroll, a former advice columnist for Elle magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump denied the allegations and appealed the verdict on the grounds that two other women who said Trump had sexually assaulted them too should not have been allowed to testify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three-judge panel of the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We conclude that Mr Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carroll was awarded US$83 million by another jury in a separate case she brought against Trump. He has also appealed that verdict. (AFP)

    Villa held by Brighton after late Lamptey equaliser

<img alt="Brighton midfielder Tariq Lamptey (L) celebrates scoring the team's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785562_1_20241231074227.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

    Chelsea rocked by Ipswich; Man Utd lose 4th straight

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)

 US markets closed lower on the penultimate trading day of a year in which the benchmark indices have notched up strong gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.0 percent to 42,573.73, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 5,906.94, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.2 percent to 19,486.79.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sam Stovall of CFRA stressed that there was no major catalyst behind the shift, and the lead-up to New Year's Day was typically a low-volume period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, he expected that investors would be closely eyeing data that could give the US Federal Reserve reason to hold back on rate cuts, such as consumer inflation readings.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets have already reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls, investors are also monitoring further details of his trade policy -- after his threats of sweeping new tariffs on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some major tech stocks slumped Monday, with Tesla shares dropping 3.3 percent and Facebook parent Meta losing 1.4 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="The Development Bureau says it's appealing the ruling for the sake of public interest. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785522_1_20241230210005.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Monday that it has lodged an appeal against the High Court’s recent ruling that overturned the government's approval of an environmental study into plans to build public flats on part of the Fanling Golf Course.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the month, the court ruled in favour of the Golf Club and ordered the administration to relaunch a public consultation on the project’s impact on the environment, citing flaws in its environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, both the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) are appealing against the ruling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ruling would have significant systemic impacts on ongoing and future environmental impact assessments, in particular, it may lead to serious delays in development, operation and execution of the development proposals," the EPD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, noted that while officials had already secured enough land to meet the housing supply target for the next decade, an appeal is crucial because the ruling has far-reaching implications.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This appeal is not solely for the proposed housing project but, more importantly, for seeking clarifications from the Court of Appeal on important subjects concerning the principles and legal issues of the EIA framework. The government policy is to strike a balance between environmental protection and development for the overall benefit of Hong Kong,” it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had originally planned to build 12,000 public housing units at the site.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday said it wants to nurture and develop tourism by focusing on culture, sports, ecotourism and mega-events, with a view to boost the economy by HK$120 billion and create hundreds of thousands of jobs in five years.
 <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the latest blueprint for the industry, officials said they would promote smart tourism - such as introducing virtual reality elements at tourism attractions - to improve the experience of visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strategy would be to strengthen the city's appeal in traditional markets like the mainland, while attracting more travellers from the Middle East and Asean countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also wants to attract more visitors who stay overnight instead of only making day trips to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In five years, officials want a near 60 percent rise in the value the tourism sector adds to the economy, from last year’s base, to HK$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said there was a need to highlight the unique elements of the SAR, such as emphasising the city’s East-meets-West culture to promote tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Hong Kong’s beautiful shoreline, she said, officials would actively look into developing resort projects in the outlying islands.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will use our different routes to bring more tourists to our coastal landforms, our ecoparks, and also our beautiful seashore area in Sai Kung, and also on Lamma [Island] and Cheung Chau, all these areas, on Lantau," the minister told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will explore with other departments, the possibility of developing larger-scale ecotourism facilities such as hotels, spas or other facilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the government plans to promote horse-racing and cruise tourism while enriching some of the city's famous urban walking routes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said in five years' time, the government expects the sector to have created 210,000 jobs, a more than 40 percent rise from last year's figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added that regulators would look into changing the tour guide licensing regime, with a view to attract more new talent to the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, guides need to obtain a full licence by passing different tests on areas like ecotourism or history, but officials are now considering offering partial licences to aspiring guides.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’m pleased to hear that the [Travel Industry Authority] is considering a partial licence, so that people with a specific interest could actually focus on their areas of interest. By then, I hope that we’ll be able to attract and facilitate more people joining the tourism workforce," Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the government would otherwise import workers to the trade through existing labour schemes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Medical experts are calling on the public to maintain good hygiene and get flu jabs, after clinics reported a surge in infections.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president of the Hong Kong Medical Association, Cheng Chi-man, said on a RTHK programme on Monday that clinics have seen a significant increase in patients in the last two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said the SAR may see a more serious flu outbreak if temperatures drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winter in Hong Kong is generally mild. This Lunar New Year in January, the flu outbreak could be less serious as long as the weather isn't that cold and temperatures just fall to between 10 and 15 degrees" he said on a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if temperatures dip below 10 degrees, the outbreak could happen quickly and it could be more serious than in the past.”

    China expresses 'deep condolences' over Carter's death

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

    Govt to shift focus to talent retention: Chris Sun

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun says the government will shift its focus from luring talent to retaining talent in the SAR, adding the talent hunt will continue beyond international sports stars.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an exclusive interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Sun also said there are no plans to expand labour importation schemes to cover more sectors other than construction, transport and care homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recently, snooker stars Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan both became Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the fact that international sports stars come to Hong Kong via various talent admission schemes shows how attractive the city is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are internationally renowned sports stars and foreigners. They have many choices, but they chose Hong Kong. I believe this is the best way to show the world Hong Kong's appeal. It speaks louder than words," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue our talent search, not limited to sports stars. Through our talent schemes, we are searching for some world-class talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late 2022, around 175,000 people have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, adding around 350,000 to the city's population along with their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour chief added there are no plans to provide housing allowances for imported professionals as the government makes housing a priority for local permanent residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council (TDC) says it will lead a delegation to Indonesia next month to try to drum up business with Asean's largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 people, including senior executives and start-up bosses, will join the trip to Jakarta, visiting companies and taking part in networking events.
  <br>
  <br>
  TDC research director Irina Fan on Monday said Hong Kong is Indonesia's second largest investor, but the country is only the SAR's sixth largest trading partner when it comes to Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many of the enterprises that invest in Indonesia through Hong Kong are mainland subsidiaries or branches in the SAR. Their parent company is on the mainland, but they enter the Indonesian market through Hong Kong," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said figures from Indonesian officials show the SAR invested a total of US$18.5 billion in over 8,400 projects in the country between 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that Indonesia has been participating in the TDC's exhibitions, with products such as clothing, electronics and toys, showing that firms there are very much interested in reaching out to buyers from the mainland and elsewhere.
