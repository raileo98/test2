<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)

    Appeal crunch time for Blatter and Platini

<img alt="Michael Platini, left, with Sepp Blatter in 2014. File Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797152_1_20250324151246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and France football great Michel Platini will appear before a Swiss court on Tuesday to hear whether the case that finished their careers in football will end with their acquittals or convictions for corruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, once among the most powerful figures in global football, will appear at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court two-and-a-half years after they were acquitted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiss federal prosecutors rejected the decision at a lower court from 2022, leading to the new hearing in the town of Muttenz, near Basel. Both men deny the charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case relates to a two million Swiss franc payment Blatter authorised for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, which was made in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini and Blatter said the payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because Fifa lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The affair, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer body Uefa, torpedoed his hopes of eventually succeeding Blatter at the top of Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini were suspended from football in 2015 by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years. Although their exclusions were later reduced, the ban ended their careers as senior football administrators. The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world soccer's ruling body to pay Platini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work. This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties," the indictment said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment was credible, while there were serious doubts about the prosecution's allegation the payment was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years until 2015, has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Now a frail 89-year-old, he said he was the victim of a witch-hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, a three-times European Footballer of the Year, insisted the money was related to backpay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no corruption, there's no swindling, there's nothing at all," he said at the start of the appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Dominic Nellen said the case was designed to stop Platini becoming Fifa president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Platini was the most likely successor to Blatter in 2015, but someone wanted him out of the way," Nellen said. "At every turn there seems to be an attempt to stop Platini becoming president of Fifa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter was eventually replaced by Gianni Infantino, who had worked for Platini at Uefa. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, Platini, was banned from football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino has denied helping to bring about Platini's downfall, and said he only stepped up when Uefa asked him after the allegations against Platini emerged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors want a sentence of 20 months in jail, suspended for two years for both Blatter and Platini, and to confiscate the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides can appeal against the judgement to the Swiss Federal Court, the country's highest legal authority. (Reuters)

    Venezuelans go home as US deportation flights resume

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuela on Monday received nearly 200 citizens deported from the United States via Honduras, as US President Donald Trump cracks down on undocumented foreigners.
 <br>
  <br>
  A plane carrying the deportees touched down early in the day at Maiquetia International Airport outside the capital Caracas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we are receiving 199 compatriots," said Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live footage showed young men in sweatsuits walking off the plane. Some of them were seen smiling and clapping as officials looked on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes after Venezuela on Saturday announced it had reached an agreement with Washington to resume repatriation flights from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the latest in a string of repatriations of Venezuelan migrants since US President Donald Trump took office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Flights are resuming," Cabello said at the airport. "Trips have had little regularity, not because of Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to receive Venezuelans wherever they are," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deportation pipeline was suspended last month when Trump claimed Venezuela had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants, and Caracas subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then Washington deported 238 Venezuelans accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump has designated a foreign terrorist organisation, to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a move deeply criticised by Caracas. (AFP)

    Subsidy level for public healthcare 'unsustainable'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There's no way Hong Kong's public healthcare system will be sustainable in the long term if the government continues to subsidise nearly all of the expenses, according to an adviser tasked with reforming the body managing the hospitals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government is currently reviewing fees and charges for public hospital services, with a decision set to be announced in the coming days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franklin Lam, who sits on the Hospital Authority's Governance and Structure Reform Committee, stressed the need for patients to shoulder more of their expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently the government covers more than 97 percent of public healthcare expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every HK$100 spent, the patient only pays around HK$2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is the lowest in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, Lam pointed out that Singapore subsidises around 80 percent of healthcare costs for the underprivileged and less for those who earn more.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the latest budget in Hong Kong, healthcare expenditure for 2025/26 will reach HK$115 billion, a 5.6 percent increase from the previous fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you divide that expenditure by the labour force of 3.8 million, each worker receives around HK$30,000 [in subsidies]," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Public health expenditure is also 1.4 times the revenue from salaries' tax," Lam added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while fees and charges for public services could go up, he suggested it was "quite likely" there would be a cap for patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, there is annual cap of HK$10,000 for each patient...," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's about 2 percent of median family income.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Would people decide not to see a doctor just because they have to spend HK$10,000? I don't think so," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association also agreed on the need to adjust public hospital charges and called for understanding from all parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the possible adjustments could come from the accident and emergency department, with patients triaged into less urgent categories paying more than the current flat fee of HK$180.
  <br>
  <br>
  Association chairman Christopher Lung said he hopes authorities can clearly explain the fee schedule to the public, while providing adequate guidelines for medics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Patients are triaged based on objective data such as symptoms and vital signs. But sometimes they are not satisfied and get into confrontations with frontline medics," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lung also suggested the new fee levels align with those in the private sector so as to ease the strain on public hospitals.

    Govt to exceed family office target: treasury chief

<img alt="Christopher Hui says about one fourth of the new family offices had set up shop in the SAR partly due to the 'Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit.'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said on Monday he is confident that the government will be able to beat the target of bringing in over 200 large family offices by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The goal was set by Chief Executive John Lee in his Policy Address in 2022 as part of measures to cement the city's status as a global wealth management hub by attracting investment and capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with a local newspaper, Hui noted that the government's investment promotion arm, InvestHK, has already assisted more than 160 family offices in setting up shop or expanding in the SAR and that another 150 are planning to follow suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While over 80 percent of the new family offices are from across the Taiwan Strait, others are from the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Americas and Oceania, he added, noting that the total number of new family offices could be much higher than the government data as some might have set up shop via other agencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui also noted that the authorities plan to turn the upcoming "Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit" into an annual flagship event as one fourth of the family offices that had set up here had done so partly due to the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third edition of the event is set to take place on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, more than 2,700 single family offices have chosen Hong Kong as their base.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Hui noted that there are opportunities for growth in the city's family office business as global investors might "prioritise stability" amid the uncertain policy environment in the United States. He said the city provides a stable, sustainable and predictable business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government has introduced a bill to the Legislative Council to set up a "company relocation mechanism" to assist businesses in their relocations and that the legislative process of the bill could be completed in the first half.

    'Public flat tenants will have ample time to move out'

<img alt="The Housing Authority's Cleresa Wong expects at least a few hundred flats could be released after rules are tightened. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797127_1_20250324121128.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority on Monday said well-off public housing tenants will be given sufficient time to move out of their flats once rules are tightened.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the new rules, some tenants will be required to pay 2.5 to 4.5 times the standard rent starting from October.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, if a tenant's income is between four to five times the limit after two declaration cycles, they will have to move out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairperson of the authority’s subsidised housing committee Cleresa Wong said she expects at least a few hundred flats to be released after the rules are tightened, but she offered assurances that tenants will not be forced to move out immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tenants will only have to move out after they surrender their public flat and get another property," she told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They don't have to worry about moving and residing elsewhere temporarily, before being able to purchase a flat under the 'white form' status or a first-hand private housing unit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Lo Wai-kwok, who is also a member of the committee, said well-off public housing tenants would be able to afford the higher rents, adding that new policies can also encourage them to buy a flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Residential prices in the private market have gradually stabilised, and we have policies like the Home Ownership Scheme, and the 'green form' status. More tenants who can afford [it] may consider purchasing a flat," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Federation of Public Housing Estates Man Yu-ming, meanwhile, said it may be hard for some tenants to pay more rent, but he believes the changes could encourage upward mobility.

<img alt="Ticket exchange booths in Hong Kong and the mainland are open from today until April 7. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797121_1_20250324115705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker suggested on Monday that the ticketing platform Cityline deal with exchanges necessitated by printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets by post.
 <br>
  <br>
  The inaccurate information is printed on HK$1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour – delivered by DHL" standing tickets, according to Cityline's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of the seven ticket-exchange locations in Hong Kong, the platform has also added similar facilities in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  All booths will run from today until April 7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Yang Wing-kit noted that the two booths on the mainland are insufficient even though they are better than nothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be people coming from the mainland, or even Southeast Asia to see the concerts. If you only set up booths in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, maybe people in Shanghai will have to spend a lot of time travelling to Guangzhou or Shenzhen to exchange their tickets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will be an inconvenience. Couldn't we come up with other ways, such as mailing the tickets by post? That would be much more convenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Cityline should come up with ways to compensate those who are affected, such as by waiving the handling fee and offering priority bookings in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exchanges could only be carried out in the SAR, before Cityline announced late on Saturday that booths would also be set up on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aryan Sethi, a local ticket holder, was among those who headed to the Tsim Sha Tsui booth.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was satisfied with the exchange arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They've given us until April 7, which is at least one day before the show I booked for, so I think it's ok," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy they informed us as early as they could, instead of at least one week before, so I think it was ok."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some people, meanwhile, told RTHK that they only found out about the ticketing error on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is because they either did not get the email or only found it in the spam folder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British rock band will play at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 11am on Sunday, the Consumer Council has received 25 complaints over the incident.

    Local art space takes Art Basel on vampire adventure

<div class="itemFullText">
 Want to see vampires travelling through time and space? Local art space Para Site is turning Art Basel's film section into a sci-fi wonderland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from tradition, the SAR’s premier art show has handed over its film programming reins to Para Site – marking the first time an organisation will be in charge of curating the section.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're almost thinking of this programme like a film festival," said Para Site's executive director Billy Tang.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's something about that gesture that is very collective and collaborative. So we really wanted to use that to mark the difference of our approach as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and three others curated the film programme themed "In Space, It's Always Night", which includes feature films, videos and moving images by 30 artists from around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centrepiece is "Vampires in Space" by Portuguese filmmaker Isadora Neves Marques, which tells the story of a family of vampires travelling through the cosmos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang told RTHK that he wants to bring new perspectives and create dialogue between local and international artists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For an outsider, maybe people think a lot about Wong Kar-wai, and it's such a powerful legacy and becomes synonymous with the city," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we chose Isadora's film, we thought long and hard about that as well, because I think they represent a potential of something that could potentially in the future speak a lot about Hong Kong issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the videos in the programme titled "The Pixelated You" also features works by six Hong Kong-based artists, exploring the act of imagining others through imagery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the project aims to support the local art ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're trying to think within the visibility of the art fair, how to channel that to focus on different communities that represent the city, how also it can draw attention to the wider city as well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art enthusiasts can experience these otherworldly screenings at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai from March 27 to 30.

    HK strives to attain carbon neutrality: Tse Chin-wan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan said on Monday that Hong Kong will continue to strive for carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the SAR’s multi-pronged plan to achieve this goal.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a climate forum organised by the Environment and Ecology Bureau and University of Hong Kong, the minister said the city's efforts to achieve carbon neutrality have been bearing fruit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the building of coal-fired power plants in 1997 and have been gradually shifting to natural gas and nuclear power. Due to the efforts made, Hong Kong reached the carbon peak in 2014. Comparing to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, which is about 30 percent of that of the United States and 60 percent of that of the European Union," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, the government announced its Climate Action Plan 2050 which outlined measures for the SAR to combat climate change and achieve carbon neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  It consists of four major decarbonisation strategies, such as net zero electricity generation, green transport and waste reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said a new facility will be built to increase the proportion of zero carbon electricity to around 70 percent by 2035, along with an upgrade for the current cross-border electricity transmission infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  On transport, he said the government is expanding the city's electric vehicle charging network, and will stop selling private cars that run on gasoline or diesel by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added Hong Kong will stop using landfills to handle municipal waste by the same year to cut the eight percent carbon emission from waste disposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment minister also said Hong Kong’s first waste-to-energy incinerator facility will start operations by the end of the year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy striker Moise Kean admitted his team "got distracted" after Germany's Jamal Musiala scored an easy goal into an empty net when absent-minded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his post during the Nations League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany saw off Italy 5-4 on aggregate following a 3-3 second-leg draw to reach the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich, who scored the first goal for Germany, played a key role in the bizarre second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kimmich, seeing the Italian keeper had drifted off his line, took a quickly-taken corner that was flicked into the empty net by Musiala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got distracted. It can happen to concede goals like that. We'll work better on it next time," said Kean who scored twice in the second half as Italy rallied from a 3-0 interval deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said the quick thinking was "world-class and unbelievably smart," and admitted "I didn't see it at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  One person who did see it was 15-year-old ballboy Noel Urbaniak who noticed that Donnarumma wasn't paying attention and quickly threw the ball to Kimmich.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very sharp, which isn't bad in a game like this, he did well," said Kimmich who autographed and presented a match ball to the teenager after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He'll get a free ticket to the next home game," promised German football federation Rudi Voller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never been a ballboy before, this is my first time, and it feels really good," Urbaniak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy coach Luciano Spalletti blasted his team's lack of maturity over the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that they take corners quickly and must not turn our backs," said Spalletti. (AFP)

<img alt="Xia Baolong met EuroCham chair Inaki Amate and business representatives in Beijing last week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Monday welcomed last week's remarks from the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, who praised EuroCham's work in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong told a visiting EuroCham delegation to Beijing that Hong Kong had the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , EuroCham chairman Inaki Amate said the most important takeaway from the meeting was the central government's commitment to the long-term stability and prosperity of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had an opportunity to express our commitment to the Hong Kong SAR and to the measures that the Hong Kong and Chinese government are putting forward to ensure the long term stability that we need in the business community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amate also said the European Chamber of Commerce was working hard to encourage companies from Europe to set up operations in the city and contribute to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [firms] see that the potential of Hong Kong has not vanished. That there is still a lot that Hong Kong can offer to international firms in the way they can penetrate back into China but also can consider Hong Kong as a regional headquarters."

    Stocks open up amid caution over tariffs

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index opened 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, up at 23,749. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797110_1_20250324110326.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index climbed 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, to open at 23,749.58 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as financial markets made a mixed start with US stock futures rising but the dollar wavering ahead of a week driven by data, Chinese earnings and the threat of steep US tariff hikes on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures were up about 0.6 percent in the morning and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei climbed about 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The week holds global purchasing managers index gauges, the US Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading, inflation data in Australia and Japan, a budget update in Britain and major earnings in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is likely to be updates on US President Donald Trump's plans to for global reciprocal tariffs from April 2 that drives markets, and after a volatile month for stocks, bonds and currencies, analysts said there is no obvious trade ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to really devise a structural playbook," said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to put your mind into the head of the consumer and households," he said, since it has been fears of a slowdown in the world's biggest economy that has led to weeks of selling dollars and stocks and a strong rally for Treasuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anything that feeds into this higher probability of recession, higher probability of a stagflationary environment ... or that price pressures aren't transitory is where we start to get panicky a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to impose a complicated barrage of tariffs, the details of which are not clear save that they are to be calculated to reflect the impact of foreign tariffs as well as foreign value-added taxes on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong shares are up 18 percent so far this year, the largest gain of any major market, but a drop of 4.4 percent over two sessions late last week pointed to a pause in the flow of money while traders consider their, and Trump's, next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earnings at automaker BYD, video platform Kuaishou as well as Chinese banks and several property developers will be in focus. In the United States, discount retailer Dollar Tree and up-market athletic clothier Lululemon are on the calendar.

<img alt="Mirra Andreeva receives treatment from a WTA physiotherapist during an injury timeout in her Miami Open match against Amanda Anisimova at Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797104_1_20250324103923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva, coming off back-to-back WTA 1000 wins in Dubai and Indian Wells, exited in the third round, her 13-match winning streak ending with a three-sets loss to American Amanda Anisimova.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, the 11th seed, hoped to continue her rise up the rankings with a strong showing in Miami but appeared to be hampered by injury as she lost to 17th seeded Miami resident Anisimova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva received lengthy medical attention in her abdominal area when 2-1 down in the first set, which she lost 7-6 (7/5).
  <br>
  <br>
  She bounced back, dominating the second set 6-2 but Anisimova won the third set of the two hour and 49-minute battle 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anisimova will face Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, after the British player advanced when her American opponent McCartney Kessler retired injured in the second set of their encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year," said Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone," said Dimitrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils delighted his supporters defeating Spaniard Jaume Munar 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7/1). (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court dismissed the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Monday, reinstating him as acting president – a role he was given after the president was suspended for declaring martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Han's impeachment was dismissed in a 5-1 vote by the court's eight justices. Two justices voted to reject the impeachment motion entirely," Yonhap reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court ruling is the latest development in South Korea's complex and sprawling political crisis, which was touched off by suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's December 3 attempt to subvert civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  The opposition-controlled parliament impeached Yoon's replacement Han just weeks after he assumed the role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers cited Han's refusal to appoint more judges to the Constitutional Court – which will also decide on Yoon's impeachment – plus his purported role in the martial law debacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court only had six judges at the time, meaning that had even one judge refused to back impeachment, Yoon would have been reinstated. The opposition had called for three more to be appointed, taking the court up to a full bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to local broadcaster YTN, the court decision on Monday "explained that not certifying nominees is illegal, but not enough to warrant dismissal," in its decision to throw out Han's impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  YTN also said that the court "found no evidence of [Han's] role" at meetings related to planning the martial law declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han's successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two additional judges to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who immediately resumed the acting presidency after the ruling, thanked the Constitutional Court for its "wise decision".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere. I think there is no place for division now. Our country's priority is to move forward," he added. (AFP)

    Mark Carney calls snap Canadian election

<img alt="Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced the move at a news conference in Ottawa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797074_1_20250324055036.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday called a snap election for April 28, saying he needed a strong mandate to deal with the threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who "wants to break us so America can own us."
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments showed the extent to which relations between the US and Canada, two long-time allies and major trading partners, have deteriorated since Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex it as the 51st state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the next election was not due until October 20, Carney is hoping to capitalise on a remarkable recovery by his Liberal Party in the polls since January, when Trump began threatening Canada and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Upon being sworn in as prime minister on March 14, Carney had said he could work with and respected Trump. On Sunday, however, he took a more combative approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump's unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty," Carney told reporters after the Governor General - the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state - approved his request for an election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our response must be to build a strong economy and a more secure Canada. President Trump claims that Canada isn't a real country. He wants to break us so America can own us. We will not let that happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carney's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on March 6 delayed a broad 25 percent tariff on some Canadian goods for 30 days. He has since imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and threatened reciprocal tariffs on additional goods, including Canadian dairy and lumber, on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The polling suggests that the number one concern that Canadians have right now is the potential negative fallout of Donald Trump and the threatened tariffs," said Nik Nanos, chief data scientist and founder of pollster Nanos Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney is "probably setting the groundwork for something a little more strident on April 2nd," Nanos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney, a former two-time central banker with no previous political or election campaign experience, captured the Liberal leadership two weeks ago by persuading party members he was the best person to tackle Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he has five weeks to win over Canadians. On Sunday, Carney proposed cutting the lowest income tax bracket by one percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls suggest the Liberals, who have been in power since 2015 and badly trailed the official opposition Conservatives at the start of the year, are now slightly ahead of their rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We moved from an election where people wanted change to an election that's really much more about leadership," said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ability of the Conservatives to attack the Liberals has been greatly diminished, because people are focused on the here and now and the near-term future, not on what happened over the last 10 years," he said by phone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conservatives have sought to portray Carney as an elitist who plans to continue the Trudeau-era policy of high government spending. They also accuse him of being less than clear about how he transferred his personal financial assets into a blind trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney bristled last week when asked about the trust, and accused the reporter asking of engaging in "conflict and ill will". The prickly reaction could give hope to the Conservatives that Carney might stumble during what will be his first campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key to any victory will be a good performance in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. Carney had trouble at one press conference when asked to respond in French, first misunderstanding the question and then answering in English.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, on the other hand, speaks flawless French and is a seasoned politician who has fought seven elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we need to do is put Canada first for a change," Poilievre said at a press conference on Sunday to launch his campaign, adding that his policies, including tax cuts and increased resource production, would bring back investment, helping Canada become more self-reliant and better equipped to stand up to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laura Stephenson, a politics professor at Western University in the Canadian city of London, said Carney's inexperience might not be that important given the Trump factor. "I have a feeling we're going to see a little more grace extended than is usually given to politicians during this campaign," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An online Angus Reid poll of 4,009 people released last week put the Liberals on 42 percent public support and the Conservatives on 37 percent. Angus Reid said the margin of error was around 1.5 percent, 19 times out of 20. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leader Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a balanced scoring performance in a 120-91 victory at Utah.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jarrett Allen scored 18 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16 to lead six Cavaliers in double figures while Evan Mobley added 11 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a long season. We're going to go through some ups and downs, we're not going to play our best," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this streak had happened in November I don't think everybody would be tripping as much. This is all part of the season. It's all part of getting better. Won tonight. We've turned the corner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs, with the NBA's second-best record, improved to 57-14 after prior road trip losses at the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Phoenix, while the Jazz, with the NBA's second-worst record, fell to 16-56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland stretched the lead atop the East to five and a half games over defending NBA champion Boston but remain one and a half games behind Oklahoma City (58-12) for the NBA's best overall record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-0 run to open the second half lifted the Cavs ahead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got some stops and then got in transition and made some shots. That helped," Mitchell said. "This is a great win. Now we're got to continue to take care of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Filipowski led Utah with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Detroit, rookie forward Ronald Holland scored 26 points off the bench to lead the Pistons over visiting New Orleans 136-130.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Duren added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, which improved to 40-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons are two wins from their first winning season since 2016 as they seek a first playoff berth since 2019 and first playoff win since 2008.

<img alt="Mikel Oiarzabal opened the scoring for Spain in their second leg clash against the Netherlands. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797081_2_20250324074010.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Goalkeeper Mike Maignan saved twice in the shoot-out as France beat Croatia 5-4 on penalties after their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate, sealing a place in the last four in June.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus won 2-0 on the night with goals in normal time by Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembele at the Stade de France to wipe out their deficit from Thursday's first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  With no further scoring in extra time the tie went to penalties, where Maignan saved from both Martin Baturina and Josip Stanisic, while Franjo Ivanovic also missed his kick for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez both failed to convert for the hosts, but Dayot Upamecano scored when he became the seventh France player to step up, sparking scenes of celebrations on the pitch and in the crowd of 77,502.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who won the Nations League in 2021, will now take on title-holders Spain in the semi-finals in Germany on June 5, with the winners going through to the final three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile Croatia, who lost on penalties to Spain in the final of the last edition of the Nations League in 2023, will now start their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will go into qualifying Group L with the Czech Republic, Montenegro, the Faroe Islands and Gibraltar.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's progress to the final stages of the Nations League means they will not begin their World Cup qualifying campaign until September, when they will be in Group D with Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Nations League holders Spain reached the final four with a 5-4 win on penalties against the Netherlands, after a thrilling 3-3 quarter-final second leg draw had left the tie 5-5 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donyell Malen missed and Barcelona's Pedri slotted home to settle a gripping match in which the Netherlands came from behind three times to force the shoot-out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Oyarzabal opened the scoring for Spain but Memphis Depay levelled from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed Spain's second before Ian Maatsen rifled home to force extra-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal, who also missed a penalty in the shoot-out, scored a brilliant goal to put Spain ahead but Xavi Simons netted another spot-kick to force penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so nice to wear this shirt and to be able to score this goal," Pedri said, with his side facing France in the semi-finals. "We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Spain's struggles in Rotterdam on Thursday in the 2-2 first-leg draw, coach Luis de la Fuente made a handful of changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal and Dani Olmo came in for Alvaro Morata and Pedri, while Dean Huijsen made his first start, against the country of his birth, and excelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman brought in debutant Maatsen at left-back, giving him the unenviable challenge of shackling 17-year-old prodigy Yamal at Valencia's sold-out Mestalla stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's success in recent years has inspired their supporters and over 20,000 watched them train ahead of the second leg, which also served as a fundraiser for damage caused by the devastating storms which hit the Valencia region last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won a penalty early on when Jan Paul van Hecke clumsily brought down Oyarzabal, who scored the winning goal for La Roja in the Euro 2024 final last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Sociedad forward took it himself, smashing into the bottom right corner, past Bart Verbruggen's dive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal had a goal ruled out for offside and the Brighton goalkeeper denied Nico Williams with a superb stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 19, was jeered by the travelling Dutch fans, upset he did not choose to play for them, but Spain supporters backed him in response and he shone. (AFP)

    Filipino teenager Eala sends Keys packing in Miami

<img alt="Eala is the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since 1975. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797077_1_20250324055913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala, the 2022 U.S. Open girls' singles champion, who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growing up it was tough," Eala said in her on-court interview. "You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think – I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat – and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success," said the American.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza killed a Hamas political leader, Salah al-Bardaweel, on Sunday, the militant group said, as Palestinian officials put the death toll from nearly 18 months of conflict at over 50,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bardaweel was a member of the Hamas decision-making body, the political office, and had held posts such as heading the Hamas delegation for indirect truce talks with Israel in 2009.

  "His blood, that of his wife and martyrs, will remain fuelling the battle of liberation and independence," the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two months of relative calm in the war, Gazans have again been fleeing for their lives after Israel effectively abandoned a ceasefire, launching a new all-out air and ground campaign on Tuesday against Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Explosions echoed throughout the north, central and southern Gaza Strip early on Sunday, as Israeli planes hit several targets in those areas in what witnesses said was an escalation of the attacks that began earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the aim of the new campaign is to force the group to give up remaining hostages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel launched its initial assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas has accused Israel of breaking the terms of the January ceasefire agreement by refusing to begin negotiations for an end to the war and a withdrawal of its troops from Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hamas has said it is still willing to negotiate and was studying "bridging" proposals from US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m in Nanjing on Sunday to claim not only a first global gold in his favoured distance, but also a rare world indoor track distance double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, who had won the 3,000m on Saturday for his first world indoor title, clocked 3min 38.79sec to emulate the double claimed by Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie in Maebashi in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Neil Gourley took silver in 3:39.07 while American Luke Houser rounded out the podium (3:39.17).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is something special," said Ingebrigtsen, before adding: "A lot of things have changed and I'm not doing this because anyone else has done it before. So that's purely a coincidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to compare yourself against history and what others are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm only focusing on myself and I feel good to have done a lot of preparations, and that was always the main goal. It's not to do with something somebody else did before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I can do more, so I'll try to maximise that and grab the opportunity given to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen's victory also banished some of the Norwegian's 1,500m demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main goal is obviously to win both distances, but I would say so far a pretty good indoor season, getting out and succeeding with the things that I wanted to accomplish, so it's been good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, as his wont, was happy to sit at the back of the nine-strong pack as American Samuel Prakel took up the running in Nanjing, splitting the pack into single file.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian moved to the front with four laps to run, Britain's Gourley on his shoulder and Mariano Garcia of Spain also in the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen surged again, shouldering off Austrian veteran Raphael Pallitsch's clumsy attempt at a pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to try their luck was Portugal's Isaac Nader, but at the bell it was Ingebrigtsen in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gourley raced down the inside line of the far straight, but there was to be no Briton to spoil the party at the line, as there has been twice at the world outdoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian kept not only his speed but also his nerve to see off his rivals, crossing the finish line with a brief look over his shoulder and a wagging index finger. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis called on Sunday for an "immediate" end to Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip, and for the resumption of dialogue for the release of hostages and a "definitive ceasefire".
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am saddened by the resumption of the intense Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, with so many deaths and injuries", Francis wrote in his Angelus prayer, which was published Sunday as the 88-year-old was being discharged from more than five weeks in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I ask that the weapons be silenced immediately and that the courage be found to resume dialogue so that all the hostages can be freed and a definitive ceasefire reached", said Francis, who was set to return to the Vatican on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip is once again very serious and requires the urgent commitment of the conflicting parties and the international community", he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Pope Francis greeted and thanked the faithful from a balcony of Rome's Gemelli hospital on Sunday, the first time the 88-year-old has been seen in public since his admission on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you, everyone", a weak-sounding Francis said into a microphone, as he sat in a wheelchair waving gently to hundreds of people gathered below, and doing the occasional thumbs-up sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can see that woman with yellow flowers, well done", he said with a small smile, to laughter from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, who has spent over five weeks in hospital battling pneumonia, was on the balcony for two minutes then was discharged immediately. (AFP)

    Reed qualifies for British Open after Macau finish

<img alt="Patrick Reed playing a shot during the final round of the 2025 International Series Macau at the Macau Golf and Country Club in Macau.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Masters champion Patrick Reed qualified for the British Open after coming second behind fellow LIV player Carlos Ortiz at the International Series Macau on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican Ortiz also earned his spot at the major in Portrush, Northern Ireland, in July, after holding off the American for a three-shot victory at the Asian Tour event in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Kokrak also qualified as he finished third at Macau Golf and Country Club, three shots further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was one shot ahead of the 2017 Masters champion and another LIV player in Sergio Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard missed a three-footer for birdie on the last which would have seen him tie with Kokrak and secure a place at the British Open through countback based on his higher world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau tournament was added this year to the Open Qualifying Series for the first time, with the top three players who are not already exempt earning a berth at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  LIV players do not earn world-ranking points, severely restricting their chances of qualifying for golf's four major tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ortiz carded a final-round six-under-par 64 to triumph with a total 22-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, had shared the lead with Ortiz heading into the final round but had to settle for a runner-up finish after carding a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed's best performance at the British Open was 10th in 2019. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ticket sales for the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens are breaking records less than one week before the event kicks off at the Kai Tak Sports Park, according to the event's organiser.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated mega event will take place from March 28 to 30 at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China Rugby said 43,000 tickets have been sold, including 8,000 in the past week alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a capacity of 47,000, that means over 90 percent of all tickets have been snapped up. Only three-day passes remain, with each adult ticket costing HK$1,950.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser expects a total attendance of 138,000 over three days, a new record for the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby said the SAR squad is ready to compete, and is excited to be entering a new era of rugby history with the move away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Hong Kong, China teams have reached great heights both on the world stage and in the neighborhoods across the city. We look forward to together capitalising on the new opportunities presented by Kai Tak for our community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's and women's squads will be competing in the Melrose Claymores, a tournament which runs in parallel to the main Sevens competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's team will be aiming to defend their Melrose title, facing China on Friday and Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the women's team, who finished as runners-up to China last year, will play Kazakhstan on the opening day and Thailand next.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs have arrested an inbound traveller at the airport for allegedly smuggling cannabis buds into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old man arrived at the SAR on Saturday on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was subsequently stopped at customs clearance, when officers found around 10kg of suspected cannabis buds in his suitcase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected drugs are worth HK$2.2 million in market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  An investigation is still ongoing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs also reminded the public that drug trafficking is a serious offence, and offenders upon conviction face a maximum fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

<img alt="McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix with second placed McLaren's Lando Norris and third placed Mercedes' George Russell. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797037_1_20250323172831.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri led from pole to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren used a one-stop strategy to complete a dominant one-two with Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  George Russell was third in a Mercedes with Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen snatching fourth place after a thrilling late pass on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton came home sixth behind his teammate after his first Ferrari victory in Saturday's sprint race in Shanghai, when Piastri had been second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an incredible weekend, the car has been pretty mega," said the Australian Piastri, who had been running second a week ago in Melbourne' season-opener before a late spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very, very happy. The hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, so to go all the way to the end was a bit of a surprise, but a happy surprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris had to cope with a late brake issue which forced him to settle for second rather than challenge his teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton continues to lead the championship after two race weekends on 44 points from Verstappen on 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell started from second and knew it was imperative to try to grab the lead off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead he was squeezed by Piastri on the long first bend complex, which allowed Norris to surge past into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ferraris got past Verstappen on the same bend, relegating the world champion from fourth to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc lost part of his front wing when it brushed Hamilton's rear right wheel but it did not affect his pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton was the first of the front-runners to dive in for new rubber on lap 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the others followed for hard tyres with Russell getting past Norris in the melee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the McLaren showed superior pace and surged back past at the end of the pit straight with the help of DRS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton began to struggle on the hard compound and allowed his teammate past on lap 21 freeing Leclerc to go after Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 38 Hamilton had to pit again for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front five all stayed out as it became clear they were going to attempt to make the hard tyres last till the end of the 56 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen had nursed his tyres throughout the race which enabled him to have a late charge on Leclerc and pass the Ferrari at the start of lap 54.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haas finished with two cars in the points as Esteban Ocon was seventh and rookie Ollie Bearman 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other points scorers were Mercedes teenager Kimi Antonelli in eighth with Alex Albon ninth in his Williams on his 29th birthday. (AFP)

<img alt="Turkish people take to the streets to protest the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Istanbul mayor and CHP's presidential race candidate, in Kayseri, Turkey. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797031_1_20250323164214.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Turkish court formally placed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu under arrest as part of a graft investigation on Sunday, after a fourth night of mass protests sparked heavy clashes with riot police.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision was confirmed by one of Imamoglu's lawyers, with the court also due to rule in a second "terror-related" probe into the popular opposition mayor, whose detention has sparked Turkey's worst street protests in over a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No despair! Keep fighting!" wrote the main opposition CHP party on X, denouncing it as "a political coup d'etat".
  <br>
  <br>
  The news came as voters cast their ballots in a CHP primary to name Imamoglu the party's candidate for the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The long-planned vote was the event which triggered the arrest of Imamoglu, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was detained in connection with two probes alleging graft and "aiding a terror organisation", accusations which he on Saturday told police were "immoral and baseless".
  <br>
  <br>
  The move against him sparked protests in Istanbul that have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, unleashing running battles with police, who arrested 323 people overnight, officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls opened at 8:00 am local time with 5,600 ballot boxes in 81 cities. The CHP said the vote was open to everyone, not just members, in the hope of a massive show of support for Imamoglu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I invite our nation... to the ballot box. We are casting our vote to support President Ekrem: for democracy, justice and the future," said his wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, on X, shortly after voting with her son Selim.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local offices of the ruling AKP party. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang told a gathering of business executives in Beijing on Sunday that China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalisation, practise true multilateralism and strive to be a force for stability and certainty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering the opening address to the China Development Forum, Li called on global executives to capture the opportunities from the country's renewed innovation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum this year saw attendance by prominent business leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that the country would pursue economic globalisation despite "fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have preparations for possible unexpected shocks, which of course mainly come from external sources. Where necessary, the Chinese government will also introduce new policies to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese economy," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump since taking office in January amount to a 20 percent blanket hike on Chinese exports to the United States. Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs on American goods, including on US agricultural goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li underlined Beijing's commitment to opening up the economy and called on global businesses to resist "protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Vice premier He Lifeng said that China is willing to "engage in candid dialogue" with the United States to resolve issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two countries have "many common interests and broad space for cooperation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Steve Daines on Saturday met with He, during a visit to Beijing viewed as a bid to ease strained relations. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank has begun serving premature or critically-ill newborns across the city, just two months after it came into operation in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's first milk bank, located at the Children's Hospital in Kai Tak, has so far recruited more than 100 eligible donors and collected more than 300 litres of milk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paediatrician Rosanna Wong, the milk bank's director, said the numbers were "more than expected".
  <br>
  <br>
  She revealed the bank began distributing donor milk to the city's nine public neonatal intensive care units starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Priority is currently given to babies born under 32 weeks of gestation, or weigh less than 1.5kg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Other babies who require the milk will be those who have severe diseases like congenital heart disease, or after a gastrointestinal operation," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong called for additional donations from lactating mothers, saying they could help the bank extend its free service to less premature babies or full-term infants with special needs.

    'Organ donor sign-ups hit record, but more needed'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has urged more individuals to register as organ donors, as many patients continue to wait for life-saving transplants.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony honouring organ donors on Sunday, Lo noted that over 2,600 patients in Hong Kong are currently on the waiting list for organ transplants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while nearly 400,000 people have signed up on the Centralised Organ Donation Register - an all-time high - there still remains considerable potential for growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the number 400,000 is commendable, it still represents less than 6 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population, and less than 10 percent if we consider those over 18 years old. I have always been ambitious. 400,000 is an excellent figure, but history is meant to be broken," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to report an even greater number next year at this gathering, not just a modest increase. I hope we can see a significant rise in organ donation numbers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The health minister also highlighted two cross-border organ donation cases from recent years, benefitting a then four-month-old baby girl in 2022, and an eight-month-old infant earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed admiration for families who, even in their saddest moments, turn their loss into a gift for others, describing it as an act of great generosity that helps complete another family.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, James Fung, president of the Hong Kong Society of Transplantation, said that in the past two years, there were 54 deceased organ donors who saved 138 patients suffering from organ failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, there were 56 living organ donors, who benefited 56 patients suffering from kidney or liver failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fung pointed out that there were less than 30 deceased organ donors in each of the past two years, making Hong Kong among places in the world with the lowest organ donation rates.

<img alt="Financial secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong will continue to help mainland companies enter international markets. Photo courtesy of Paul Chan's blog" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797020_1_20250323141446.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial secretary Paul Chan pledged his support for Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries, saying they will thrive under the city's unique east-meets-west and inclusive environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan, who's currently in Beijing, revealed in his weekly article on Sunday that he had visited a leading pop cultural entertainment firm to learn more about the incubation of cultural and creative intellectual property (IP) products.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the enormous potential of the creative industry, saying IP rights holders can ride on the popularity of their products to develop toys, theme parks and even catering services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from meeting actual needs of the consumers, these IP products also focus on giving them a joyful experience," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan believed Hong Kong remains the ideal location for mainland companies looking to expand abroad, citing the city's advantages in sourcing capital, abundance of talent and professional services, and free flow of information.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Developing IP and extending it to different industries, this creates tremendous value. The mainland has a very rich culture, and is highly creative. Hong Kong can be a platform, and help mainland companies go global. We are very willing to do that," he told the company in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's creative industry workers, he added, not only understand the mainland market, but also possess global vision and are able to create content which resonates with the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing his latest Budget, the finance chief said the SAR government will support over 30 cultural IP projects in the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, meanwhile, will expand the scope of its target companies to bring in more creative firms that integrate innovation and technology, he said.

 The head of the Science Park called for a balanced approach in technological development, saying while research and development is important, the results must also be applied in practical and real-world settings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme on Sunday, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation CEO Albert Wong noted the SAR's strong fundamental research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the park is committed to helping startups and enterprises transform their technology into marketable products.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Wong's estimates, Hong Kong is home to over 4,700 innovation and technology companies, employing 40,000 to 50,000 people. He says those numbers still pale in comparison to cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, Wong said the SAR needs to focus on attracting more tech firms to set up shop here, noting the ongoing development of two tech projects in the Northern Metropolis - the San Tin Technopole and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also talked about how the Science Park has been helping startups gain exposure overseas. Dozens of tech firms were given a chance to showcase their products at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, as well as the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also send companies to other parts of the world. But US Silicon Valley is important because it is a mecca of entrepreneurship and startup. There's a lot to learn about early stage investment, about entrepreneurship, about product market fit," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Startups with great potential even have the chance to undergo six months of training in Silicon Valley through a booster programme. Five firms were earmarked last year, and secured over US$15 million of investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These five companies that went there last year, it was very, very useful. They have to survive and they did survive. That is why we're going to send another 10 companies there this year," Wong said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tennis star Coleman Wong pulled off the biggest triumph of his career in dramatic fashion, defeating 13th seed Ben Shelton of the United States at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old wildcard prevailed 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 in a thrilling three setter, despite letting slip a 5-2 lead in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always trust myself to play in these big stages," an emotional Wong said after the match. "This is for you Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182th in the world, becomes the second-lowest ranked player to reach the tournament's last 32 in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He already made history by beating world number 82 Daniel Altmaier of Germany in the first round, becoming the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's top men's player will next face Australia's Adam Walton, the lucky loser who's also enjoying a magical run at the prestigious Masters 1000 event.

    Protests continue in Turkey after mayor arrested

<img alt="A protester in Istanbul waves Turkey's national flag. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796993_1_20250323083846.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Huge crowds gathered outside Istanbul City Hall late on Saturday for a fourth night of protests over the arrest of Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who has blasted official allegations against him as "immoral and baseless".
 <br>
  <br>
  The demonstrations, which began in Istanbul on Wednesday, have since spread to more than 55 of Turkey's 81 provinces, sparking clashes with riot police in the country's worst street protests in more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imamoglu's arrest -- for "terrorism" and "corruption" -- came just days before he was to have been formally named as the main opposition CHP's candidate in the 2028 presidential race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dictators are cowards!" and "AKP (Turkey's ruling party), you will not silence us!" read some of the placards in the Istanbul protest on Saturday night, which appeared bigger and denser than the previous night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers charged the City Hall gathering shortly after midnight (2100 GMT) using tear gas and forcing those who could to take refuge in the City Hall building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many were arrested, according to AFP journalists, but no official data was immediately available.
  <br>
  <br>
  Riot police had earlier used rubber bullets, pepper spray and percussion grenades in clashes on the fringes of the rally, AFP correspondents said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the capital Ankara, riot police used water cannon to push back protesters, while in the western coastal city of Izmir police blocked a student march headed towards the local AKP offices.
  <br>
  <br>
  CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, addressing the massed protesters in Istanbul, told them they numbered "more than half a million".
  <br>
  <br>
  He vowed the mobilisation would "defend" Imamoglu and march on the courthouse where the mayor had been taken late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor was taken to the courthouse, about 10 kilometres away from the City Hall demonstration, with 90 of his co-defendants, protected by dozens of riot vans and a heavy police cordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Imamoglu's lawyers, his hearing on a "terrorism" charge concluded, while the hearing on a "corruption" charge was scheduled to follow in the middle of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police set up a tight security cordon around the courthouse while around 1,000 protesters stood nearby shouting slogans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, the 53-year-old mayor denounced the accusations against him as "immoral and baseless" in a statement released by City Hall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This process has not only harmed Turkey's international reputation but has also shattered the public's sense of justice and trust in the economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of the mayor's arrest badly hurt the lira and caused chaos on Turkey's financial markets with the benchmark BIST 100 index closing Friday nearly 8.0 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are here today to stand up for the candidate we voted for," 30-year-old Aykut Cenk told AFP outside the court, holding a Turkish flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just as people took the streets to stand up for Erdogan after the July 15 (2016) coup, we are now taking to the streets for Imamoglu," Cenk said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not the enemy of the state, but what is happening is unlawful."
  <br>
  <br>
  The unrest has spread rapidly despite a protest ban in Turkey's three largest cities and a warning from Erdogan that the authorities would not tolerate "street terror".
  <br>
  <br>
  "For four days, they have been doing everything they can to disturb the peace and divide our people," Erdogan said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The days when politics and justice are guided by street terror are totally in the past," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the evening, Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said the authorities would not allow anyone to enter or leave the city who was "likely to participate in illegal activities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have arrested 343 people since the start of the protests, the interior ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey's Journalists Union claimed the police had "deliberately targeted" journalists, saying many had been "severely beaten, shot with rubber bullets and had equipment broken".
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Imamoglu's detention, the CHP has vowed to press ahead with its primary on Sunday at which it would formally nominate him as the party's presidential candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has pledged to open voting to anyone, not just party members, in the hope of garnering massive support for the beleaguered mayor, who is widely seen as the only politician capable of challenging Erdogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Observers said the government would likely seek to block the vote. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British finance minister Rachel Reeves is eyeing spending cuts for government officials who work in departments to the value of around 1.5 billion pounds (US$1.94 billion) a year by 2028-29, The Times newspaper reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reeves will likely announce belt-tightening measures to get back on track to meet her fiscal rules next Wednesday when she delivers a half-yearly budget update speech alongside fresh economic and public finance forecasts from Britain's fiscal watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is expected to reduce the administration budgets for the civil service by 10 percent, saving around 1.5 billion pounds a year by the end of parliament, The Times said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move could put thousands of jobs at risk and covers back office jobs, including in communications and policy, and human resources, but will likely exclude frontline service roles such as the border force and prisons. (Reuters)

    Pope Francis to be discharged from hospital

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for more than five weeks, will be discharged from hospital on Sunday but will need a further two months of rest at the Vatican, the head of his medical team said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on February 14 with a severe respiratory infection that became the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Francis will return to the Vatican on Sunday, his doctors said it would take "a lot of time" for his aging body to fully heal.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they had prescribed the pope two months of repose, and had advised him against taking any meetings with large groups, or that require special effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recommendation for a period of convalescence of at least two months is very important," Sergio Alfieri, head of the pope's medical team, told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis, who was fighting double pneumonia, suffered four acute attacks of what the Vatican called "respiratory crises" during his time in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri said that two of the crises had been critical, with the pope "in danger of his life".
  <br>
  <br>
  The pontiff no longer has pneumonia, but is also not completely healed from a "complex" infection involving several microorganisms, said the doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alfieri emphasized that while Francis had used non-invasive ventilation through a mask over his mouth and nose to help breathe, the pope had never been intubated during his stay in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  One senior cardinal had said on Friday that the pope would need to "relearn to speak" after battling a respiratory infection for so long.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will take time before his voice returns to what it was before," said Alfieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  The doctor said the pope, who had gained some weight in recent years after using a wheelchair for knee and back pain, has now lost some weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We haven't weighed him, but he has lost weight, surely," said Alfieri. "But, let's say, he had some 'in reserve,' so it doesn't worry us," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Luigi Carbone, vice director of the Vatican's healthcare service, said the pope would have a nurse caring for him when he returns to his Vatican residence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Vatican said earlier on Saturday that Francis would make his first public appearance in more than five weeks on Sunday, to offer a blessing from the window of his hospital room before being discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has been seen by the public only once during his hospital stay, in a photo the Vatican released last week, showing the pontiff at prayer in a hospital chapel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Francis wants to come to the hospital window around noon on Sunday to give a greeting and blessing, the Vatican said in its brief statement earlier on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A period of two months rest for Francis could lead to significant changes to the Vatican's calendar of upcoming events.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope had been set to meet with Britain's King Charles on April 8, and to lead the Vatican's annual celebrations for Easter on April 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said on Saturday that the Vatican would decide about those appointments at a later date.

    Oscar Piastri on pole for Chinese Grand Prix

<img alt="Now in his third season in Formula One, the Australian already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796987_1_20250323065602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pumped Oscar Piastri seized his first Formula One pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday and said he had done the hairpin of his life to smash the Shanghai circuit record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Australian, who had previously only secured the top slot for 100km sprint races, told reporters his qualifying time of one minute 30.641 seconds was secured at the end of the straight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My first lap was honestly better than my second lap, but just at the hairpin at the end of the straight I lost a bit of time and didn’t do the best hairpin," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the second lap I was about two-tenths down on myself, so I kind of just went 'why not send it into the hairpin?' and I gained those two-tenths back and then found a little bit more in the last corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, without that, I was tempted to box (pit) before that. So I’m pretty happy now that I didn’t...I just did a good corner, that’s all."
  <br>
  <br>
  As he told his team over the radio, it was "the hairpin of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  Now in his third season in Formula One, Piastri already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite for a third on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would make up for the crushing disappointment of starting on the front row in his home race in Melbourne last weekend and sliding off while chasing winning team mate Lando Norris before finishing ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris leads the championship on 26 points, with Piastri level with Ferrari's sprint winner Lewis Hamilton on nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pole was the first for an Australian driver since Daniel Ricciardo for Red Bull in Mexico in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a racing driver, so I'm selfish. So it's nice to do it for myself but it is also nice to do it for Australia as well," said the 23-year-old, who added that he has Chinese heritage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pole position is a really good confidence boost. It’s obviously my first one. So it's always nice to tick that box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a good start to the whole year for both the team and myself, even if the points tally doesn’t look like that at the moment. So (I'm) happy with how things are going, and this is a nice step along the way." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is demanding that ticketing platform Cityline fix printing errors on some Coldplay concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement issued late on Saturday, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Cityline should deal with the matter swiftly so ticket holders would not be affected. The British band is due to perform at the Kai Tak Sports Park next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Cityline's website, the inaccurate information is printed on the $1,399 "Coldplay: Music Of The Spheres World Tour—delivered by DHL" standing tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cityline said it was extending ticket exchanges and adding locations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. It also apologised and said it would refund handling fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland ticket holders have also been complaining about Cityline on Tourism Secretary Rosanna Law's Xiaohongshu social media page.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Consumer Council said it had received 17 complaints as of 7 pm on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan visited two mainland firms in Beijing on Friday, highlighting Hong Kong's role as a gateway for business expansion and global market access.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan first visited a leading pop-culture entertainment company listed in Hong Kong, which operates popular intellectual property (IP) artistic toys. He toured the company's thematic park and met with senior management to discuss their business development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He welcomed the firm's plans to expand its physical retail network in Hong Kong and diversify services, noting that the SAR government is reviewing tax deductions for acquiring IP usage rights to boost the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, Chan visited a high-precision artificial intelligence (AI) firm specialising in intelligent sensing solutions for smart traffic management, autonomous driving, perception robots, and low-altitude economic applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, with projects in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, plans to establish its international headquarters and a global R&D centre in Hong Kong while preparing for a listing. Chan encouraged the firm to utilise Hong Kong's capital, talent, and professional services to expand internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan was due to attend the China Development Forum on Saturday and speak at the thematic seminar.

    Fatah movement urges Hamas to cede power in Gaza

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement called on its Islamist rivals Hamas on Saturday to relinquish power in order to safeguard the "existence" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men," said Fatah spokesman Monther al-Hayek.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on Hamas to "step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians' existence" if it remains in power in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007 from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, and subsequent attempts at reconciliation have failed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The territory has been devastated by an Israeli offensive in retaliation for the assault by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7, 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following disagreements over the next steps in a January 19 ceasefire in the Gaza war, Israel resumed air strikes on Tuesday, followed by ground operations the day after.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened to annexe parts of Gaza unless Hamas frees the remaining Israeli hostages seized in the October 7 attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 251 hostages taken that day, 58 are still being held, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel resulted in 1,218 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the war, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least three firefighters and a public servant have been killed in a wildfire in South Korea, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency in southeastern regions, authorities said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire, which began in Sancheong County on Friday afternoon, prompted the deployment of 304 personnel, along with 20 helicopters, according to South Korea's Interior Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 residents in 15 southern villages have been told to evacuate, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Four people – three firefighters and one public servant – have been confirmed to be dead," said a fire agency official.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wildfires occurred in several other areas across the country, with 16 instances reported on Saturday alone, according to the Korea Forest Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Interior Ministry later declared a state of emergency in Ulsan and North and South Gyeongsang provinces, due to "the extensive damage caused by simultaneous wildfires across the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forest agency has issued "severe" fire warnings, its highest level, in 12 locations, including North and South Gyeongsang provinces, Busan and Daejeon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancheong, in South Gyeongsang province, is about 250 kilometres southeast of Seoul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sections of the highways in the region have been closed as a safety measure, according to local reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Choi Sang-mok, South Korea's acting president, told relevant agencies to "mobilise all available equipment and personnel to quickly extinguish" the fire, his office said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two people including a girl were killed in an Israeli attack on a southern Lebanese town on Saturday, state media reported, after Israel launched air strikes in response to cross-border rocket fire.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Israeli enemy strike on the town of Touline resulted... in the death of two people, including a girl, and the injury of eight others, including two children," the National News Agency cited the health ministry's emergency unit as saying, describing it as a "preliminary toll."
  <br>
  <br>
  NNA had earlier reported a toll of one killed in Touline.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as the Israeli military said it was launching air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon after intercepting cross-border rocket fire.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said three rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting off air raid sirens in the region for the first time since a November ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam warned the country risked being dragged into a "new war" after months of relative calm following a November 27 ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. (AFP)

 Pope Francis will make his first public appearance on Sunday with a blessing and a wave from a window at Rome's Gemelli Hospital where he was admitted on February 14.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 88-year-old pontiff has been battling pneumonia in both lungs after being hospitalised for breathing difficulties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pope Francis intends to wave and offer a blessing from the Agostino Gemelli hospital in Rome after Angelus prayers," The Vatican said on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope has stopped using an oxygen mask. After an earlier series of breathing attacks, his breathing has improved and the Vatican said on Monday he was spending short moments breathing on his own.
  <br>
  <br>
  For most of the pope's hospital stay, including critical stages, the Vatican was publishing daily bulletins on the health of Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pope's illness and the long spell in hospital have raised questions over who might lead the busy schedule of religious events leading up to Easter, the holiest period in the Christian calendar. (AFP)

    Heathrow 'fully operational' again after fire shutdown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heathrow Airport said it was "fully operational" on Saturday but delays and cancellations were expected as Europe's busiest air hub resumed operations after a power station fire caused travel mayhem.
 <br>
  <br>
  The electricity substation blaze knocked out power at the London airport, closing it for most of Friday before some flights began to arrive and take off later in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shutdown affected thousands of passengers around the world and raised serious questions about the reliability of one of the UK's most critical pieces of infrastructure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today," an airport spokesperson said on Saturday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday's outage at an off-airport power substation."
  <br>
  <br>
  About 1,350 flights were affected by Friday's closure, according to the Flightradar24 tracking website. Around 120 Heathrow-bound planes were in the air when the closure was announced and had to be diverted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delays and cancellations were likely on Saturday as airlines scrambled to clear a backlog of flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight."
  <br>
  <br>
  British Airways said it expected to operate around 85 percent of its scheduled flights at the airport throughout the day. The airline would normally run about 600 arrivals and departures on a Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex," a BA spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect around 85 percent of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday's power outage at the airport."
  <br>
  <br>
  Restrictions on overnight flights have been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, according to the UK's transport department. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A secondary school said on Saturday that some students and teachers taking part in an exchange tour on the mainland have fallen ill.
 <br>
  <br>
  Those affected are part of a group that includes 120 students from the Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College who are on a three-day trip to Zhaoqing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said some people had developed gastroenteritis symptoms, such as vomiting and fever since Friday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  The school said they are receiving treatment at a local hospital and are in stable condition.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that it had notified the Education Bureau, the Centre for Health Protection and parents regarding the incident, and also taken measures to reduce the risk of infection to others.

<img alt="Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant soars above Cleveland Cavaliers forward De'Andre Hunter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796939_1_20250322180740.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin Durant scored 42 points as the Phoenix Suns reignited their playoff hopes with a 123-112 upset of the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A superb performance from Durant secured a third straight victory for Phoenix as they aim to muscle their way into the postseason picture in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Durant erupted for 19 points in a third-quarter burst of scoring that took the game beyond Cleveland's grasp, with the Suns opening up a 98-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter which they never looked like letting slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Phoenix into 10th place in the Western Conference and into the play-in tournament reckoning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in each NBA conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while teams placed from 7th to 10th play in a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the best team in the league," Durant said of Cleveland following the Suns win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been struggling and we know we've got the toughest schedule for the last 10 games," he added. "So we just wanted to dial in and make sure we kept building on the work we've done over the last week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's fourth consecutive loss leaves the second-placed Boston Celtics just five wins behind the Cavs at the top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 51-19 after thrashing the Utah Jazz 121-99 on the back of 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis and 26 points from Jayson Tatum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Detroit Pistons' progress towards the playoffs suffered a jolt in a surprising 123-117 defeat on the road to the struggling Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs – whose season has been blown off course by the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers and a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving – powered to a precious victory thanks to 31 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 27 from PJ Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves Dallas perched on the edge of playoff contention in 11th place with a 34-37 record in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit occupy the sixth and last automatic playoff berth in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the loss, the Pistons will fancy their chances of locking down a postseason ticket given a vastly superior record – 39-32 – to seventh-placed Atlanta (33-36).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their successful clinching of the number 1 seeding on Thursday with a ruthless 141-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder were assured of top spot in the West despite not playing on Thursday after the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat to Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points as no fewer than eight OKC players finished in double figures in a wire-to-win which leaves the Thunder with a 58-12 record at the top of the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said he wanted to see his team play with the same intensity for the remainder of the regular season as they build towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got to play with a sense of purpose – you can't coast into the postseason," Daigneault said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great 48-minute effort. We played to our standards on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  With OKC already assured of top spot, Houston boosted their hopes of clinching second place in the West after rallying from 11 points down to squeeze past the Miami Heat, winning 102-98 on the road to bag their ninth consecutive win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet was the key man for Houston, finishing with 37 points after a devastating exhibition of long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  VanVleet drained nine-of-11 attempts from outside the arc as the Rockets improved to 46-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves remain hard on the heels of the sixth-placed Golden State Warriors (41-29) in the race for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves, who are one place behind Golden State, improved to 41-31 after a 134-93 pasting of the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another upset, the Portland Trail Blazers outgunned the injury-hit Denver Nuggets 128-109. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Health said on Saturday that a 35-year-old woman remains in a critical condition, after she was sedated before a tooth extraction at a dental clinic in Central two months ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deep sedation was used before the surgery, and the woman failed to wake up after the extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was sent to hospital immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the incident, the clinic stopped offering sedation to patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clinic also reported the sentinel event to the department and it has submitted an investigation report as requested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department will decide whether or not to take any further action.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the investigation, the department also found that the clinic did not properly manage patients’ medical records and medication, nor implement effective infection control.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure patient safety, the department has requested that the clinic improve its procedures.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of people flocked to Ocean Park on Saturday as they can now see the panda twins and their mother, Ying Ying, all in one go.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors who collect an entry ticket can meet the pandas for three minutes, though all tickets for the last session at 4:20 pm were gone by noon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park distributed more than 3,000 entry tickets in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau, a frequent visitor, said she arrived one and a half hours before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want to capture the first moments of the panda twins, and I'm really looking forward to seeing Ying Ying with her babies. That’s why I need to arrive early,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another tourist, Chan and her husband spent HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opened.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s worth the price. Because the panda twins will grow up and the money will be used to take care of them. So we think it’s ok,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her husband said it’s a remarkable experience seeing Ying Ying licking her babies clean.

<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi and South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul shake hands as Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya looks on. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796925_1_20250322153847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday that China, Japan and the South Korea have agreed to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, and deepen cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang made the remarks in Tokyo while meeting the press together with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, after attending the 11th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the three countries fully affirmed the positive progress made in their cooperation since the Ninth China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit, Wang said they agreed that against the backdrop of a complex and turbulent international landscape and sluggish recovery of the world economy, it is necessary and responsible for the three sides to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and provide more stabilising factors for regional peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  First, Wang said, they agreed to consolidate the momentum of cooperation. The three countries will stay true to the original aspiration of cooperation, focus on the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade, and expand new areas, cultivate new growth drivers, and create new highlights of cooperation on the basis of implementing the cooperation centred on six key areas determined by the leaders' meeting last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three parties had useful communication on holding the 10th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit this year, and will strive to create favourable conditions and atmosphere for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second, they agreed to promote regional economic integration. The three countries will continue to communicate on restarting the negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement, promoting the expansion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and maintaining the stability and smoothness of regional production and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three countries will keep pace with the times to build a highland of scientific and technological innovation in Asia and promote the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third, they agreed to deepen exchanges and mutual learning. The three countries will hold the China-Japan-ROK Year of Cultural Exchange from 2025 to 2026, strive to increase the number of people-to-people exchanges among the three countries to 40 million by 2030, and consolidate the public opinion basis for trilateral cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strengthening cooperation in social welfare, green and low-carbon development and other fields can bring more and better benefits to the people of the three countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth, they agreed to enhance multilateral cooperation. The three countries will strengthen coordination and cooperation under mechanisms such as ASEAN Plus Three and the East Asia Summit, promote "Trilateral+X Cooperation" to the surrounding areas, and drive common development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will support each other in hosting Apec meetings, promote open regionalism, uphold multilateralism and free trade, and push for more universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that the three countries fully affirmed the work of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, and agreed to extend the term of the Secretariat's consultative committee, looking forward to the Secretariat playing a greater role in promoting trilateral cooperation. (Xinhua)

 The Transport Department on Saturday said it received almost 37,000 online applications for vehicle licence renewals in the first two months of the year, a more than 80 percent year-on-year increase.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department rolled out an enhanced scheme in December last year to simplify the licensing process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the change, the vehicle licence is no longer printed with an expiry date, so vehicle owners don't need to replace it with a new one after each renewal.
  <br>
  <br>
  A QR code is printed on the licence instead, allowing vehicle owners to scan and check their expiry date.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vehicle owners also no longer need to present the vehicle registration document when applying for a licence renewal. They can even skip uploading their third-party insurance certificate if the application is made online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the department has issued more than 190,000 such new vehicle licences.

    Scheme aims to identify patients with high cholesterol

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commissioner for primary healthcare Pang Fei-chau said on Saturday that it is expected more patients will be detected with high cholesterol after a government-led primary healthcare scheme expands to cover blood lipid testing from Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, launched in November 2023, was set up to detect chronic diseases at an early stage. Under the scheme, the government will subsidise residents aged 45 or above with no known medical history of diabetes or hypertension, to undergo screenings for high blood sugar and high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far, over 60,000 people have been screened under the pilot scheme, and nearly 40 percent were diagnosed with diabetes, high blood sugar, or high blood pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from Friday, the screenings will be expanded to blood lipid testing so people can find out whether they have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Pang said it is thought four percent of those screened might have high cholesterol.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said treatment would have to be tailored to their needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Three highs affect our cardiac health. If a person already has diabetes and also has high cholesterol, his or her risk of heart and blood vessel disease is high,” Pang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, if a person only has high cholesterol, the risk is different. Therefore, we will reassess the cardiac risk for people who have three highs,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eligible residents can undergo the screenings through pairing with a family doctor of their choice. Residents will be charged a co-payment fee of about HK$150 for doctor consultations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pang said about 650 doctors have joined the scheme. He hopes they can share their experiences with industry peers so more doctors can join the scheme.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton dominated from pole position to take his maiden victory for Ferrari in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, on just his second race weekend for the Scuderia, took the chequered flag ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton emerged from his car after the finish line to a crescendo of cheers from the massed Shanghai fans who unfurled huge banners displaying the Englishman's number 44.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people underestimate the steep climb it is to get into a new team, understand a new team," said a delighted Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it is great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car as in Melbourne I really didn't feel comfortable in the car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt great today, I got a good start. I don't feel the pressure, I know the team wants to win and it means everything to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rome wasn't built in a day, so one day at a time."
  <br>
  <br>
  His former teammate at Mercedes, George Russell, was fourth and his current teammate Charles Leclerc was fifth in the other Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda in an RB was sixth, Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes was seventh and championship leader Lando Norris, who struggled for pace, took a solitary point in eighth for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton got away safely from pole after setting a blistering lap record on Friday at the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of lap three he was 1.1 seconds ahead and out of DRS range from Verstappen with Piastri a further 1.6 seconds back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris started sixth but was caught up in traffic on turn five and dropped to ninth, outside the points, as he was passed by Antonelli, Tsunoda and Lance Stroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell took advantage of the melee to nip past Leclerc into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen ran in second but was put under huge pressure by Piastri with five laps to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of my front tyres are dead," the Dutch reigning world champion complained on team radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 16 Piastri got past Verstappen at the hairpin and set off after Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian could not make inroads and the Englishman managed his tyres to perfection in the clean air at the front of the field. (AFP)

    SAR government preparing WTO complaint

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Saturday that the government is preparing to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regarding US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US has imposed an additional 20 percent duty on goods from Hong Kong, the same as for mainland China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Yau accused Donald Trump’s government of violating WTO agreements, which state that the SAR is a separate customs territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The executive orders of the US government noted that they are imposing new tariffs on goods from mainland China. But the Department of Homeland Security and Customs said the rule includes products of Hong Kong. This is a violation of the WTO agreement and it is completely wrong to mingle Hong Kong goods with those of China,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said the levies have a minimal impact on Hong Kong, noting the US has had a trade surplus of US$270 billion with the SAR over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau also said that despite rising geological tension between the US and China, foreign investors still have confidence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the last two years we’ve seen an increase of more than 900 foreign enterprises. And in 2024, there were 539 more, creating more than 7,000 jobs and HK$67 billion in investments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said the administration would continue to help local businesses find new opportunities in emerging markets, including ASEAN and Latin America.

    Boxing legend George Foreman dies aged 76

<img alt="The former heavyweight boxing champion is renowned for his iconic battle with Muhammad Ali. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796902_1_20250322102434.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who fought and lost against Muhammad Ali in boxing's iconic 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday aged 76, his family announced in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family said in a statement posted on the boxer's official Instagram page.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Texas on January 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in Houston. The man who raised him was frequently absent and often drunk. Foreman only found out that J. D. Foreman was not his biological father after he won the world heavyweight when his real father, a decorated Second World War veteran, got in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an adolescent Foreman flirted with crime and dropped out of school at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood," his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024. "And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 16, he took up boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to a football player," Foreman said on his website. "I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Mexico Games in 1968, the 19-year-old Foreman bludgeoned his way to the super-heavyweight gold. As he celebrated his final victory, 10 days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos had made a black power salute following the 200m track final, Foreman waved an American flag in the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 6-foot-4 (1.93m), 'Big George' was larger and stronger than the other leading heavyweights of the time. He was light on his feet, but slugged his way through the professional ranks, to earn a heavyweight title shot against champion Joe Frazier, demolishing the champion in two rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the time he fought his third title defence over 15 rounds against Ali in October 1974 in Kinshasa, Foreman was unbeaten in 40 professional bouts. He had won all but three inside the distance and had not needed to develop stamina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ali's 'rope-a-dope' tactics, exhausted the big man who lost in eight rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat punctured Foreman's intimidating aura, not least, in his own mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title," he said later. "It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign for another title shot ended when he lost on points to another contender, Jimmy Young in March 1977 on a hot night in Puerto Rico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman fell ill after the fight and said he sensed God telling him to change his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  He retired, aged 28 and became an ordained minister. When he announced his comeback 10 years later, bald where he had once sported an afro and flabby instead of chiseled, it seemed like a boxing gimmick. He wrote later that he needed money for his youth centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Knockout -
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three years he fought 21 times, mostly against mediocre opponents, winning every bout, 20 of them inside the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A big name in a weakened and fragmented division, he earned a title shot against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and then against Tommy Morrison two years later, losing both on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 1994 he faced Michael Moorer, who had dethroned Holyfield. In the same shorts he had worn 20 years and six days earlier against Ali, Foreman was trailing badly when he caught Moorer on the chin in the 10th for a knockout. At 45 years and 299 days old he was the oldest heavyweight world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of first his WBA title and then his IBF title for refusing to fight nominated opponents but won three more fights and was still 'lineal' world champion when he lost on points to Shannon Briggs in 1997, aged 48, and retired again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He fought 81 times as a professional, winning 76, 68 of those by a knockout.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, he put his name to the "George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine", appearing smiling and friendly in the TV ads, becoming a celebrity outside boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman, who hosted a 1996 TV programme 'Bad Dads', married four times, fathering 10 children and adopting two.
  <br>
  <br>
  He named all his five sons George Edward, explaining that he wanted them to know, "'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!'" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR says Light Rail services are returning to normal after several routes in Tin Shui Wai were disrupted on Saturday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  It took maintenance staff about four hours to fix an overhead line near Tin Yuet, which had been damaged by a crane lorry at around 7:30 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Routes 705, 706 and 751 were diverted as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MTR asked people to use other forms of public transport while laying on free shuttle buses for affected passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police later arrested the 41-year-old crane lorry driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. The force said no one was hurt in the incident.

    French film star Depardieu to go on trial next week

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 French actor Gerard Depardieu faces trial on Monday over alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set, a case placing one of the world's best known movie stars at the heart of France's broader reckoning over sexual violence.
 <br>
  <br>
  A towering figure of French cinema, Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years. Depardieu, 76, has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and this would be the first case for which he would be standing trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's lawyer, Jeremie Assous, said the case was based on "false accusations" against his client, adding that the movie star was expected to attend the two-day trial after an initial hearing was postponed due to his ill health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors say the assaults took place during the filming in 2021 of "Les Volets Verts" (The Green Shutters).
  <br>
  <br>
  They accuse Depardieu of groping one of the women on the film set, pulling her towards him and trapping her with his legs before touching her waist, hips and breasts while saying obscene words. Three people witnessed the scene, prosecutors say.
  <br>
  <br>
  They say the second woman was groped by Depardieu on set and in the street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's identities have not been revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alleged assaults occurred while Depardieu was under formal investigation over accusations of raping a young actress in 2018. A trial has been requested by prosecutors in the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lawyer for one of the women said her client was scared to come forward against Depardieu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a fear, because he's a cinema giant," said Carine Durrieu-Diebolt. "It's a struggle between David and Goliath and they are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawyer for the second plaintiff did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Depardieu's trial could be the highest-profile #MeToo case to come before the courts in France, a country where the protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction as in the United States. (Reuters)

 Donald Trump announced on Friday that Boeing has been awarded the contract for the Air Force's next-generation stealth fighter plane, which the 47th US president said would be named the F-47.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47. The generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number, F-47," said Trump at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contract aims to develop the replacement for the F-22 jet, which has been in operation for some two decades, with a new, more advanced aircraft able to operate alongside uncrewed drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) platform to Boeing," Trump said in televised remarks in the Oval Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the price of the contract could not be revealed for security reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, speaking alongside Trump, said the new aircraft "sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we're not going anywhere and to our enemies that... we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement is a boon for Boeing, which faced a difficult last year in which it struggled with a lengthy labour strike and safety problems on its civilian airliners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NGAD effort was paused in 2024 over cost concerns, a major focus of the Trump administration, which has tasked billionaire donor Elon Musk with slashing government spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
  <br>
  <br>
  The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the NGAD airframe could cost up to US$300 million apiece—significantly more than various other aircraft currently in the US inventory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, "officials cast doubt on whether the Air Force could afford to develop the NGAD alongside programs including the B-21 Raider bomber and the Minuteman III ICBM replacement," the Congressional Research Service said in a report earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The F-47 will replace the F-22 Raptor, which features stealth technology, a high degree of manoeuvrability, and the ability to supercruise, or maintain supersonic flight without afterburners. (AFP)

 China and Japan should enhance mutual trust and cooperation to provide global stability amid complex international challenges, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that since Ishiba took office, China-Japan ties have improved, highlighted by a productive meeting between President Xi Jinping and the Japanese leader in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan, both with important influence, should work together to build a better future for Asia, Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged Japan to uphold the principles of four key political documents, safeguard the political and legal foundations of bilateral ties, and honour commitments on historical issues, including Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for constructive engagement as the 80th anniversary of Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression approaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to strengthening ties, recognising the significance of bilateral agreements, and deepening cooperation to benefit both nations. (Xinhua)

    Separate fees for radiology services 'minimal': HA

 Requiring patients to pay separately for tests and scans at public hospitals will leave them with a "minimal" financial burden as such services will still be "highly subsidised" by the government, health officials say amid plans to adjust medical fees.
 <br>
  <br>
  Currently, the government covers the cost of diagnostic radiology services at public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said it may charge separately for services such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, although emergency and hospitalised patients will remain exempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials say they hope hospital fees can be adjusted to a level where there would be a reasonable co-payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, a director at the Hospital Authority, said Hongkongers will likely be asked to pay a certain amount for "more complicated" radiology services, but this should not cost them too much.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This co-payment should still be a highly subsidised amount [from the government]. The public should expect the co-payment to be minimal, and [it] will not affect most of the patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the patients really have some financial difficulties in paying that small amount, they can still apply for a fee exemption or reduction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Introducing a co-payment model could be a way to tackle patient no-shows, Wong said, with around 10 percent of them missing scheduled appointments for medical imaging tests like CT and MRI scans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, [we] could reduce this proportion of patients defaulting their attendance, and they could release the appointments for some other patients," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Lee, who chairs the authority's coordinating committee in radiology, said there were also cases of patients attending a scheduled appointment despite no longer requiring a check-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of them, who had scheduled for a scan due to certain symptoms presented at the time of the medical consultation, had been treated for and recovered from their ailments before they could undergo the test, Lee explained.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel made a winning start to his England reign without delivering on his promise of a vibrant new era as the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel had urged England to play without fear after claiming they were "afraid" in a scathing assessment of their Euro 2024 runners-up finish under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the early returns were underwhelming as Tuchel's side dominated possession at Wembley without providing much entertainment for the sell-out 82,378 crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is far too early to judge Tuchel, the German -- England's third non-British manager -- must know significant improvements are needed on the road to next year's World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18 years and 176 days, Myles Lewis-Skelly made history in the first half when the Arsenal defender became the youngest player to score on his England debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the highlight of an inconsistent England display which was hard to distinguish from the erratic fare served up by Southgate during his eight years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Harry Kane, who played under Tuchel at Bayern Munich last season, netted late in the second half to put a more flattering gloss on the Group K opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old's 70th international goal came just 24 hours after England's record scorer claimed people were "bored" of his achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel was greeted with a banner unfurled by fans with the slogan "Welcome to the home of football Thomas" as he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  True to his word, Tuchel did not sing the English national anthem after saying he had to "earn the right" and there were few songs of praise for Tuchel as Wembley started to empty well before the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel, whose side host Latvia on Monday, at least avoiding become the first England boss since Bobby Robson in 1982 to fail to win his first match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel gave debuts to Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn, who scored in Sunday's League Cup final win at Wembley, while Marcus Rashford was given a starting berth after his revival on loan at Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three looked comfortable in Tuchel's 4-2-3-1 formation but England could only muster a workmanlike start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel stood in the technical area making occasional notes and clapping vigorously when England followed his demand for a high press to win the ball back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was even more animated in the 20th minute as his decision to select Lewis-Skelly paid rich dividends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jude Bellingham was the catalyst as he deftly turned to find space in midfield before stroking a sublime pass towards Lewis-Skelly, who timed his run perfectly to slot home from close-range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel pumped his arms in celebration, with a sheepish grin spreading across his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smile was nearly wiped from his face when Burn's miscued block from Qazim Laci's cross hit the bar in a panicked sequence that ended with the defender heading off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham's diving header was repelled by Thomas Strakosha before Kane's follow-up was brilliantly blocked by Berat Djimsiti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn almost reprised his Wembley goal against Liverpool last weekend with a towering header that clanged off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel's hope that England would play with more intensity wasn't helped by the soporific atmosphere, a stark contrast the Premier League passion he wants his team to emulate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane headed narrowly wide from Bellingham's cross after the interval, but England laboured to kill off an Albania side content to sit deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finally landed the knockout blow in the 77th minute as Declan Rice's cross reached Kane and he swivelled to curl into the far corner from 10 yards. (AFP)
