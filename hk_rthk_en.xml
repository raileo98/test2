<img alt="Winnie Ho says extending the grace period for subdivided flat conversions can be considered. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791840_1_20250216120131.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said on Sunday that the government is considering extending a grace period for landlords to convert subdivided flats, after new laws are introduced to regulate the compact homes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials had initially proposed a transitional period of up to two years for the registration of such flats, known as "basic housing units", which will need to meet a number of requirements such as a minimum size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citing public views received during a consultation exercise which concluded earlier, Ho said some respondents expressed the need for more time to make the changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said extending the grace period to three years could be an option.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Time-wise, it is helpful to the market - so tenants can move out and renovation work can take place and people have better options on where to live," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All these will help the situation. So I think a three-year grace period is something that can be considered."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho added that the government is analysing the public’s views and will make adjustments to the legal proposals accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the housing chief said officials will soon put in place a pilot scheme at two public housing estates by installing censors at the doors of flats occupied by elderly residents, in order to better ensure their safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme comes after a recent spate of cases involving elderly people who die alone in their homes for some time before being discovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said dozens of households at Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin and Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong have signed up for the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The censor records movements. The elderly person can decide who to send such information - it's not to the estate's management, it can be his or her son, daughter or other family members. It's up to the tenant," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister stressed the censors don't have cameras and won't detect what's inside the flat.

    Crowds flock to Ocean Park to meet panda cubs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park's panda twin cubs made their highly-anticipated public debut on Sunday in front of hundreds of delighted locals and tourists.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many visitors arrived extra early to make sure they could meet the baby pandas as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local panda enthusiast, surnamed Chan, told RTHK that he arrived at Ocean Park two hours before it opened - and he's also taking part in a contest to pick a name for the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I arrived here at 8am. I want to see them as soon as I can. I will join the [naming] contest, but I am still thinking [about what names to propose]. The theme will probably be related to Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists were equally thrilled to meet the locally-born cubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  One Indonesian student who’s currently studying in Shenzhen said he doesn’t get to see pandas in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We don’t really have access to pandas [in Indonesia]. So looking at pandas, especially the cubs, is quite special to us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park says visitors are allowed to stay for up to five minutes inside the venue to give more people a chance to view the panda babies.
  <br>
  <br>
  While some said they wish they could spend more time with the cubs, Christa from San Francisco said the arrangement is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They [panda cubs] are just doing their own thing, just hanging out. They don’t need to do anything special, they’re just special the way they are,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think if you can take what you can get so others could enjoy them too I think it’s better to have more people enjoy them and want to conserve and protect them. So I think it’s better to have more people see them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Public viewings of the panda cubs are from 10am to 3pm daily, and the facility is expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  People can also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman sunamed Ho said she may sign up for the session so that she can spend more time with the twins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the pandas climbing up and down. I like both of them. I think seeing the cubs grow up is like seeing my grandchildren. I am interested in the HK$1,500 session, at least I'll have half an hour to see the cubs. I think it's worth it because I feel happy after seeing them," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another woman surnamed Leung said the VIP slot is just too costly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will not consider [registering] at all. It is not necessary. I still have to see the pandas with another 50 people even after paying HK$1,500," she said.

<img alt='British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says London "will work to ensure we keep the US and Europe together". File photo: Reuters' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791827_1_20250216082626.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European leaders on Saturday mobilised to force their way to the table at any talks on the Ukraine war, as Washington announced a team of senior US officials was planning to meet in Saudi Arabia with counterparts from Moscow and Kiev.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump upended the status quo this week when he announced he was likely to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin soon to start talks to end the conflict, leaving US allies in Europe reeling from concerns that their interests would be sidelined in any deal on Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will head to Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks with Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, US officials said on Saturday, without giving details on when the meeting would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio had already been due to visit Saudi Arabia as part his first tour of the Middle East, which began on Saturday when he arrived in Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top US diplomat also had a call on Saturday with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, in which he "reaffirmed President Trump's commitment to finding an end to the conflict in Ukraine," spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Munich, Nato chief Mark Rutte said Europe had to come up with "good proposals" for securing peace in Ukraine if it wanted to be involved in US-led talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Europeans want to have a say, make yourself relevant," Rutte told journalists at a gathering of top policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rutte also said he would head to Paris on Monday to take part in a meeting of European leaders convened by French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gathering would focus on defence spending and planning so that "when a deal is reached in Ukraine, that we have absolute clarity what Europe can contribute," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Europe "must take on a greater role in Nato" and work with the United States to "secure Ukraine's future".
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Starmer said: "This is a once in a generation moment for our national security where we engage with the reality of the world today and the threat we face from Russi
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of any eventual "security guarantees" for Ukraine, talks have begun in Europe over a potential deployment of peacekeepers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those discussions are at an embryonic stage -- and others argue the focus needs to be on building up Ukraine's own forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the creation of a European army, arguing the continent could no longer count on Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it," Zelensky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created."
  <br>
  <br>
  The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelensky's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement," Zelensky said in a speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine. No decisions about Europe without Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, gave Europeans reasons to doubt they would be heard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe would not be directly involved in talks but would still have an "input", Kellogg said in Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have sought to assure Ukraine that it will not be left in the cold after three years of battling Russia's invasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said after his sit-down with Zelensky that the United States was looking for a "durable, lasting peace" that would not lead to further bloodshed in coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Washington has sent mixed messages to Kyiv, with Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth appearing to rule out Ukraine joining Nato or having all of its territoroy restoreD.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also pushed for access to Ukraine's stocks of rare earth minerals as compensation for the military aid provided by the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said ON Saturday he blocked a deal that would have given the US access to vast amounts of Ukrainian natural resources as it lacked "security guarantees" for Kyiv. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 14-year-old boy died, and five other people were injured in a knife attack in southern Austria on Saturday, police said, adding they have arrested a 23-year-old Syrian asylum seeker.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A man randomly attacked passersby with a knife," police spokesman Rainer Dionisio told AFP of the incident in the city of Villach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One victim, a 14-year-old boy, died," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two other men suffered serious injuries, while another two men were lightly injured, Dionisio added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened on Saturday just before 4pm local time (2300 HKT) in the centre of the city, the capital of Carinthia Province.
  <br>
  <br>
  A food delivery rider saw the attack and rammed his vehicle into the attacker, who was lightly injured and was arrested "right after the attack," according to Dionisio.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man under arrest is a Syrian asylum seeker with a valid residence permit and without a criminal record, according to preliminary information, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest victim was the 14-year-old, while the oldest is 32 years old, he said. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791825_1_20250216075612.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and Russian officials will meet in Saudi Arabia in the coming days to start talks aimed at ending Moscow's nearly three-year war in Ukraine, a US lawmaker and a source familiar with the planning said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who met with US Vice President JD Vance in Germany on Friday, said Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia and Kyiv would not engage with Russia before consulting with strategic partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz and White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Saudi Arabia, US Representative Michael McCaul told Reuters. It was not immediately clear who they would meet from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, McCaul said the aim of the talks was to arrange a meeting between US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy "to finally bring peace and end this conflict."
  <br>
  <br>
  A source with knowledge of the plans confirmed the planned talks in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Russian officials. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who took office on January 20, has repeatedly vowed to swiftly end the Ukraine war. He made separate phone calls to Putin and Zelenskiy on Wednesday, leaving Washington's European allies alarmed that they will be cut out of any peace process.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those fears were largely confirmed on Saturday when Trump's Ukraine envoy said Europe won't have a seat at the table, after Washington sent a questionnaire to European capitals to ask what they could contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday Rubio spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. They agreed on regular contacts to prepare for a meeting between Putin and Trump, Russia's Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelenskiy said on Friday he would visit the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, but did not say when. However, the Ukrainian leader said he had no plans to meet with US or Russian officials during those visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moscow controls a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly advancing in the east for months, while Kyiv's smaller army grapples with manpower shortages and tries to hold a chunk of territory in western Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has demanded Kyiv cede territory and become permanently neutral under any peace deal. Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured land and wants NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent attack by Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Europe have given Ukraine tens of billions of dollars in military aid since the war started. Trump has said he backs Ukraine but is seeking security for US funding for Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and Ukraine are currently negotiating a deal that could open up Ukraine's vast natural wealth to US investment. Three sources said the US proposed taking ownership of 50 percent of Ukraine's critical minerals. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the draft deal did not contain the security provisions Kyiv needed.

<img alt="A textbook header from Mikel Merino set the Gunners on their way. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791802_1_20250215223425.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal brushed off its shortage of specialist strikers on Saturday as midfielder Mikel Merino scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Leicester City that kept the north London club's Premier League title challenge on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merino's brace allowed second-placed Arsenal to cut Liverpool's advantage to four points although the leaders will be confident of replying against Wolverhampton Wanderers ,later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champions Manchester City's title hopes may have long since vanished but they looked much more recognisable as recent signing Omar Marmoush bagged a hat-trick in 13 first-half minutes in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win allowed City to climb into fourth place with 44 points, three points behind Nottingham Forest whose top-four ambitions suffered a dent in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth's challenge for the top four shows no sign of petering out as they won 3-1 at bottom club Southampton to move above Chelsea and Newcastle into fifth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  When German forward Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season this week, joining Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Sako on the injured list, Arsenal fans must have feared the worst.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta gave Raheem Sterling a place in his starting line-up at Leicester but the former Chelsea man had a torrid afternoon and was replaced by Merino after 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard's impact was decisive as he broke the deadlock in the 81st minute from an assist by impressive teenager Ethan Nwaneri and he wrapped up the points in the 87th minute after good work by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the game started to suit (Merino) more because they started to defend much deeper, and we had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. "We believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Arsenal stayed on Liverpool's heels, Leicester's plight is precarious. They are 19th with 17 points after losing nine of their last 10 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Marmoush had not scored for City since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt last month but he opened his account in explosive fashion against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Marmoush gave City the lead in the 19th minute with a lob after Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier misjudged goalkeeper Ederson's long delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five minutes later he latched on to a pass from Ilkay Gundogan to fire home and then completed his hat-trick with a thumping shot after good work by Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew sooner or later he would score goals, he is a good finisher. Of course he has to improve, but now we see how he handles the compliments," manager Pep Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only blemish for City was Erling Haaland being forced off with an injury.

  "I have not spoken to the doctor, but I was scared when he went down. Maybe it's not as bad as it could be," Guardiola said.

  Chris Wood scored his 18th league goal of the season for Forest but it could not prevent his side slipping to defeat at Fulham for whom Emile Smith Rowe opened the scoring and Calvin Bassey headed the winner.

  Bournemouth moved to fifth with 43 points, just one behind Manchester City, as goals by Dango Ouattara, Ryan Christie and Marcus Tavernier sealed the points in the south coast derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation battlers Ipswich Town secured a well-earned point in a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Axel Tuanzebe was dismissed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich still went ahead after the break when Liam Delap steered in Omari Hutchinson's low cross but Ollie Watkins equalised for Villa who dropped to ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich are in 18th place with 17 points, two behind 17th placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.

  Eleventh-placed Brentford beat West Ham United 1-0 away thanks to an early goal by Kevin Schade. They have now won three successive away games in the top flight for the first time ever. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK government on Saturday named two Britons detained in Iran as Craig and Lindsay Foreman, with their family saying they are determined to ensure the pair's "safe return."
 <br>
  <br>
  The two are currently being held in the city of Kerman, the family said in a statement issued by the British foreign ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family added that it was "united in our determination to secure their safe return."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We truly appreciate the outpouring of support from friends, family, and the community, which has provided us with strength and encouragement as we face this ordeal," said the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The couple are in their early 50s and were on a motorbike tour around the world when they were detained in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Foreign Office confirmed on Friday that it was "providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran" and was in contact with Iranian authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Iran's official news agency IRNA reported on Thursday that two British nationals were being held in central Kerman province for unspecified security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK government advises against all travel to Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are "at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention."
  <br>
  <br>
  Several other Europeans are held in custody in Iran, which has conducted multiple prisoner exchanges with Western governments in recent years. (AFP)

<img alt="German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pushed back against US Vice President JD Vance's broadside against Germany and the EU on Friday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791795_1_20250215201949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday said that Germany rejects "outsiders intervening in our democracy," a day after US Vice President JD Vance in a blistering speech told Europe to open the door to far-right parties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz, who faces elections on February 23, spoke in Munich where Vance on Friday launched his broadside against Germany and the EU on immigration, free speech and other topics in a speech later praised by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance also met Alice Weidel, the top candidate of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also received strong backing from technology billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Scholz pushed back against Vance's speech and defended Germany's taboo against cooperating with extremist parties, often dubbed a "firewall."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not accept outsiders intervening in our democracy, in our elections," Scholz said. "That is not appropriate – especially not among friends and allies."
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also defended European policies after Vance's speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Freedom of expression is guaranteed in Europe," Barrot said on X, after Vance alleged it was "in retreat." "Nobody is obliged to adopt our model, but nobody can impose theirs on us," the French minister added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz started his speech by mentioning Vance's earlier visit to the Nazis' Dachau concentration camp near Munich, and the US vice president's commitment to "never again" allow such crimes to be committed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Holocaust was the reason "the vast majority of Germans are firmly opposed to those who glorify or justify" the Nazis, Scholz said, recalling that AfD senior figures have trivialised Nazi crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A commitment to 'never again' cannot be reconciled with support for the AfD," Scholz said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later stressed that "we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should stay outside the political decision-making process and that there would be no cooperation with them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance had criticised Germany for excluding parties that voice strong concerns over immigration and argued that "democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no room for firewalls," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clash between the traditional allies comes just over a week before German national elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats are currently third in the polls at around 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is being led by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc, whose support stands at around 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AfD is expected to score its best-ever national result, now polling in second place at around 20 percent. (AFP)

    Zelensky calls for creation of European army

<img alt="Ukraine's president tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe needs its own army. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791790_1_20250215191907.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday Ukraine would never accept any peace deal reached behind its back or without Kyiv's involvement – an implicit message to US President Donald Trump as he strives to end the war with Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a speech to the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky also called on Europe to create its own armed forces, urging the continent's leaders to decide their own future and saying Ukraine's armed forces alone were not enough for their security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. And the same rule should apply to all of Europe," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky spoke after Trump held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, the first between US and Russian leaders since Russia's February 2022 full-scale assault on Ukraine, and said he and Putin expected to meet in the future, probably in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine has repeatedly said it wants to come together with the United States and Europe to devise a joint strategy before any Trump-Putin meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration so far has left the impression among some European allies that it was making concessions to Putin at Ukraine's expense before any negotiations begin, though remarks by some top US officials have raised confusion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky predicted that the Kremlin would try to persuade Trump to attend Russia's May 9 commemorations in Moscow, when it marks the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade through Red Square.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky told the conference that he believed it would be "dangerous" if Trump met Putin before he and Trump meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  To Europe's leaders, he issued warnings, asking rhetorically whether their armies would be ready if Moscow launched an open or "false-flag" attack. The latter is designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone other than the group responsible for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this (Ukraine-Russia) war ends the wrong way, he (Putin) will have a surplus of battle-tested soldiers who know nothing but killing and looting," he said, citing intelligence reports saying Russia will dispatch its troops to Belarus this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And now, as we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the Armed Forces of Europe." (Reuters)

    Tennis world number one Sinner gets 3-month doping ban

<img alt="Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner says he accepts responsibility for his team's mistakes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791789_1_20250215183106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis after the world number one admitted team mistakes led to him twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The February 9 to May 4 suspension means Sinner will be free to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sinner said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accepted that he "had no intent and did not derive any competitive advantage from the two positive tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Open champion Sinner has always said that clostebol entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis, I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wada said separately that "Sinner did not intend to cheat" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement between Sinner and Wada means that Sinner will be able to play in front of his home fans at the Rome Open which kicks off just after the end of his suspension and is the last big clay court tournament before Roland Garros. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU said on Saturday it was "urgently" considering all options in response to a widening rebel offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, after Rwandan-backed forces seized a second major city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having captured the key provincial capital of Goma last month, M23 fighters pushed south and took a vital airport before marching virtually unchecked into another key city, Bukavu, on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Alarmed by news of Rwandan backed M23 forces seizing Kavumu airport and entering Bukavu, ignoring international appeals for ceasefire," European Commission spokesman Anouar El Anouni wrote on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The EU urgently considers all the means at its disposal. The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The warning comes as the conflict is set to dominate an African Union summit that opened on Saturday in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa with UN chief Antonio Guterres saying a regional escalation "must be avoided at all costs".
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows an appeal from the European Parliament, which this week urged the EU to suspend a minerals deal with Rwanda in response to Kigali's involvement in the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers in Strasbourg on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution which also called for the bloc's 27 member states to freeze all direct budget support as well as military and security assistance to Rwanda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rwanda denies giving military support to the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in DR Congo of threatening its security.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report by UN experts said last year Kigali maintained around 4,000 troops in DR Congo and had de facto control of the rebel group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict has killed thousands and driven vast numbers from their homes. (AFP)

    Real-name ticketing deters scalpers: Consumer Council

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council has called on the government to implement real-name registration for tickets to prevent scalping.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TV program on Saturday, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said real-name ticketing can deter scalpers and allow people who are truly interested in attending to buy tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When more mega events are taking place, there will be more ticket scalping. Recently, it was reported in the news that a ticket had been marked-up to an astronomical price of more than HK$100,000,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the market can be regulated and stabilized. We believe that real-name ticketing is a good way to achieve that,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council received over 40,000 complaints last year, a 20 percent increase from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said over 7,000 complaints were related to Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match last February, as well as the abrupt closure of the Physical Fitness chain in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  She urged organisers to provide clearer clauses for future events, and to inform consumers earlier if they are any changes.

 A data interchange system among departments has not been set up due to privacy and technical issues, according Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, but the government is in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to overcome challenges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers had called on the authorities to provide more assistance to hidden elders, after a 78-year-old man was found dead inside his Tuen Mun flat earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an event on Saturday, Sun said the government should make use of data from departments like the Hospital Authority and the Social Welfare Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said authorities are currently in touch with the Privacy Commissioner to discuss ways allowing data interchange, while complying with the Personal Data Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope we can intervene before any incident occurs. We can identify some high-risk cases and contact them to provide services. We hope to avoid tragedies as much as possible," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chief Executive's Policy Address last year mentioned that officials would make use of identification tools designed by universities for detection of high-risk cases.

 Israeli hostages Iair Horn, Sagui Dekel-Chen and Sasha (Alexander) Troufanov arrived at a release site in Gaza on Saturday after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamas fighters led the three onto a stage at the site in Gaza's Khan Younis, live footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three have been returned in exchange for 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, a swap which eases fears that the agreement could collapse before the end of a 42-day ceasefire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamas had earlier threatened not to release more hostages after it accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire by blocking aid from entering Gaza, drawing counter-threats of a resumption of fighting from Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emaciated appearance of three hostages released last week and accounts of abuse by other hostages released since January 19 when the ceasefire took effect has set off Israeli protests demanding that the government stick to the ceasefire and proceed with the next stage of the deal to bring all the hostages home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prospects for the ceasefire surviving have also been clouded by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved permanently out of Gaza, and for the enclave to be turned over to the United States to be redeveloped. That call was strongly rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Western allies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce was intended to open the way for a second phase of negotiations to return remaining hostages and complete the withdrawal of Israeli forces before a final end to the war and the rebuilding of Gaza, which now lies largely in ruins, facing shortages of food, running water and electricity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hamas threat to hold off from releasing more hostages followed its accusation that Israel had blocked tents and temporary shelter materials from entering into Gaza, leaving tens of thousands exposed to the winter cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel rejected the accusation, saying it had allowed thousands of aid trucks in. Hamas on Saturday said it expects Israel to meet its aid obligations for the ceasefire to stay on track. (Reuters)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<img alt="OpenAI's board said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to purchase the company. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791762_1_20250215151723.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

    CE invites public to name panda twins

<div class="itemFullText">
 People are invited to suggest names for Ocean Park's panda twin cubs as they turn six months old on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the greeting ceremony for the panda babies, Chief Executive John Lee said people can submit their ideas, based on the twins' appearance and personality, from noon on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government will announce their names in the first half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that Sunday will be a big day, as the cubs will finally meet the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that pandas have been born in the SAR, and there's a sense of elation among Hong Kong people. The pair only weighed about 120 grammes each when they were born, and they've shown extraordinary resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After six months, their weight has increased to over ten kilogrammes each. They were a bit shaky at first, but now, they've become experts at tree climbing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park said people can suggest a Chinese name for each of the cubs, along with an explainer of the meaning of the Chinese names.
  <br>
  <br>
  The submission deadline is March 7, and the judging panel will comprise representatives from the park, the SAR government, and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park's chairman Paulo Pong said with the support of the whole community, the SAR has successfully promoted the concept of "panda is everywhere".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With promotions through social media, on transportation and various creative activities across Hong Kong involving panda-themed products, we connected Hong Kong and global panda lovers. This further promotes Hong Kong's tourism and culture," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that the park will use top-tier animal care, veterinary and scientific research to help with the breeding of giant pandas.

    Public urged to be alert to new SMS scam messages

 Police said efforts to educate the elderly have led to a significant drop in the number of so-called “Guess Who” phone scams – in which fraudsters pose as an old friend or relative of the victim.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of “Guess Who” phone scams, which mainly targets victims aged 65 or above, were down by 48 percent last year, police commissioner Raymond Siu said on Saturday after attending a Commercial Radio program.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s why last year, we particularly focused our effort to deliver these anti-scam messages to the elderly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu said police are working with The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) to combat other types of telephone scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes following reports of suspected scam text messages carrying the hashtag prefix, to trick victims into thinking that they were sent by the authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December 2023, the authority launched a short message service (SMS) sender registration scheme, in which companies and organizations participating send text messages under their registered IDs with the prefix “#”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to tackle other telephone scams, we need to find out the reasons as well as the victimised group, so as to work with all stakeholders, in particular the telecommunications industry and also the OFCA,” Siu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We set up a specific working group back in September 2022. We continue to hold regular meetings with them, in order to come up with different measures to tackle this sort of telephone scam,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu reminded residents to remain alert to potential scam messages, especially those with hyperlinks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand said they arrested 10 Chinese nationals in connection with the case involving Chinese actor Wang Xing and have handed them over to the immigration department for repatriation to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement released by the Thai police, investigations found that the 10 arrested belonged to a criminal gang that had long been conducting telecommunications fraud targeting Chinese citizens in Myawaddy, Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were accused of pretending to be employees of an entertainment company in Thailand to defraud Wang Xing. After Wang's rescue, they attempted to flee to Cambodia via Thailand, but were arrested in various locations near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thatchai Pitaneelaboot, senior inspector general of the Thai police, said he's instructed for the 10 suspects to be handed over to the Thai Immigration Bureau for repatriation to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Xing, a Chinese actor, entered Thailand on January 3 but lost contact near the Thailand-Myanmar border. Thai police tracked his movements and successfully carried out a rescue operation, identifying Wang as a victim of human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand said Wang has since returned to China following joint efforts from both countries. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The construction industry should look into limiting the use of bamboo scaffolding if the situation calls for it, according to Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  A scaffolding collapse at a Kai Tak construction site last month injured 11 workers, sparking discussions about replacing bamboo altogether with metal scaffolding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Siu said the industry should explore the possibility to limit the use of bamboo and find the most suitable material for each construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bamboo is very special material and it's widely used in Hong Kong, but in other places, they don't use bamboo. That means there may be some shortcomings of this material," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we need to do more research on why some Hong Kong construction companies like to use metal material instead of bamboo."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, Chau Sze-kit, told the same programme that it is impossible to completely scrap the use of bamboo scaffold immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggested the industry should instead look into ways of implementing safety mechanisms when using either bamboo or metal scaffold.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China's policy toward the United States is consistent and stable, but if the US persists in suppressing China, China will have no choice but to "play along to the end."
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Wang said China would respond resolutely to unilateral "bullying" practices but hopes the US can work together with it in the same direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism offers no way out, and arbitrary tariffs produce no winners." Wang emphasised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the foreign minister said China advocated peaceful talks to resolve regional issues and believes all parties and stakeholders should participate.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that Europe should play an important role in the process of addressing the crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang highlights the cooperative relationship between China and Europe and that Beijing sees Europe as an "important pole" in a multi-polar world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe are partners, not rivals."

  Israel and Hamas have traded accusations of violating the January 19 ceasefire, with the Palestinian group saying it would pause releases and Israel threatening the resumption of war in the Gaza Strip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday both sides signalled that the hostage release scheduled for Saturday would go ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said that Israel was to release 369 inmates in exchange, with 24 of them expected to be deported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority, 333 people, are "prisoners from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after October 7", the group said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the crisis that appeared to bring the fragile truce to a breaking point, Hamas said on Friday it expected talks on a second phase of the ceasefire to begin early next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose country is Israel's top backer and has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, is due to arrive in Israel late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week's release sparked anger in Israel and beyond, with the emaciated state of the freed Israeli hostages sparking concern over conditions in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also fears for Palestinians in Israeli custody after some prisoners required medical treatment on their release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ceasefire has been under massive strain since US President Donald Trump proposed a takeover of the Gaza Strip under which the territory's population of more than two million would be moved to Egypt or Jordan.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the "Nakba", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of their ancestors during Israel's creation in 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arab countries have come together to reject the plan, and Saudi Arabia will host the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday for a summit on the issue. (AFP)

    Trump signals auto tariffs to come in April

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a central plank of presidential campaign last year. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791730_1_20250215093857.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Trump said on Friday that he planned to unveil tariffs on imported cars around April 2, adding to a cascade of levies he has threatened since taking office.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's statement did not specify whether the tariffs would apply to all auto imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump has taken aim at allies and adversaries alike with threats of fresh duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has referred to tariffs as a way to raise revenue, remedy trade imbalances and pressure countries to act on US concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experts have warned that the tariffs will be passed on to American consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked when he might unveil auto tariffs, Trump said, "Maybe around April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not provide further details on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of the cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada and the other half from other major auto-producing countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latter group is led by Japan, South Korea and Germany, with Britain, Italy and Sweden a source of a smaller volume of imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent days, Ford CEO Jim Farley has blasted a proposed Trump tariff of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada, noting that it disadvantages US companies that have integrated their supply chains across North America under trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in the first Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 3, the White House suspended the tariffs for 30 days following moves from Canada and Mexico on border security and fentanyl policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Levies targeting the auto sector would come after the president recently firmed up plans for tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has previously promised tariffs on semiconductors, steel, oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, in a move broadening trade conflicts, Trump launched plans for "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit all US trading partners on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, has called for Trump to drop proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We support President Trump's efforts to consider the entire global trade situation, including both tariff and non-tariff barriers," said AAPC President Matt Blunt on Thursday in response to the announcement on reciprocal tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the meantime, Ford, GM, and Stellantis continue to believe that vehicles and auto parts that meet the USMCA requirements should not be subject to additional tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AAPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. (AFP)

    Under-fire Guardiola mocks Liverpool

<img alt="Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola says Liverpool's point tally falls short of the champions' record. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791728_1_20250215090255.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola has taunted Premier League leaders Liverpool over their failure to match Manchester City's record 100-point tally.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's troubled side are trailing 16 points behind Liverpool after their bid for a fifth successive English crown collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal as they chase a 20th title, which would equal Manchester United's record.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if Arne Slot's men go on to secure the trophy, they now cannot match the record points total set when City won the first of Guardiola's six titles in 2017-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of City's faltering performance after Tuesday's 3-2 home defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off round first leg, Guardiola took a swipe at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We took all the records in England. Who would do 100 points now in modern football? I'm waiting," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or four in a row? I'm waiting - with clubs like Bournemouth, Fulham and Wolves that you have to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The standards, we dictated. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already - 99 but not 100."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Liverpool may not surpass fifth-placed City's record mark, Guardiola accepts his team have fallen behind their rivals this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I asked 'Gundo' (Ilkay Gundogan) yesterday, 'two years ago you were here, you were one year in Barcelona and you come back here, did you see changes in the Premier League?'," said Guardiola, whose team host top four rivals Newcastle on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He said massively, the difference was unbelievable. It's the truth. The teams are much, much, much better in all departments. People prepare so well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot do it for the (injury) problems we've had. There are a lot of players, with the amount of minutes they have had, who are so tired, emotionally as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But guys, we deserve to have a bad season. We deserve not to be like we were. They are human beings, it can happen. We weren't consistent and we haven't had the players at their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that me and many of the players have lived this position but we have to accept it (and recognise) what happened in the past was not normal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola believes the difference from previous successful seasons is that City are no longer making the most of their dominance of possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept when the opponents have the ball, I'm going to suffer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now we are suffering when we have the ball. It never happened before and, (right) now, I cannot change it. We are suffering because we are human beings." (AFP)

    Vance, Zelensky meet for talks to end war

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance pledged on Friday that Washington sought to secure a "lasting" peace as he held a first meeting with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss Donald Trump's push for a deal with Moscow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Munich were seen as a key moment for Kyiv as it tried to keep Washington on its side after Trump stunned allies by announcing peace efforts with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple of years down the road," Vance said as the meeting wrapped up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said "good conversations" had been had with Zelensky about how they could reach that goal, and they would have more talks "in the days, weeks, and months to come.".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky also hailed a "good conversation," saying the encounter with Vance was "our first meeting, not last, I'm sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to move as quickly as possible towards a real and guaranteed peace," Zelensky wrote later on X, adding that an envoy from Washington would visit Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump rattled Ukraine and its European allies on Wednesday by agreeing to launch peace talks in his first publicly announced call with Putin since returning to office.
  <br>
  <br>
  After nearly three years of war of frosty relations, the dramatic thaw in US-Russia relations sparked fears that Ukraine could be left behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials have insisted that Zelensky will be involved in negotiations—and the Ukrainian leader said he would be prepared to sit down with Putin after agreeing to a "common plan" with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only in this case I'm ready to meet," Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference before seeing Vance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance said ahead of the meeting that the United States was prepared to pressure Russia, adding that Europe should "of course" be at the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also told Europe to "step up" on bolstering its own defence to allow Washington to focus on threats elsewhere in the world. (AFP)

    US markets close mixed on tariff news, retail data

<img alt="Wall Street closed mixed, with the S&P 500 barely changed, but the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791725_1_20250215072352.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq Composite on Friday, but other major indices were either down or barely changed as investors digested President Trump's latest tariff announcement, economic data and earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 percent at 44,546.08, the S&P 500 was flat, finishing at 6,114.63 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 percent to 20,026.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest official figures showed that US retail sales fell by a more-than-expected 0.9 percent in January from December, but analysts noted that this partly reflected an upward revision to the December figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop was also partly due to bad weather that depressed demand, and could also show "a little consumer fatigue," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors largely shrugged off data earlier this week showing an increase in consumer price inflation and higher-than-expected wholesale price inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stock market continues to maintain this resilient disposition," said O'Hare, who pointed to strong corporate earnings as an offset to concerns about tariffs and an uptick in inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a rebound in inflation, or persistent inflation at a high level, would make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets also continued to follow the latest trade developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union on Friday vowed to respond "firmly and immediately" to trade barriers after Trump unveiled tariffs that could hit US allies and competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war he has unleashed since taking office in January, but the measures will not go into effect until a study is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising trade tensions, investor sentiment has largely held up in the hope that many of the tariffs can be rowed back with negotiations, while Trump's announcement of plans to hold Ukraine peace talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has added some optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff ambiguity still reigns but markets are currently drawing some comfort from the news" of the delay, said National Australia Bank's head of currencies research and markets, Ray Attrill. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2025 Asian Winter Games concluded on Friday in Harbin, marking an historic achievement for the Hong Kong, China delegation, as they delivered their best-ever performance in the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Timothy Fok, first vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, declared the 9th Asian Winter Games closed at the Harbin International Conference, Exhibition and Sports Centre, where he also highlighted the record-breaking participation at the Games, with over 1,200 athletes from 34 countries and regions — the highest turnout in the event's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is truly a unique and charming part of China and the world - not only for the beauty of the city and the landscape but also for the warmth and friendliness of the local people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The closing ceremony was a vibrant celebration filled with song and dance, followed by participating delegations and athletes entering the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curler Martin Yan carried the flag for Hong Kong, China, while Chinese skier Xu Mengtao served as the flag bearer for the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, vice president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and chef de mission for the SAR delegation, said the team achieved significant breakthroughs despite winter sports being relatively uncommon in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has been gaining prominence on the world stage in winter sports. With the valuable experience gained by competing with top players in the Games, our athletes will make significant progress in their levels," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am hopeful that more young winter sports enthusiasts will join the team, contributing to a sustainable and promising development in the city’s ice and snow sports. Our winter athletes will continue to excel on global stage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China made its debut in curling and alpine skiing at these Games, with the men's curling team placing fourth and an alpine skier achieving a record 10th place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's ice hockey team also reached the quarterfinals for the first time, while athletes in short track speed skating and figure skating ranked in the top 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trojena, Saudi Arabia, is set to host the 10th Asian Winter Games in 2029, marking the first time the event will be held in West Asia. (Additional reporting from Xinhua)

    Drone damages outer shell of Chernobyl nuclear plant

<img alt="Ukraine said that a Russian drone had struck a cover built to contain radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791695_1_20250214213154.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A drone armed with a warhead hit the outer protective shell of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant on Friday, damaging the structure and briefly starting a fire, in an attack Kyiv blamed on Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin denied it was responsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radiation levels at the shuttered plant in the Kyiv region — site of the world's worst nuclear accident — have not increased, according to the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency, which said the strike did not breach the plant's inner containment shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IAEA did not attribute blame, saying only that its team stationed at the site heard an explosion and was informed that a drone had struck the shell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fighting around nuclear power plants has repeatedly raised fears of a nuclear catastrophe during three years of war, particularly in a country where many vividly remember living through the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which killed at least 30 people and spewed radioactive fallout over much of the Northern Hemisphere.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is Europe’s biggest, has occasionally been hit by drones during the war without causing significant damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike came two days after US President Donald Trump upended American policy on Ukraine, saying he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ending the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move seemed to identify Putin as the only player that matters and looked set to sideline Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as European governments, in any peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the plant's outer shell and started a fire, which had been put out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shell was built in 2016 over another heavy concrete containment structure, which was placed on the plant’s fourth reactor soon after the 1986 disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both shells seek to prevent radiation leaks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told his Macau counterpart the two SARs are "as close as brothers" with solid economic and trade relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said, during the exchange with Macau Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai on Friday, that the two cities could enjoy the fruits of economic development by taking part in the development of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lee said that the two cities are as close as brothers, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations. He noted that the One Country, Two Systems principle is a good policy for maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau," a government statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He also noted that Hong Kong and Macau, both of which are core cities of the [Greater Bay Area], can achieve complementarity and participate in and promote the development of the [Greater Bay Area] together, benefiting the people of both cities with the fruits of economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Sam's first visit to Hong Kong since becoming Macau's leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate social media post, the chief executive expressed hope the two cities would cooperate further under the leadership of Sam to carry out the four expectations laid out by President Xi Jinping in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December last year, Xi directed Macau to diversify its economy, improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China's international connections, and safeguard social harmony and stability.

    Japan to release emergency rice reserves

<img alt="A five-kilo bag was selling for 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese government on Friday said it would release a fifth of its emergency rice stockpile after hot weather, poor harvests and panic buying over a "megaquake" warning nearly doubled prices over a year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan has previously tapped into its reserves to cope with disasters, but this marked the first time since the stockpile was built in 1995 that it was doing so because of supply chain problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some supermarket shelves were emptied in August of rice following a week-long holiday, a series of typhoons and warnings of a looming major earthquake that has so far failed to materialise.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had initially hoped prices would stabilise late last year once newly harvested rice arrived in stores, but inflation continued unabated, this time because some distributors were hoarding for fear of running out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Agriculture Minister Taku Eto told reporters on Friday the government would release 210,000 tonnes of rice from its stock of one million tonnes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope you will take this as our strong determination to improve at all costs the situation where distribution has been delayed and stuck," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice prices had already began to change consumption patterns for some like Tokyo resident Eriko Kato.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still do buy rice occasionally, but since it's so expensive I sometimes give up on buying it once I see the price," Kato, 41, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A five-kilogramme bag was retailing at 3,688 yen (US$24) in the last week of January, according to a government survey, up from 2,023 yen last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice consumption in Japan has more than halved in the past 60 years to about 50.9 kilos in 2022, but the grain remains deeply ingrained in Japanese culture and its harvesting has shaped the nation's landscape -- even being used in Shinto rituals. (AFP)

<img alt="Liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong says mainland firms should support the SAR in integrating into national development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791680_1_20250214190054.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Beijing official on Friday called on mainland enterprises to take part in the Northern Metropolis project as part of efforts to fully back the Hong Kong government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of the central government's liaison office, told a reception that state-owned companies should also support the SAR in integrating into the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope state-owned enterprises will make good use of Hong Kong's unique advantages of having the backing of the motherland and being connected to the rest of the world," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mainland companies should continue to boost their investment in Hong Kong, and constantly improve their business strategies. They should also proactively take part in the Northern Metropolis development, fully support Hong Kong in consolidating its status as a financial, shipping, and trade centre, and in building an international innovation and technology centre."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also urged companies to take root in Hong Kong and contribute to society.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, Chief Executive John Lee described contributions to the Northern Metropolis development as "an investment with good returns" as he called on mainland firms to support the project.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, located within the metropolis area, is an important platform for collaboration in the Greater Bay Area, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will be innovative and use creative thinking to combine market forces, to promote the development of the Northern Metropolis, including that of the co-operation zone, so as to allow the first batch of industries to enter the region as soon as possible," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance will lead America's delegation to the Munich Security Conference that starts on Friday in the southern German city, where world leaders and diplomats are gathering amid intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The future of Ukraine will be the top item on the agenda following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the three-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict .
  <br>
  <br>
  Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for talks that many — particularly in Europe — hope will shed at least some light on Trump’s ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join them but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Department said he would take a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting with Zelensky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who upended years of steadfast US support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions — other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Ukraine war has to end,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “Young people are being killed at levels that nobody’s seen since World War II. And it’s a ridiculous war.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russia-Ukraine war is the biggest conflict on the European continent since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi will also be in Munich to communicate Beijing's position on global security.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, state media cited Wang as saying China welcomes all efforts committed to peace talks and supports building a "balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture." (Agencies)

    Govt backs CUHK Medical Centre loan extension bid

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has backed a request by CUHK Medical Centre to extend a loan repayment period, saying it doesn't want to end up having to take back the hospital's site due to a default.
 <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, legislators agreed to a two-year extension to repayments of a HK$4 billion government loan, in view of financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The medical centre is now seeking another extension, of three years, saying it expects to make losses in the current financial year as well as in the next one, and its cash balance is insufficient to cover the repayments at present.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco panel meeting on Friday, some lawmakers expressed concern that by 2028, the Chinese University would still be struggling to pay off the loan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What will the hospital do to tackle such a big funding gap? I'm sure no one wants the hospital to come back to Legco for another repayment extension after three years," said DAB lawmaker Chan Wing-kwong, with the party's Starry Lee echoing his concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the university's council, John Chai, told legislators that the medical centre will cut costs and find ways to boost revenue, for example by introducing more in-patient beds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a pocket of measures, including strengthening the business model through governance, through better management of the operations, looking into means of increasing avenues of revenue, looking into resource efficiency," Chai said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said if Legco doesn't approve the new extension before the middle of next month, CUHK will have to start repaying a first instalment of over HK$550 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the medical centre fails to repay the loan, it is clearly stipulated in the contract that there will be an additional interest rate of three percent per annum," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it still fails to repay the loan in the worst case scenario, the government will take back the medical centre, including the site and all the buildings or structures. We don't want to see this situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The extension request will be submitted to Legco's Finance Committee for further discussion.

 Six people were killed and more than two dozen were injured when a blaze ripped through a hotel construction site in the South Korean port city of Busan on Friday, the National Fire Agency said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire started just before 11am local time at the construction site of the Banyan Tree Hotel, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 workers were present when the blaze erupted, a National Fire Agency official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-five people were injured, a public health department official said, adding that most were minor injuries caused by smoke inhalation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fire had already reached its peak by the time we arrived and thick black smoke was covering the scene," Busan Gijang Fire Station chief Hong Mun-sik told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were many flammable materials blocking the entrance," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire broke out on the first floor of the building where workers had stored insulation materials, Hong said, and the fatalities occurred where the fire started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The exact cause and location of the fire need to be thoroughly investigated," Hong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fire was brought under control around 1.30pm. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of a pop-culture festival in the city on Friday said they were offering a refund to people who bought faulty priority tickets this week for the event next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mishap had to do with the popular K-pop girl group, NJZ, formerly known as New Jeans, who will be performing on March 23, the last day of the three-day festival.
  <br>
  <br>
  But fans were left disappointed when the tickets they bought through Cityline had the wrong date printed.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it was now refunding ticket holders who filed complaints with the Consumer Council, or made formal enquiries with ComplexCon or Cityline on or before Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To apply for the refund, please send the valid ticket and the confirmation email from Cityline, using the e-mail account you used to purchase the tickets, to ticketing_support_0210@complexconhk.com by 5pm Hong Kong time on [Sunday]," it said in a statement posted on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said the refund would not include handling fees charged by Cityline, and they were working with the platform on more details as to when the payment would go through.
  <br>
  <br>
  ComplexCon Hong Kong said it reserves the right to have the final say if there are any objections and disputes over the refund arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Consumer Council said it had received more than 50 complaints over the matter, involving some HK$220,000.

    'More schools should join free HPV jabs scheme'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers are calling for more secondary schools to get involved in the government's HPV vaccine catch-up programme, saying the current participation rate was not ideal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Health has purchased 180,000 HPV jabs for 52,000 female students to take two doses for free.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only 3,700 students were inoculated as 34 percent of schools have refused or have yet to sign up to the scheme that was rolled out last year, blaming manpower problems or scheduling issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr David Lam from the medical sector said two doses of the HPV vaccine could offer lifelong protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 9-valent HPV vaccine that we have right now can cover most of the viruses causing cervical cancer. It can prevent the infection caused by these viruses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means it has very wide coverage. Apart from this, it's also very safe. Medical evidence has shown that its effectiveness can reach 90 percent or more."
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that side effects, such as headaches and nausea, are mild.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elizabeth Quat from the DAB urged the government to step up promotion of the vaccine, saying that many parents were unaware of the free programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  It costs at least HK$3,000 for two HPV jabs in the private sector, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of cervical cancer cases in Hong Kong has surged by almost 30 percent in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, the disease was the ninth deadliest cancer in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arrangements were being made by the Macau authorities – via the Red Cross – to return to the SAR the bodies of two residents killed in an explosion in Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair were among seven members of a family from Macau caught up in the blast that rocked the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspected gas explosion hit the food court on the 12th floor of the building, killing four and injuring about 30 others.
  <br>
  <br>
  A team of officials from Macau went to Taichung and visited those injured in hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  China on Friday expressed condolences to the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, also extended sympathy to those injured in the blast. (Agencies)

    Tragedy prompts calls for database of at-risk families

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government should set up a database of at-risk elderly people, a lawmaker said on Friday, a day after a man in his 70s was found dead with his son unharmed beside him.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police were alerted on Thursday when security personnel detected a foul odour coming from a flat at Butterfly Estate in Tuen Mun.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said officers discovered the body of the 78-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  His 44-year-old son, who is reportedly mentally challenged, was next to the elder.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, lawmaker Bill Tang said authorities should consolidate the data they have about the city's senior citizens, noting that government units like the Social Welfare Department and the Hospital Authority hold the majority of information about these individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government can and has to integrate such database and form a high-risk elderly and family database, and facilitate the different kinds of social service organisations and community organisations... to care [for] and reach such kind of high-risk families," Tang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  One way to check up on such households would be to install sensors on devices around the flat, Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the sensor would be triggered and send an alert if the home's gate, for example, has not been touched for 48 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow legislator Stanley Li said the tragedy highlighted the need to shore up support for carers, adding the administration should offer more training for people to become caretakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department expressed concern about the incident, saying it has arranged for social workers to contact the family and provide assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is understood the family involved was not a case under the department.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exhibition activities fully returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with the number of visitors to the Convention and Exhibition Centre topping eight million, up 35 percent year-on-year, according to the centre's operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monica Lee-Müller, managing director at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited, said the centre hosted 812 events in 2024, including 100 international exhibitions and conferences.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said it will host more large-scale finance and technology-related events this year to assist with the SAR's fintech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  This includes Consensus Hong Kong 2025 on February 18-20, when more than 8,000 bitcoin, blockchain and Web3 professionals are expected to gather and discuss industry trends, before another conference in August specifically featuring bitcoins.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the hospitality sector veteran said the centre has been rolling out more measures, such as setting up Muslim-friendly facilities, to cater to the demands of diverse international visitors, especially those from the Middle East and Asean members.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the highlights of last year, she said, was the beauty event Cosmopack Asia 2024, when 74 percent of over 60,000 participants were from overseas, and the number of Middle East exhibitors rose 40 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visitors for consumption-related events also rose to a new record over the past 12 months, with sales during Pet Show 2025 last week exceeding HK$100 million, the highest among such events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee-Müller said the centre will innovate and host a new event, International Food Tasting Festival 2025, in April to further boost consumption, adding that over 600 exhibitors have already signed up.

    Tougher jail terms introduced for space oil offences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Friday added four substances to its list of dangerous drugs, a move which significantly increases the maximum punishments for people caught consuming, possessing, trafficking or manufacturing space oil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Users and those found with the space oil drug now risk prison terms of up to seven years and a fine as high as HK$1 million, while manufacturers or traffickers of any of the substances involved – etomidate, metomidate, propoxate and isopropoxate – can be jailed for life and hit with HK$5 million in fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously, the maximum prison term for space oil, under prescription drug regulations, was two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commissioner for Narcotics Kesson Lee said the tougher penalties will be a bigger deterrent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By listing the substances as dangerous drugs, we give greater powers to law enforcement agencies," Lee said on an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Officers can seize the proceeds of drug traffickers after applying to the courts. And if the traffickers had used young people for trafficking, we can also demand the court to pass heavier sentences."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Community Drug Advisory Council said the increased penalties are helpful, but they won't completely stop people from supplying or using space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will still be people taking risks for drug trafficking, and some will continue taking the drug," the council's executive director, David Ng, said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After all, space oil has been popular among young people for over two years in Hong Kong. Right now, we can say the drug has taken root here. Information on how to buy and consume it is all over many circles among youngsters."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng called for different levels of intervention with young people, including new measures targeting those who smoke e-cigarettes, as these can be used to take the drug.

    Baidu to make latest Ernie AI model open-source

<img alt="Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791606_1_20250214121337.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Search engine giant Baidu said on Friday it would make its next-generation artificial intelligence model Ernie open-source from June 30, a major shift in strategy as competition heats up.
 <br>
  <br>
  Baidu CEO Robin Li had long advocated for closed-source models as the only viable path for AI development, but the advent of DeepSeek has upended the sector. The startup offers open-source AI services that it claims are comparable in performance to US pioneer OpenAI's advanced systems but come with a lower operational cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keen to increase market share, Baidu also announced on Thursday that it would make its AI chatbot Ernie Bot free starting April 1, about a year and a half after introducing premium versions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, its Ernie large language model has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Baidu has said its current version, Ernie 4.0, matches OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance's Doubao chatbot has the most active monthly users on the mainland with 78.6 million, DeepSeek has 33.7 million while Ernie Bot has 13 million, according to January data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will gradually launch the Ernie 4.5 series in the coming months and officially open-source it from June 30," Baidu said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li appeared to have changed tack on open-source development, telling attendees at an event in Dubai this week that it could accelerate AI adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you open things up, a lot of people will be curious enough to try it. This will help spread the technology much faster," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu also plans to launch a new next-generation model, Ernie 5, in the second half of 2025, a person familiar with the matter has said. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong, China's men's curlers on Friday fell short of a podium finish at the Asian Winter Games, as the national team secured their 25th bronze and 83rd medal overall in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team China were dominant from the onset, jumping out to a 3-0 advantage over the SAR squad before entering the second end of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap managed to put two points on the board through the fourth end, but the national team cruised to hold a comfortable 5-2 lead entering the fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team China went on to secure another five before eventually sealing a 10-3 victory.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump inked plans on Thursday for sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" that could hit both allies and competitors, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, telling reporters that US allies were often "worse than our enemies" on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I’ve decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff," Trump said at the proclamation signing. “It’s fair to all. No other country can complain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them," Trump added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, he called the European Union "absolutely brutal" in trade ties with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the memo Trump signed on Thursday, officials - including the US trade representative and commerce secretary - will propose remedies on a country-by-country basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick said that studies should be completed by April 1, and the president could start tariffs as early as April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the EU, the White House also flagged differences in certain US tariff levels with India and Brazil, while noting Japan's "high structural barriers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists caution that sweeping tariffs on US imports would likely boost inflation, not reduce it, in the near term and could weigh on growth eventually.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged on Thursday that US prices "could go up" due to tariffs, but he expressed confidence that they would ultimately ease. (Agencies)

    Modi, Trump agree to trade talks

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine," but nonetheless warned that India won't be spared from higher tariffs he's begun imposing on US trade partners around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi's country “very unfair and strong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.”
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the US erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing US energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US and India have a trade deficit of US$50 billion in India’s favour. Goods and services trade between the two countries totalled around US$190.1 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, US exports to India were worth nearly US$70 billion, and imports US$120 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, the fourth world leader to visit the White House since Trump's return, described him as a friend and told him he was adopting a take on his "Make America Great Again" slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining Trump's meeting with Modi was SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. Modi also met one-on-one with Musk, raising questions over whether the world's richest man was meeting the Indian leader in an official or business capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian premier posted pictures of himself shaking hands with the beaming Musk, with several children on Musk's side of the room, and Indian officials on the other.
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, a prolific user of Musk-owned social media platform X, said later that he had known Musk before he became prime minister. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defence budgets in half.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hoped to gain commitments from Russia and China to cut their own spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s no reason for us to be building brand new nuclear weapons, we already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully much more productive," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.” (Agencies)

    Vaccine critic RFK Jr sworn in as US health secretary

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine critic who has pledged to tackle chronic disease, was named US Health Secretary on Thursday after overcoming resistance from the medical establishment and members of Congress with promises to limit his role in vaccination policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  As Kennedy was sworn into the post, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to "Make America Healthy Again," that would investigate chronic illness and deliver an action plan to fight childhood diseases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy said on Thursday his first priorities would be around "radical transparency" and removing those in the government who had conflicts of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 20 years, I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed that God would put me in a position where I could end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this country. On August 23 of last year, God sent me President Trump," Kennedy said, referring to when he dropped his independent presidential bid and endorsed the Republican candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Senate earlier on Thursday voted to confirm Kennedy 52-48, with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the lone Republican joining all 47 Democrats to vote against Kennedy, who had made pledges to protect existing vaccination programmes in a bid to secure votes of hesitant lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy will now oversee multiple high-profile agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kennedy, 71, is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will now run the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that directs more than US$3 trillion in healthcare spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also under HHS purview are the Medicare and Medicaid programmes that provide health insurance for over 140 million Americans and the National Institutes of Health.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to pledging to work to end chronic disease, Kennedy has said he wants to break any ties between employees at the US drugs regulator and industry. (Reuters)

    Foreign Minister Wang Yi in UK for talks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Britain need to strengthen strategic communication, enhance mutual trust and demonstrate responsibility as major countries, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a meeting with the UK prime minister on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang is visiting London for a strategic dialogue with the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, at which both sides agreed to speed up preparations for institutional dialogues on the economy and trade, health and industrial cooperation, the Foreign Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lammy hosted talks with Wang as the pair revived the China-UK Strategic Dialogue, a bilateral forum that was last held in 2018 before it stalled as relations soured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "dropped in" to a meeting between Wang and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer "underlined his intention to build a consistent and respectful relationship between the UK and China" and "reiterated that the UK will always engage frankly on the areas where our views differ," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides exchanged in-depth views on the Ukraine crisis, with Wang stressing "no expansion of the battlefields, no escalation of hostilities, and no fanning flames."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said China welcomed efforts committed to peace talks and supported the building of a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour government, elected in July, has sought to improve the UK's relationship with Beijing after the two countries fell out during the latter years of Conservative rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major thawing of tensions, Starmer and President Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit last November - the first bilateral meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance minister Rachel Reeves then visited China last month seeking investment to kickstart growth in Britain's economy, while Lammy visited Beijing in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A huge humpback whale briefly scooped a kayaker in its mouth in the seas off the coast of southern Chile before spitting him out unscathed in a dramatic incident caught on camera.
 <br>
  <br>
  The kayaker, Adrian Simancas, was out with his father last weekend in the seas off the town of Punta Arenas, when the whale surfaced and scooped him up in his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt like I was being lifted, but it was clearly too strong to be a wave," said Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I turned, I felt something blue and white passing close to my face, like on one side and above. I didn't understand what was happening. Then everything... I went under and thought I had been swallowed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Luckily, the whale quickly spat out Simancas unharmed. His father, in another kayak, caught the whole thing on camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I turned on the camera and heard a wave crash behind me, loudly. When I turned, I didn't see anything," said his father, Dell Simancas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that was the only moment of real fear because I didn't see Adrian for about three seconds. Then he suddenly shot out without the packraft, and a second later, the packraft emerged, and then I saw the fin of something."
  <br>
  <br>
  Adrian Simancas was sure he was going to die during the ordeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I was done for, that I was dead. It was like three strange seconds down there," he said. (Reuters)

 Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won 3-0 at home to Anderlecht in the first leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off tie, while Real Sociedad triumphed 2-1 away to Midtjylland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Premier League duo Dusan Tadic and Edin Dzeko scored in the first half for Fenerbahce before Morocco international Youssef En-Nesyri headed in a third for the Turkish side to give them full control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho won the competition with Porto in 2003 and again with Manchester United in 2017, also reaching the final when he was in charge of Roma two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad will return to Spain in a commanding position after a penalty from Brais Mendez and terrific goal by Japan winger Takefusa Kubo saw them past Danish Midtjylland, who pulled one back through Adam Buksa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the tie will play United or Tottenham in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ajax took charge of their play-off against Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise with a 2-0 victory in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Rasmussen steered the Dutch club ahead just before the hour, with 16-year-old Jorthy Mokio volleying in a second from 20 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's Mohammad Abu Fani struck the only goal in Budapest as Ferencvaros won 1-0 against Viktoria Plzen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time former winners Porto host Roma later on Thursday, while Galatasaray are away to AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in the Conference League, Irish side Shamrock Rovers secured a 1-0 win away to Norwegians Molde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Molde defender Valdemar Lund was sent off before half-time for a challenge on Michael Noonan, who netted the winner in the second half to become the competition's youngest scorer at 16 years and 197 days old.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended higher on Thursday, powered by gains in tech related stocks, with the S&P 500 leading the charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia, Apple and Tesla all rose after President Trump unveiled a roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said the tariffs would match the higher duties charged by other countries and could be imposed within weeks as Trump's trade and economic team studies bilateral tariff and trade relationships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also gained after data showed US producer prices increased in January, while key elements in the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a measure closely tracked by the US Federal Reserve, were benign or lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.04 percent to end at 6,115.07. It was the S&P 500's largest one-day gain since January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq gained 1.50 percent to 19,945.64, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent to 44,711.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla jumped 5.9 percent, Nvidia climbed 3.2 percent and Apple rose 2 percent, lifting the S&P 500 to just short of its record high close on January 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity investors are taking cues from the bond market," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. "Investors were also preparing for kind of an alarmingly high inflation number, based on tariffs." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Panda lovers wishing to catch a glimpse of Ocean Park's new twin cubs can opt for a VIP session each day, with registration for the private visit opening on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, the first pandas to be born in Hong Kong, will make their public debut on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the public could meet the twins from 10am to 3pm every day, with the facility expected to welcome up to 5,000 visitors daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said people could also choose to pay HK$1,500 each for a special, 30-minute visit before the park opens each day. The first visit will be on February 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each session will start at around 9.30am and can accommodate up to 40 people, Pong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ticket holders can get early admission and have a dedicated session to meet the pandas. Each visitor will have to pay 1,500 dollars. After deducting costs, the revenue will be used for the park's giant panda conservation work," Pong told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the sake of animal welfare, there will not be any activities for people to interact with or hold the giant pandas."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair of panda cubs might not appear at the same time to meet the public because they are still young, Pong added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 German authorities said a driver drove a car into a labour union demonstration in central Munich on Thursday, injuring at least 28 people including children.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials said it was believed to be an attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, an Afghan asylum-seeker, was arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident follows a series of attacks involving immigrants in recent months that have pushed migration to the forefront of the campaign for Germany’s February 23 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said on social media platform X that the driver was “secured” and no longer posed any danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  A damaged Mini could be seen at the scene, along with debris including shoes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter said he was “deeply shocked” by the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said participants in a demonstration by the service workers’ union ver.di were walking along a street at about 10.30am when the car overtook a police vehicle following the gathering, accelerated and plowed into the back of the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers arrested the suspect after firing a shot at the car, deputy police chief Christian Huber said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bavarian capital will see heavy security in the coming days because of the three-day Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international foreign and security policy officials, which opens on Friday. (AP)

    Shenzhen Bay Port to close for cross-border marathon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

    China steel warns of 'adverse impact' of US tariffs

<img alt="China's Iron and Steel Association said the tariff rise on steel and aluminum imports to the US would adversely impact the supply chain of the global steel industry. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791504_1_20250213181713.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group representing China's steel industry has warned that a new 25 percent tariff on imports of the product into the United States would have an "adverse impact" on the sector, state media reported on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism," the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, the impact on (China's) steel exports is limited," the CISA said in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing (China's) steel export competitiveness," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being the world's top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with demand slumping in the domestic construction sector, Chinese steel exports have surged, spurring concerns in Washington about overcapacity in foreign markets with harmful effects on US producers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a medium- and long-term perspective, the (US) increase in tariffs will have an adverse impact on industrial and supply chains in the global steel industry, including the Chinese steel industry," CISA deputy secretary-general Zhang Longqiang said, according to CCTV. (AFP)
