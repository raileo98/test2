<div class="itemFullText">
 A DHL cargo plane crashed into a house on Monday morning near Lithuania's capital, killing at least one person.
 <br>
  <br>
  The head of the country's police said plane crashed shortly before landing at Vilnius airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It fell a few kilometres before the airport, it just skidded for a few hundred metres, its debris somewhat caught a residential house," said Police Commissioner-General Renatas Požėla. "Residential infrastructure around the house was on fire, and the house was slightly damaged, but we managed to evacuate people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lithuanian’s public broadcaster LRT, quoting an emergency official, said two people had been taken to the hospital after the crash, and one was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lithuanian airport authority identified the aircraft as a DHL cargo plane arriving from Leipzig, Germany. It posted on the social platform X that city services including a fire truck were on site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24, analysed by The Associated Press, showed the aircraft made a turn to the north of the airport, lining up for landing, before crashing a little more than 1.5 kilometres short of the runway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities did not immediately offer a cause for the crash, which happened just before 5.30 am local time. Weather at the airport was around freezing temperature, with clouds before sunrise and winds around 30 kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  DHL Group, headquartered in Bonn, Germany, did not immediately return a call for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DHL aircraft was operated by Swiftair, a Madrid-based contractor. The carrier could not be immediately reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 737 was 31 years old, which is considered by experts to be an older airframe, though that’s not unusual for cargo flights. (AP)

    Far-right candidate surprises in Romania elections

<img alt="Calin Georgescu has emerged as the surprise leader in Romania's presidential election. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780699_1_20241125121617.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, electoral data showed, and will likely face leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu in a run-off vote in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country's political landscape.
 <br>
  <br>
  Calin Georgescu, who ran independently, led the polls with around 22 percent of the vote, while Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party, or PSD, trailed at 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR, stood at about 18 percent, and George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, took around 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After polls closed, 9.4 million people — about 52 percent of eligible voters — had cast their ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second round of the vote will be held December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen candidates ran for the presidency in the European Union and Nato member country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president serves a five-year term and has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security, foreign policy and judicial appointments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu, 62, ran independently and was not widely known. He outperformed most local surveys, sending shockwaves through Romania's political establishment as he ascended to poll position.
  <br>
  <br>
  After casting his ballot on Sunday, Georgescu said in a post on Facebook that he voted “For the unjust, for the humiliated, for those who feel they do not matter and actually matter the most.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that Georgescu’s unexpected poll performance appears to be a “large protest or revolt against the establishment.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “The mainstream political parties have lost the connection with regular Romanians,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georgescu lacks an agenda, Andrei added, and has a vague and populist manifesto with positions that are “beyond the normal discourse."
  <br>
  <br>
  His stances include supporting Romanian farmers, reducing dependency on imports, and ramping up energy and food production.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to his website, Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania's environment ministry in the 1990s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos posted to his popular TikTok account, where he has amassed 1.6 million likes, depict him attending church, doing judo, running around an oval track, and speaking on podcasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Sunday's vote, many had expected to see Simion, a vocal supporter of US President-elect Donald Trump, face Ciolacu in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from neighbouring Ukraine. (AP)

    'Junior staff not off the hook for medical blunders'

<img alt="A Hospital Authority director says senior management under the accountability framework include hospital chief executives and department heads. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780696_1_20241125120700.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hospital Authority director on Monday said holding senior managers to account for any medical blunders at public hospitals won't mean that lower-ranked staff involved will be off the hook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bosses have pledged to improve governance and spell out the responsibility of staff of all ranks, after a special committee submitted 31 recommendations following a three-month review.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of the reform, the authority said it will develop a framework to strengthen the accountability of senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Wong, the authority's director of quality and safety, said a reform committee will look at a reward and penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Senior management under the accountability framework include hospital chief executives and department heads. Although they're the ones who'll mainly be held responsible, it doesn't mean that no other colleagues should take responsibility," Wong told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those overseeing hospital wards have their corresponding responsibilities, which will be evaluated during the employees' annual appraisals."
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's chairman, Henry Fan, previously said authorities might freeze the pay of senior managers for blunders, but firing employees might not be an option due to a manpower crunch faced by the public healthcare sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Lam, from Hong Kong Patients' Voices, said Fan's comment gives a bad impression.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's no dismissal mechanism when an employee makes a grave mistake, it seems to be like a 'get-out-of-jail free card', which says the employee can keep their job regardless of their mistake, and at worst, may only have their salary frozen," Lam said.

    Cross-border road cycling race a 'success'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute cycling head coach Hervé Dagorne on Monday hailed as a success Sunday's cross-border road race, an event that was largely seen as the first major test ahead of the 15th National Games to be held next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said the organisation of the race, which featured dozens of cyclists traversing a 230-kilometre route that included a crossing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was behind the positive result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was very impressed with how smooth it all turned out," Dagorne said. "This was the first time we could hold such a race passing through a bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's one of the longest bridges in the world, so for us, we were able to gain more knowledge on how we can manage the actual race come next year. We were all very excited, and interested to see what we can achieve in the National Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne also highlighted the obstacles that came with organising the large scale sporting event, and noted what needs to be done ahead of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The matter of immigration is an important aspect when it comes to organisation [of the race]." he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also determine how wind and slope can affect athletes – as such factors can be difficult to predict while passing a bridge compared to when on a car or bus."
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is set to be the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.

    Road cycling trial took less time than anticipated

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Games Coordination Office on Monday said the overall time taken for a cross-border cycling race on Sunday was shorter than expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event was held as a test race for the National Games that will be staged in the Greater Bay Area next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told an RTHK radio programme that the race went very smoothly, and cyclists completed the event safely.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also no special incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cyclists rode slightly faster than we thought. At first, we expected them to take around an hour and 30 minutes to complete the Hong Kong section of the race. But it turned out they completed the leg in an hour and 22 minutes," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That meant that for the whole event, whether heading to Hong Kong Disneyland after passing the bridge as well as heading back to the mainland, it was faster than we anticipated."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said cyclists and their supporting crews told the office after the event that the race distance of 230km posed a challenge for them, and they also struggled with strong winds on the bridge, as well as light rain in Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said the cyclists managed to go faster once they had adapted to the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the race route is suitable for the National Games, but did not rule out the possibility of making adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The presidential candidate of the conservative coalition that has governed Uruguay for the past five years conceded defeat on Sunday after a tight run-off election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The results means the South American nation joined others around the world in rebuking the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the centre-right government’s candidate, told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that “with sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,” referring to left-wing challenger Yamandú Orsi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's centre-left coalition known as the Broad Front, claimed victory as crowds flocked to greet him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,” he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With more than 91 percent of the votes counted, Orsi had close to 50 percent support compared to Delgado’s 46 percent in an election in which nearly 90 percent of voters turned out, according to preliminary data released by the Electoral Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest were blank votes or non-voters.
  <br>
  <br>
  While failing to entice apathetic young voters and generating extraordinary indecision, Uruguay's lacklustre electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighbouring Argentina.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been arrested in the United Arab Emirates in connection with the alleged murder of an Israeli citizen, the Emirati interior ministry said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ministry statement did not give details on the suspects or say if they had been charged, but said all legal powers would be used "to respond decisively and without leniency to any actions or attempts that threaten societal stability".
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office had denounced the killing of the rabbi, Zvi Kogan, 28, as a "heinous anti-semitic terrorist act" and said Israel would do everything it could to bring those responsible to justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local authorities say Kogan was a resident of the UAE and a Moldovan national.
  <br>
  <br>
  He worked with the New York-based Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement and was reported missing on Thursday. His body was found on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He ran a kosher grocery store in Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its attack of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early on Sunday, the UAE’s state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan’s disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistani government team mediated a seven-day ceasefire deal between rival sectarian groups on Sunday, halting days of clashes that have killed some 70 people and injured dozens in the northwest of the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The violence began when gunmen attacked convoys of civilian vehicles on Thursday, killing at least 40 people, mostly Shi'ite Muslims.
  <br>
  <br>
  That sparked retaliatory attacks against Sunni Muslim residents and there were pitched battles between armed groups from both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Armed Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims have engaged in tribal and sectarian rivalry for decades over a land dispute in Kurram district near the Afghanistan border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both sides have agreed to a week-long ceasefire which is expected to be extended," Muhammad Ali Saif, a member of the mediation team, told Reuters by phone, adding that major clashes had already stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif, who is the information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province - where Kurram is located - said both sides also agreed to exchange prisoners, including women and the bodies of those killed in the clashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prisoners and bodies would be exchanged with assistance from Pakistani paramilitary forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team flew into Parachinar, Kurram's main city, on Saturday and met Shi'ite and Sunni tribal leaders with the entire district under curfew and armed groups roaming the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saif said news of the ceasefire should also halt smaller skirmishes that had been reported in remote areas of the district.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another member of the mediation team, Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, the police chief of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said Shi'ite leaders were demanding the immediate arrest of those involved in attacking passenger vehicles, as well as compensation for the victims and safety assurances for travelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is yet to identify or publicly name who the attackers were and no one has claimed responsibility. (Reuters)

    HA looking to use AI to identify high-risk patients

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public hospitals hope that artificial intelligence will help them identify and treat high risk patients at an earlier stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hospital Authority's head of information technology and health informatics, Dr Cheung Ngai-tseung, said the authority was looking to incorporate AI into the existing clinical management system, which contains more than 10 million patients' records, to create automated tools to tailor individual treatments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hospital services have been digitalised, including having paperless patient records that allow for real-time information updates on the authority's HA Go app, which enhances patients' self-care abilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI could be used to remind patients of specific prescriptions and laboratory results in the form of a blue elf on the screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung spoke about future plans to further develop the system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the general capabilities as described is perhaps things like, more use of AI, more use of personalisation, more communication techniques, that sort of thing. Plus specific targeted interventions that will be maybe disease-specific or specific workflows that exist in today's hospitals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Cheung added that more work was needed on specific cases and they were working on a fifth generation of the system.

    OSC funding helps promote inclusiveness in hiking

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity advocating for the conservation of the city's countryside through connecting the public with nature is one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Accessible Trails - a programme dedicated to promoting the benefits of nature to all walks of life - was started in 2017 by Parks and Trails Limited. The charity was founded in 2014 as a mobile application TrailWatch, which gives hikers a platform to track their hikes and report incidents of damage to trails.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its head of communications, Kwong Sum-yin, said the project also helped wheelchair users enjoy greater access to the countryside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, the countryside is actually very convenient. But for some groups of people, it is not as accessible as we think, especially those with disabilities," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project comprises two parts; first it identifies suitable hiking trails for wheelchair users and then it brings participants, their family members and volunteers to the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  17 hiking trails have been verified, and more than 180 wheelchair users and their carers have benefited from the programme since it started.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of the participants tell us that they've never been to the countryside of Hong Kong, or even the New Territories, because it is very inconvenient for them. [Through the programme], they say they can actually enjoy the environment. They feel peaceful and are very happy about that," Kwong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said limited resources had prevented the programme from organising larger-scale activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hiking season in Hong Kong depends on the weather, so it may not be that long. For example, there was one particular trip - we wanted to see the Autumn village - and we have a time concern there as well. Given the limited resources, we cannot organise enough [activities]," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes, wheelchair users tell us it is very difficult to get into the programme, so they can't really go. We really want to expand this programme and have more resources to let more people to enjoy [the nature]," Kwong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the funding would be used not only to recruit more wheelchair users, but also volunteers to understand the difficulties of those with disabilities and contribute to create an inclusive experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah fired Liverpool eight points clear at the top of the Premier League as the leaders survived a scare from lowly Southampton, thanks to the Egypt star's second half double in a 3-2 away win on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had squandered the lead given to them by Dominik Szoboszlai's second goal this season as Adam Armstrong levelled before the break at St Mary's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's 10th win in 12 league games ensured they capitalised on City's dismal 4-0 defeat against Tottenham 24 hours earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first Premier League crown since 2020, the Reds have a golden opportunity to throttle City's hopes of a fifth successive title when Pep Guardiola's team visit Anfield on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have lost five in a row in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, we keep going in that direction," Salah said. "We have a game against them so hopefully, we win it and go 11 points clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Man City is Man City", he added. "They have a bad time now, but they have great players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah now has 12 goals in all competitions this term, including six in his last five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were very important, especially after being down 2-1. It's the most important thing to have won the game," he said. "Each game is different. They had a game plan and played very well – we managed to come back and win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mateus Fernandes put bottom of the table Southampton ahead after the interval before Salah sparred Liverpool's blushes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah coolly netted the equaliser and then held his nerve to stroke home the late penalty that gave him 12 goals in all competitions this season and six in his last five league appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Salah's late heroics, Liverpool have left second placed Manchester City trailing in their wake after the champions' dismal 4-0 defeat against Tottenham on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has made a remarkable start to his time in charge of the Reds, winning 16 of his first 18 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Feyenoord manager's deft touch has established Liverpool as favourites for a first Premier League title since 2020 in his maiden season at Anfield after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were below their best against Southampton but the gritty victory was the ideal start to a pivotal period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds host Real Madrid in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, before Manchester City head to Anfield next weekend. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champion Kansas City edged Carolina and Detroit ripped Indianapolis on Sunday to reach an NFL-best 10-1 while Dallas shocked arch-rival Washington to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns and Spencer Shrader kicked a 31-yard field goal on the final play to lift Kansas City over the host Panthers 30-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuba Hubbard's 1-yard touchdown run and a 2-point conversion run had put Carolina level with just under two minutes remaining, setting the stage for the Chiefs' seven-play, 57-yard march to set up the winning kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the Chiefs with a 10th triumph to keep a conference lead was Detroit, with Jahmyr Gibbs rushing for 90 yards and two touchdowns and David Montgomery running for another score in the Lions' 24-6 triumph at Indianapolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A wild finish with 38 points in the last 5:16 marked the Dallas Cowboys' 34-26 victory at Washington, where the Commanders appeared to have lost, then made an amazing comeback only to fall in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooper Rush's second touchdown pass, a 22-yarder to Luke Schoonmaker with five minutes remaining, gave Dallas a 20-9 edge, but Jayden Daniels threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz and ran for a 2-point conversion to pull Washington within 20-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  KaVontae Turpin answered with a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown on the ensuing play, but again the Commanders responded as Austin Seibert kicked a 51-yard field goal and Daniels connected with Terry McLaurin on an 86-yard touchdown pass with 21 seconds remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seibert, however, shockingly missed the conversion kick to keep Dallas ahead 27-26 and the Cowboys added a Juanyeh Thomas 43-yard kickoff return touchdown on the next play to seal victory. (AFP)

    Sinner leads Italy to second straight Davis Cup title

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner completed his sensational year by leading Italy to a successful defence of the Davis Cup with victory over the Netherlands in the final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number one eased to a 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 triumph against Tallon Griekspoor for the winning point after Matteo Berrettini had put the defending champions ahead with a convincing 6-4, 6-2 win against Botic van de Zandschulp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner ends 2024 with titles at the Australian Open, US Open and the ATP Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole team is amazing, we tried to defend our title and we have done it, so we're extremely happy – there's a lot of work behind it," said Sinner as Italy won the Davis Cup for a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy became the first team to defend the title since the Czech Republic in 2013, and the fifth nation to win it along with the Billie Jean King Cup in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strong Italian support, along with an orange wall of Dutch fans, made for a fine atmosphere at the Martin Carpena arena, with the Netherlands in the final for the first time in 104 years of trying.
  <br>
  <br>
  However defeating Sinner this year has been nigh on impossible for most players, let alone with the pressure of carrying a nation's hopes on their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor, ranked 40th, has now lost all six meetings with Sinner but battled remarkably well, forcing Sinner to save two early break points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serving brilliantly, Griekspoor twice held to love and hit two aces in the 12th game to force a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner secured an early mini-break and another for a 5-2 lead, firing down his 12th ace to take the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian brought up and converted his first break point of the match to take a 2-1 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor produced a backhand winner to drag his way back on serve but undid his good work with a double fault that allowed Sinner to break again for a 3-2 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was up for the Dutch and Sinner broke again in the seventh game before sealing his triumph with his fourth match point with a scorching serve Griekspoor could not return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no other option than playing a high level match – if you want to have a chance against Jannik in this kind of form, this kind of shape, this kind of confidence," said Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jannik is very tough to beat, especially, with the season he had, he deserves all of it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis was part of the last Dutch team to reach the semi-finals 22 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a love relationship with second place, I have a hate relationship with second place," said Haarhuis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though I'm unbelivably proud of the guys, for now it feels (terrible)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini edged the first set against Van de Zandschulp but hit his peak in the second and left the Dutchman no chance, winning in 76 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 35, who came to support Italy as they ended a 47-year wait for the trophy in 2023 as he missed out with an ankle injury, was crucial in their Davis Cup defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old paired up with Sinner to help Italy triumph in a doubles decider against Argentina in the last eight, before winning his semi-final singles rubber against Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels unbelievable, it feels really great to be on court – if you win it's better, but being able to be healthy, here and enjoying this kind of atmosphere is the most important thing for me, because I missed that," said Berrettini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely feel that my level never really left. When you're struggling physically and mentally it's not easy to play your best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Van de Zandschulp, ranked 80th, became the last player to defeat Rafael Nadal before the Spanish superstar headed into retirement earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  However he was blown away by Berrettini, who moved ahead in the ninth game of the first set. The Italian opened up three break points and took the first to claim a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second set Berrettini, who was Wimbledon runner-up in 2021, broke in the third game and again in the seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian produced 10 forehand winners and 16 aces on his way to victory, teeing up Sinner to finish the tie. (AFP)

    Man Utd held by Ipswich in Amorim's first match

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim was given a stark illustration of the size of his task at Manchester United after his uninspiring team were held 1-1 by struggling Ipswich in his first match in charge on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss – the latest man tasked with restoring the club to the top of English football – spoke before kick-off about the need to be "patient".
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had barely settled in his seat at a blustery Portman Road before Marcus Rashford turned in Amad Diallo's inviting cross, stunning the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich, who started the day in the relegation zone, battled back, earning the equaliser they deserved through Omari Hutchinson just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither side could find a winner in the second period despite chances at both ends, with the result leaving both managers unsatisfied.
  <br>
  <br>
  United are a lowly 12th in the Premier League, six points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, while Ipswich are still in the drop zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who cut an animated figure on the touchline, said his players were guilty of over-thinking during the game against Kieran McKenna's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think my players were thinking too much," he told Sky Sports. "We lost some balls without pressure. But they really, really tried and they want this."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This week I spoke more to the media than I did in four years at Sporting," he added. "I just want to work with my players – nothing more." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Sunday said people should only use gas water heaters in well-ventilated areas. It made the comment after a 56-year-old man, and two of his family members, were hospitalised on Saturday with carbon monoxide poisoning after he took a shower.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three were sent to Yan Chai Hospital. The man was later transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. His two family members, including a 13-year-old, were discharged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) also reminded people to only use gas water heaters which have a 'GU' mark, meaning they have been approved by the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said all windows in the apartment were shut and the exhaust fan had not been turned on. An on-site inspection conducted by the EMSD showed that the flueless gas water heater at the home was not suitable to be used in bathrooms. The heater model also lacked approval from the department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EMSD has seized the gas water heater. It will investigate whether any person has contravened the Gas Safety Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CHP said that carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas which is a by-product from incomplete combustion of any fuel which contains carbon, such as wood, natural gas and gasoline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposure to a low concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to a range of symptoms such as dizziness, headache, tiredness and nausea. Exposure to a high concentration of carbon monoxide can lead to impaired vision, disturbed co-ordination, unconsciousness, brain damage or even death.

<img alt="Josep Borrell (pictured) speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780634_1_20241124203648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an "immediate ceasefire" in the Israel-Hezbollah war while on a visit to the Lebanese capital for talks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since September 23, Israel has intensified its air campaign in Lebanon, later sending in ground troops following nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah in support of its ally Hamas after the Palestinian group's October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see only one possible way ahead: an immediate ceasefire and the full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701," Borrell said after meeting Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has led mediation efforts on behalf of Hezbollah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Resolution 1701 ended the last Hezbollah-Israel war of 2006 and stated that Lebanese troops and UN peacekeepers should be the only armed forces in the country's south, where Hezbollah holds sway.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also called for Israel to withdraw troops from Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Back in September I came and was still hoping we could prevent a full-fledged war of Israel attacking Lebanon," Borrell said on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two months later Lebanon is on the brink of collapse."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the European Union was ready to provide 200 million euros for Lebanon's army, whose deployment in larger numbers along the border forms a crucial point in truce talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France and Washington have been spearheading ceasefire efforts, with US envoy Amos Hochstein visiting Lebanon and Israel this week to discuss a truce plan based on implementing Resolution 1701.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must pressure the Israeli government and maintain the pressure on Hezbollah to accept the US proposal for a ceasefire," Borrell said, calling for an "immediate" truce. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American golfer Patrick Reed has won the Hong Kong Open in style, shooting a 22-under overall to clinch the title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The overnight leader entered the final day with a three-shot lead, after notching a 59, an 18-hole record at the historic Fanling course.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA Tour professional ended up edging defending champion, Ben Campbell from New Zealand by the same margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was Reed's fifth time playing in Hong Kong, and he told reporters that he was glad to have finally triumphed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome playing this golf course, to come out and learn from the mistakes from the past on this place, and to go out and really feel like I was in command and control around a golf course," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was able to hit quality golf shots after quality golf shots, which has always been a tough thing around here for me in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho finished six shots behind Reed, good for a tied-sixth overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he didn't have the best of starts on the final day, but he felt he bounced back well and there were still plenty of positive takeaways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was just really focused out there and I was able to let myself play golf. You know, towards the start of it, I wasn't too comfortable to swing, so I was aiming away, aiming at the middle of the greens," the Hong Kong, China golfer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But once I felt like I'd gone in the groove of it, I was able to aim at flags a bit more and get a bit more aggressive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of spectators were on hand for the tournament at the Fanling Golf Course, with many families bringing their children for a nice day out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them was Queenie, a mother of two who managed to share a photo moment with Kho.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so excited, I got an autograph, a photograph with him. He’s so nice, very friendly,” she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament was also a test event for next year’s National Games, when golf will be one of eight sports Hong Kong will be hosting while other events take place in Macau and Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said both local and mainland officials have been at the site in the past few days to gauge the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They assess various aspects of the tournament. My feeling is I think they are quite happy with what the club and the organisers have put forward in this tournament," Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we can carry this momentum forward to the National Games next year and put together a very good show for both Hong Kong and spectators from afar."

    'Volunteering scheme aims to motivate CSSA recipients'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday defended plans to mandate certain government subsidy recipients to do voluntary work, saying it is a way of helping them integrate into society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun was referring to a new Social Welfare Department pilot scheme, which will make it compulsory for unemployed Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) recipients aged 15 to 59 to take up at least one hour of unpaid work each week.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted 16,000 CSSA recipients are healthy adults capable of working, and hoped that the scheme can motivate them to start looking for a job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't want CSSA recipients to feel like they are out of touch... We think the most viable way is to ask them to do volunteering work. This is achievable and there's a great social need for this kind of work," Sun told reporters after attending a charity event.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the labour chief also expressed great concern regarding two fatal industrial accidents on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One case involved an 18-year-old apprentice, who fell into an escalator shaft in Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other fatality was a 57-year-old painter, who died after being trapped on a spider lift platform while working at a Tung Chung public housing construction site.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department has issued suspension notices to the contractors involved, and is investigating the accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The probe will focus on whether the two sites complied with the necessary work procedures. Everyone knows there are clear guidelines for both escalator maintenance and the use of lift platforms," Sun commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the need to step up promotion and education efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that whenever an accident occurs, other workers in the trade can raise their safety awareness and sense of responsibility... The government, employers, employees and relevant stakeholders should all work towards this goal."

<img alt="HKFYG's Employment and Economy Group convenor Tony Lau (centre) says young people still treat Hong Kong as their home and want to develop their careers here. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780628_1_20241124172139.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five in six young adults in Hong Kong believe the city needs to undergo economic transformation, but only two in 10 of them have considered a career pivot, according to a think tank.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups urged the government to do more to help fresh graduates and early career professionals plan ahead, as well as boost their confidence towards the city’s future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group conducted face-to-face interviews of 600 people aged 18 to 34 between September and October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than 40 per cent of respondents agreed that Hong Kong has a positive economic outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 60 percent of them expressed concerns about various issues, including a potential pay cut and a perceived lack of skills to stay competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the pessimism, the vast majority still planned on developing their careers in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Young people still treat Hong Kong as their home. They are willing to contribute to the economy," said Tony Lau, convenor of the federation's employment and economy group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important for the Hong Kong government to cultivate local talent, and they should roll out their utmost measures to retain them and provide training," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Researchers also explained that the majority of respondents had not considered a career transition because of a “lack of clarity” in their direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many said they were unsure which industry they could switch to, while others admitted they lacked the skills and knowledge to make a move, or were simply not interested in the openings on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The federation suggested young people learn more about the development plans in the Greater Bay Area or Belt and Road countries, and explore opportunities in new markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another way to start, researchers said, is to study manpower projection reports, which predict a labour shortage in aviation and innovative technology industries.

 Raging orange flames and thick black smoke billowed into the sky on Sunday as fire ripped through hundreds of houses in a closely built slum area of the Philippine capital Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Manila Fire District said around 1,000 houses were burned in the blaze that is thought to have started on the second floor of one of the homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no immediate reports of casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drone footage shared online by the city's disaster agency showed houses in Isla Puting Bato village of Manila razed to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The structures housed around 2,000 families, according to the fire department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Village resident Leonila Abiertas, 65, lost almost all her possessions, but managed to save her late husband's ashes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only got the urn with the ashes of my husband," a crying Abiertas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really don't know how I can start my life again after this fire."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fire and disaster services deployed 36 trucks and four fire boats while the country's air force sent in two helicopters to help extinguish the fire.

    Police arrest 11 over online shopping 'scams'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they arrested 11 people, including a student, after officers said they busted a local fraud syndicate allegedly behind three online shopping scams involving HK$640,000.
 <br>
  <br>
  Detectives said the scammers, aged 20 to 50, reached out to sellers of luxury spirits and watches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fraudsters would then ask to meet at an office under a short-term lease. To gain the sellers' trust, the suspects posing as buyers even meticulously inspected the products and spoke industry jargon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transactions were then settled in cash, or "practice banknotes". The tools are used by bank staff to learn how to manually count currency, and usually bear the words "not for circulation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The meeting room was carefully set up, and the counterfeit banknotes closely resembled genuine HK$500 notes in size, shape, colour, and texture," said Chau Ho-haung, an inspector with the Wan Chai district crime squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The scammers even placed real banknotes at the top and bottom of the stack of fake notes, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the sellers eventually realised they had been duped, the suspects had already made off with the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police offered some tips for people conducting face-to-face trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The money and the goods should change hands simultaneously, detectives said, and sellers should never hand over items before receiving payment.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the case of bank transfers, the seller must also verify the payment has been cleared.

 Two women, aged 38 and 44, have been charged with one count of trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs arrested them on Saturday, after officers found about 10 kilos of suspected cannabis buds inside their check-in suitcases.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two women had arrived in Hong Kong on a flight from Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Customs estimate the suspected drugs have a street value of about HK$2.3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man was shot dead and three members of the security services wounded after gunfire at dawn on Sunday in the neighbourhood in Jordan's capital where the Israeli embassy is located, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Public Security Directorate announced that it dealt with an incident of gunfire at a patrol operating in the Rabieh area in the capital, Amman, at dawn on Sunday," the official Petra news agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said a gunman opened fire on a patrol and was later surrounded by security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man "started firing gunshots at the security force, which in turn applied the rules of engagement, which resulted in the killing of the perpetrator", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said three public security personnel were injured during the incident and were receiving treatment. (AFP)

<img alt="Some travellers were left frustrated by the closure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780609_2_20241124141606.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cross-border road cycling race which doubled as a test event for the National Games held in the Greater Bay Area next year went ahead smoothly on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 67 cyclists set off from Zhuhai at 9am for the men's individual 230-kilometres event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The peloton arrived in Hong Kong about 90 minutes later via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The cyclists continued east along the North Lantau Highway, and headed back to the mainland after passing Hong Kong Disneyland in Sunny Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offered authorities a chance to gauge disruption to traffic. Lanes in both directions on the cross-border bridge were closed in staggered intervals to allow the cyclists to pass through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic fully resumed shortly after 12:30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some Hong Kong travellers arriving the border checkpoint were unaware of the temporary arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know the roads were closed today. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come. I plan to go home, and return this afternoon," Mr Fong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but there wasn't much information available. I'm really frustrated because I have no idea how to get to Zhuhai," another man bemoaned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they should definitely issue more information or reminders on the MTR. There should be announcements at every station. If I'd known in advance, I could have made alternative plans," said another traveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unique nature of the race drew a lot of interest from locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the news yesterday, so I wanted to come here and take pictures. I used to take part in road cycling races ... I hope Zhuhai will continue to develop this sport and hold similar events every year,” a Zhuhai resident said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he came all the way from Zhongshan to support his former teammates who participated in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I arrived in Zhuhai two days ago because my former teammates also arrived early to acclimatise to the environment. I came here to cycle with them. It really brought back memories of us training together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung said his colleagues would review the arrangements with their mainland and Macau counterparts, and seek further improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said as a result of the road closures, travellers to and from the airport spent 20 to 25 minutes longer on average this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was already less than what we forecast at the beginning. So I think overall, the test event has been carried out very smoothly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted three cyclists had to abandon the Hong Kong section of the race, although there were no accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, revealed the General Administration of Sport of China has not decided how many cyclists can sign up for the actual race next year.

    Govt-market integration key for Hetao: Sun Dong

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry on Sunday said government backing and an efficient market are both necessary, if plans to expand a Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech zone were to succeed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong's comments came days after officials unveiled the development outline for the SAR section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the development now covers twice the gross floor area compared to the original scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said he explained to his friends in Shanghai what Hetao is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them today's Northern Metropolis is like Shanghai's Pudong district in the old days, and that Hetao is equivalent to Pudong's Oriental Pearl," he recalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They immediately understood that this is extremely important for Hong Kong's future development."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added mainland officials faced similar challenges when they developed Pudong in the 1990s. But they made it happen, even with a limited budget, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US president-elect Donald Trump's tech restrictions on China and how it might affect Hong Kong, Sun said the city should work more closely with the mainland and strengthen its own technology infrastructure to cope with the complex global environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The innovation chief also called on local tech companies to procure supplies and equipment from different sources, instead of relying too much on a single market.

    Climate summit US$300bn deal 'a paltry sum'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world approved a bitterly negotiated climate deal on Sunday but poorer nations most at the mercy of worsening disasters dismissed a US$300 billion a year pledge from wealthy historic polluters as insultingly low.
 <br>
  <br>
  After two exhausting weeks of chaotic bargaining and sleepless nights, nearly 200 nations banged through the contentious finance pact in the early hours in a sports stadium in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the applause had barely subsided in Baku when India delivered a full-throated rejection of the dollar-figure just agreed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It's a paltry sum," said Indian delegate Leena Nandan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This document is little more than an optical illusion. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nations had struggled to reconcile long-standing divisions over how much rich nations most accountable for historic climate change should provide to poorer countries least responsible but most impacted by Earth's rapid warming.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said COP29 would be remembered as "the start of a new era for climate finance".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sleep-deprived diplomats, huddled in anxious groups, were still revising the final phrasing on the plenary floor hours before the deal passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At points, the talks appeared on the brink of collapse, with developing nations storming out of meetings and threatening to walk away should rich nations not cough up more cash.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the end -- despite repeating that no deal is better than a bad deal -- they did not stand in the way of an agreement, despite it falling well short of what they wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal commits developed nations to pay at least US$300 billion a year by 2035 to help developed countries green their economies and prepare for worse disasters.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is up from US$100 billion under an existing pledge but was slammed as offensively low by developing nations who had demanded much more.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This COP has been a disaster for the developing world," said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously."
  <br>
  <br>
  A group of 134 developing countries had pushed for at least US$500 billion from rich governments to build resilience against climate change and cut emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
  <br>
  <br>
  UN climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the deal was imperfect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country got everything they wanted, and we leave Baku with a mountain of work still to do. So this is no time for victory laps," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and EU have wanted newly wealthy emerging economies like China -- the world's largest emitter -- to chip in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final deal "encourages" developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis, reflecting no change for China which already provides climate finance on its own terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy nations said it was politically unrealistic to expect more in direct government funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump, a sceptic of both climate change and foreign assistance, returns to the White House in January and a number of other Western countries have seen right-wing backlashes against the green agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal posits a larger overall target of US$1.3 trillion per year to cope with rising temperatures and disasters, but most would come from private sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wealthy countries and small island nations were also concerned by efforts led by Saudi Arabia to water down calls from last year's summit in Dubai to phase out fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The main texts proposed in Baku lacked any explicit mention of the Dubai commitment to "transitioning away from fossil fuels".
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of countries had accused Azerbaijan, an authoritarian oil and gas exporter, of lacking the experience and will to meet the moment, as the planet again sets temperature records and faces rising deadly disasters. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City collapsed to their fifth straight defeat on Saturday, hammered 4-0 by Tottenham in another huge blow to their Premier League title hopes as Arsenal got their challenge back on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rout at the Etihad ends City's 52-game unbeaten home run and leaves manager Pep Guardiola scrambling for answers just two days after he signed a contract extension with the club he has guided to four consecutive league titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the start of the match, City staged a spectacular tribute to the injured Rodri, who showcased the Ballon d'Or trophy he won last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the feel-good spirit did not last long as Spurs showed the home team how much they are missing the Spain midfielder, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored twice in the opening 20 minutes and Pedro Porro extended Tottenham's lead early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs completed their crushing win in stoppage time when Timo Werner raced down the left, squaring for Brennan Johnson to slide home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we have to live it and break it winning the next games, especially the next one. Now we see things in one way, maybe in a few weeks we see it differently."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added: "The fire is when you win a lot of games, which is better than when you are losing, but we accept this. We have to move forward and break it and try."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who have lost their past three Premier League matches and their last five in all competitions, remain five points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand against Southampton on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time defending Premier League champions travel to Anfield next weekend, where defeat would leave their title hopes in tatters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are now in sixth spot, said he was proud of his side, admitting said it was possible to become "spooked" against City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They test you in every way - mentally, physically, tactically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal earlier crushed Nottingham Forest 3-0 to pull level on 22 points with third-placed Chelsea, who saw off Leicester in the early kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's Gunners were expected to be contenders for City's crown after finishing second in each of the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they had failed to win in their previous four league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard's return from a long injury lay-off is a major boost for Arsenal and he teed up Bukayo Saka to blast home the opener on 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka turned provider for another special strike, this time by Thomas Partey early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenager Ethan Nwaneri then came off the bench to score his first Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking about Odegaard, who returned to action at Inter Milan earlier this month, Arteta said: "It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea remain ahead of Arsenal on goals scored after a 2-1 win on manager Enzo Maresca's return to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson scored the opener but Chelsea struggled to make their dominance count until Enzo Fernandez headed home, before a late consolation goal from the penalty spot for Jordan Ayew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa are now winless in six games in all competition and had to twice come from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's incredible start under 31-year-old boss Fabian Hurzeler continued with a 2-1 win at Bournemouth to climb to fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are out of the bottom three thanks to a stunning 4-1 win at Fulham, with Matheus Cunha scoring twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton failed to take advantage of an early red card for Brentford's Christian Norgaard in a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World champions South Africa hammered Wales 45-12 in Cardiff on Saturday to condemn Warren Gatland's team to a 12th consecutive Test defeat and a winless calendar year for the first time since 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Springboks were dominant throughout at the Principality Stadium, scoring seven tries to two in a relentless display that matched attacking accuracy with defensive brutality and set-piece mastery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result meant the Boks, who wrapped up the Rugby Championship title this year, finish their season with 11 victories from 13 Tests, having used a whopping 52 players and scoring 57 tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first two games we weren't happy, there was so much we could have done better," Springbok captain Siya Kolisi told TNT Sports of opening November victories over Scotland and England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Results are important but it's how you do things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the first time South Africa have won all their matches on their November tour since 2013 and means they will see in 2025 as World Rugby's number one ranked country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boks' sole losses were one-point defeats by Argentina and Ireland, a record of which Gatland and his backroom staff could only dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales' last victory came over pool opponents Georgia in October 2023 at the Rugby World Cup, with Gatland having to blood a raft of inexperienced players after a host of seniors hung up their boots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-match entertainment included choirs singing "Yma O Hyd", the Dafydd Iwan folk song that has become the go-to song for Welsh football's "Red Wall" support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, it translates into English as "Still Here", albeit in reference to Wales and the Welsh language and not Gatland per se.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Welsh Rugby Union has its AGM on Sunday where discussions are expected on the New Zealander's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You don't make a decision straight after a game," said Gatland. "Let's just see what happens over the next few days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales captain Dewi Lake told TNT Sports his side had showed "a lot of heart and character".
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are double world champions, that's not for no reason," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to keep the faith, the second we lose our faith in ourselves then it's pointless us stepping on the field, we can definitely see a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scene was set within the opening eight frantic minutes in the Welsh capital as the visiting lock pair of Franco Mostert and Eben Etzebeth each crossed for a try after deft attacking lead-up play by Kurt-Lee Arendse on both occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kolisi was held up over the line by James Botham, but the Boks fired back to the Welsh line and Arendse got his just rewards for his strong start, stepping inside Blair Murray's attempted tackle with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Hendrikse converted two of the three tries to make it 19-0 after the opening quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray did well to hold up Aphelele Fassi over the line and Kolisi had a try disallowed, but the toll on Wales was beginning to show.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long could their defence hold out? Not long as the Boks promptly pushed Wales off their own ball at scrum time and flanker Elrigh Louw barged over for the visitors' fourth five-pointer after a quick tap penalty by Jasper Wiese.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rare Welsh incursion into the opposition half saw the home side, wearing white to avoid a colour-blindness clash with the green of South Africa, go for an attacking line-out, but the Boks repelled two 12-man mauls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was eventually moved wide and Welsh winger Rio Dyer showed a brilliant flash of raw pace to scorch the defence for a fine individual try. Sam Costelow missed the conversion to leave the score 26-5 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fassi crossed for South Africa's fifth try after the outstanding Arendse split the Welsh line early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A raft of replacements for both sides gave Wales a degree of respite, but it was not long before Gerhard Steenkamp was driven over from short range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things turned scrappy and the 67,236-strong crowd turned attention away from the action and Welsh hymns to foot-stomping Mexican waves, always a sure sign the game was well and over as a contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrikse crossed for the Boks' seventh try and converted for a personal game tally of 15 points before a Botham consolation try converted by Ben Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other Test action, New Zealand saw off Italy 29-11 in their final match of the year as Sam Cane was given a winning farewell to international rugby in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Roigard, Will Jordan, Mark Tele'a and Beauden Barrett scored the tries as the All Blacks beat Italy for the 18th consecutive time, with fly-half Barrett kicking the rest visitors' points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cane closed out his Test career with 104 caps, and T-J Perenara also played his final All Blacks match as a second half substitute. (AFP)

    Sudan army says recaptures key state capital

<img alt="Since April 2023, the war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780565_1_20241123223549.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sudanese army said on Saturday it had retaken a key state capital south of Khartoum from rival paramilitaries who had held it for the past five months.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sennar state capital of Sinja is a strategic prize in the 19-month-old war between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces as it lies on a key road linking army-controlled areas of eastern and central Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The army said that Sinja had been "liberated... from the terrorist militia."
  <br>
  <br>
  It posted footage on social media that it said had been filmed inside the main base in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sinja has returned to the embrace of the nation," the information minister of the army-backed government, Khaled al-Aiser, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiser's office said armed forces chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan had travelled to the city of Sennar, 60 kilometres to the north, on Saturday to "inspect the operation and celebrate the liberation of Sinja."
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF had taken the two cities in a lightning offensive in June that saw nearly 726,000 civilians flee, according to UN figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights groups have said that those who were unwilling or unable to leave have faced months of arbitrary violence by RSF fighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinja teacher Abdullah al-Hassan spoke of his "indescribable joy" at seeing the army enter the city after "months of terror."
  <br>
  <br>
  "At any moment, you were waiting for militia fighters to barge in and beat you or loot you," the 53-year-old said by telephone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides in the Sudanese conflict have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminately shelling homes, markets and hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RSF has also been accused of summary executions, systematic sexual violence and rampant looting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The paramilitaries control nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur as well as large swathes of Kordofan in the south. They also hold much of the capital Khartoum and the key farming state of Al-Jazira to its south.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since April 2023, the war has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 11 million – creating what the UN says is the world's largest displacement crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the eastern state of Gedaref – where more than 1.1 million displaced people have sought refuge – Asia Khedr, 46, said she hoped her family's ordeal might soon be at an end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll finally go home and say goodbye to this life of displacement and suffering," she said. (AFP)

<img alt="People running errands in Edinburgh before the heavy snow arrives. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780562_1_20241123214307.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain and Ireland faced travel chaos on Saturday as a winter storm battered northwest Europe with strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice.
 <br>
  <br>
  Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties in Ireland without power and closed roads and some ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Media footage showed flooding in the west of Ireland, while floods prompted rail closures in Northern Ireland and snow impacted travel across Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UK Met Office issued warnings for snow and ice for those regions, warning there was a "good chance some rural communities could be cut off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scottish hills could see up to 40 centimetres of snow, while winds approaching 113 kilometres per hour were recorded in parts of Britain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferry operator DFDS cancelled services on some routes until Monday, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avanti West Coast, which runs rail services between England and Scotland, advised customers not to attempt travel beyond the northern English city of Preston, as it cancelled numerous trains.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Highways also issued a "severe weather alert," warning of "blizzard conditions" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England, with a number of road closures announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Met Eireann, the Irish National Meteorological Service, had also issued a yellow warning for "very strong winds and heavy rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The worst impacted areas for power outages in Ireland were in western and northwestern counties, according to ESB Networks, which runs the country's electricity system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Crews and contractors are deployed and restoring power in impacted areas where it is safe to do so," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 properties across Britain were without power by mid-Saturday -- the majority in southwest England – with the National Grid operator saying power had been restored to "many homes and businesses."
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lebanon said an Israeli air strike in the heart of Beirut that brought down a residential building and jolted residents across the city killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The attack in the capital was followed by others in the city's southern suburbs after calls by the Israeli military to evacuate the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel has not commented on the strike in central Beirut, while Hezbollah has yet to mention it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rescue operations were underway in the area on Saturday morning, with an excavator removing the rubble of the eight-storey building, and a fire truck and civil defence rescuers stationed nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strike was so strong it felt like the building was about to fall on our heads," said Samir, 60, who lives in a building facing the one that was destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he fled his home in the middle of the night with his wife and children.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw two dead people on the ground... The children started crying and their mother cried even more," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli strike, which hit the working-class Basta neighbourhood, killed at least 11 people and wounded 63, Lebanon's health ministry said, adding it had also left behind "a large amount of body parts that are being identified."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The final death toll will be determined after DNA tests are carried out," the ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The state-run National News Agency said Israeli jets had launched six missiles at the structure, causing "widespread destruction in buildings" nearby.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-dawn attack in Basta was not preceded by an evacuation warning from Israel's military.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Lebanese security source said on condition of anonymity that the strike had "targeted a leading Hezbollah figure," though it was unclear if they were killed. The official did not name the figure. (AFP)

    S Korea will not attend Sado mine memorial in Japan

<img alt="The network of mines was added to Unesco's World Heritage register in July. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780553_1_20241123194107.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea has decided not to attend a memorial ceremony set to take place in Japan to honour wartime forced labour victims, including many Koreans, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The East Asian neighbours have long been at odds over historical issues linked to Japan's brutal colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, including sexual slavery and forced labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  In July, a network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register, after South Korea voiced objections to its listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul had dropped its initial objections "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo had agreed to host a memorial event every year – its first edition set to be held on Sado Island on Sunday – to honour the forced labour victims, as a condition for South Korea's consent to the Unesco listing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Saturday, Seoul said the country would "not attend the Sado mine memorial ceremony, scheduled for November 24, taking into account various circumstances surrounding the event."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was insufficient time to reconcile differing positions between the diplomatic authorities of both countries, making it unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement before the ceremony," it added, without elaborating further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo said earlier this week that Akiko Ikuina, a parliamentary vice minister at Japan's foreign ministry, will attend the ceremony as the government's representative, according to Seoul's Yonhap news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement was met with criticism from some local media outlets in Seoul, as she has visited the Yasukuni Shrine – a site considered highly sensitive in South Korea due to the enshrinement of some of Japan's war criminals there. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 It was an historic day for American Patrick Reed at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling on Saturday, as he shot a rare round of 59 to catapult himself into a three-stroke lead at the end of day three.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 2018 winner at Augusta carded 11 birdies in his sizzling 11-under-par third round to go 18-under overall on the prestigious Asian Tour event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old's milestone is the lowest score ever in the tournament and overtakes a 60 scored by Britain's Ian Poulter in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had probably one of my worst warm-ups ever," Reed, 34, who is among a number of big-name players to have jumped ship to the Saudi-backed Liv Golf circuit, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked at my caddie and he said, 'Hey, a warm-up's a warm-up. Let's go out and just play golf. Some of your best rounds have come from a poor warm-up.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  The American started with a blistering five birdies in a row and rattled off four more on the trot to finish with a flurry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I honestly felt it could have been lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going into the final round in Fanling, Reed holds a three-shot lead over India's Rashid Khan and Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand as he chases a first win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand is a further shot back at 14-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong golfing sensation Taichi Kho shot a four-under-par 66 for round three to go 12-under overall, as the tournament gears up for its final round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho, along with six other players, ended the afternoon strong to hold on to a tie for sixth place – after a dominant display that saw him grouped with Japan's Kazuki Higa and Kevin Yuan of Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting off with a birdie was great," Kho told reporters. "I capitalised on a good second shot on the sixth [hole], and got away with a good break on thirteenth being behind a tree – but I had a big gap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So being able to hit it on and two from there, and two putting from birdie, definitely helped boost my round quite a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the 24-year-old bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open crown, he also noted the challenges he overcame throughout the afternoon under rainier conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A bit of fortune there," Kho said. "There were times where I found myself in the trees, but I managed to find an opening without much concern, which gave me the focus I needed to hit a good shot."
  <br>

    Mixed reactions to third stress test in Kai Tak

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Saturday evening said a test event at Kai Tak had gone smoothly, and the results were satisfactory. They added that they think the venue they used is ready to host more events.
 <br>
  <br>
  But there were mixed responses to the third stress test at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground, which was aiming to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test involved 4,500 civil servants and 500 members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike previous trials, designated seating was adopted this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test kicked off at 3.30pm and was expected to run until 8.45pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Wong attending the event, said the trial would finish too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They said it will end at around 8.45pm, but restaurants will already be closing by then. Many places will have called last orders already, so you can't really go out and enjoy dinner. You can only head home directly after the test," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong revealed that he was only told on Monday that he had to attend the event, and he had to reschedule his birthday celebration for it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another participant surnamed Cheung headed to the sports ground from Sung Wong Toi station.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there are some canopies along the way, but said that it would be better if there were more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also told RTHK that he appreciated the signage from the MTR station to the venue, adding that the walk took less than 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of signs and staff. Everything is very clear. We definitely didn't take an unnecessarily long route."
  <br>
  <br>
  But a man surnamed Au said his journey from the Sung Wong Toi area had many zig zag routes, which may take time for the public to familiarise with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police chief Raymond Siu revealed that officers from the tactical unit were deployed to the stress test.

 At least 32 people were killed and 47 wounded in sectarian clashes in northwest Pakistan, an official said on Saturday, two days after attacks on Shi'ite passenger convoys killed 43.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporadic fighting between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan has killed around 150 over the past months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fighting between Shi'ite and Sunni communities continues at multiple locations. According to the latest reports, 32 people have been killed which include 14 Sunnis and 18 Shi'ites," a senior administrative official said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, gunmen opened fire on two separate convoys of Shi'ite Muslims travelling with a police escort in Kurram, killing 43 while 11 wounded are still in "critical condition", officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In retaliation, Shi'ite Muslims on Friday evening attacked several Sunni locations in the Kurram district, once a semi-autonomous region, where sectarian violence has resulted in the deaths of hundreds over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Around 7 pm (1400 GMT), a group of enraged Shi'ite individuals attacked the Sunni-dominated Bagan Bazaar," said a senior police officer stationed in Kurram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After firing, they set the entire market ablaze and entered nearby homes, pouring petrol and setting them on fire. Initial reports suggest over 300 shops and more than 100 houses have been burned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local Sunnis "also fired back at the attackers," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Javedullah Mehsud, a senior official in Kurram said there were "efforts to restore peace ... (through) the deployment of security forces" and with the help of "local elders." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers can start moving into new offices on Saturday, with the renovation works for the first phase of the expansion project at the Legislative Council Complex completed ahead of schedule.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his social media, the council's president, Andrew Leung, said that the early move is a testament to the unity and cooperation of all members and staff involved in the project, adding that lawmakers can finally "get to the next level under one roof".
  <br>
  <br>
  The renovation included the addition of four storeys to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung said that the relocation will allow all members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as a temporary office to return to the complex, while also moving members already in the building to higher levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that some finishing touches are still needed, such as waterproofing the exterior walls, clean up, and interior design, adding that the Secretariat, together with the Architectural Services Department and contractor, would follow up with the matter. He encouraged lawmakers to share their suggestions for improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Leung said that the second phase of the expansion project would start as soon as possible, including the construction of a new conference room and public education facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes that all expansion projects will be completed before October of next year.

    Rich nations raise climate pledge offer to US$300bn

<img alt="The previous offer of US$250bn a year had been panned by developing countries as insultingly low. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780526_1_20241123153155.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union, United States and other wealthy countries at the COP29 climate summit have agreed to raise their offer of a global finance target to US$300 billion per year by 2035, sources said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The summit had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries – who must adopt the deal by consensus – tried to reach agreement on the world's climate funding plan for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shift in position came after a US$250 billion proposal for a deal, drafted by Azerbaijan's COP29 presidency on Friday, was panned by developing countries as insultingly low.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear if the wealthy countries' revised position had been communicated to developing countries at COP29, and whether it would be enough to win their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five sources with knowledge of the closed-door discussions said the EU had agreed they could accept the higher number. Two of the sources said the United States, Australia and Britain were also on board.
  <br>
  <br>
  A European Commission spokesperson and an Australian government spokesperson both declined to comment on the negotiations. The US delegation at COP29 and the UK energy ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates were awaiting a new draft text of the deal on climate finance on Saturday after negotiators worked through the night to bridge wide gaps in their positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 talks have laid bare the divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from the soaring costs of storms, floods and droughts fuelled by climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new goal is intended to replace developed countries' previous commitment to provide US$100 billion in climate finance for poorer nations per year by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. (Reuters)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown drains a three-pointer on his way to top-scoring for the Boston Celtics. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780523_1_20241123151736.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown top-scored with 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics struggled to a 108-96 win at Washington in the NBA Cup on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics moved to 13-8 on the season but still have some work to do in the NBA Cup, where they are in second place at 2-1 in Eastern Conference Group C behind the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their celebratory trip to the White House on Thursday, the Celtics trailed by two at half-time, having been 11 points behind at one stage, and it wasn't until late in the fourth quarter that they were able to pull away from the Wizards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown delivered down the stretch, his superb turnaround jumper giving Boston a 99-92 lead and ending Washington's resistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a vintage Celtics performance though.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum, who scored 16 points, was 0-for-10 from three-point range and Boston shot 42.4 percent from the floor and 23.9 percent from three-point range, equalling their lowest scoring output of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla picked up a technical foul in the second half for remonstrating with the referee but said his emotions had an impact on the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It changed the energy in the arena. Did you feel that? It wasn't really about energising the guys, it was more about manipulating the environment. It was just what the environment needed at the time," said Mazzulla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, without the injured Luka Doncic, survived a strong comeback from the Denver Nuggets to emerge with a 123-120 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naji Marshall top-scored for the Mavs, off the bench, with 26 points, while PJ Washington put up 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic had a triple-double, top-scoring for Denver with 33 points along with 17 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas had a 24-point lead early in the third but Denver battled back and DeAndre Jordan's alley oop dunk shot made it a two-point game with 8:47 left in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Gafford's two-point shot levelled the game 108-108 with 5:13 remaining and it was nip and tuck all the way down the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Denver down a point and just four seconds left on the clock, Jamal Murray tried to hit the rim with his second free throw but inadvertently found the basket and two free throws from Washington sealed the win for Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all stepped up at the right time and we gutted out this win," said Mavs point guard Kyrie Irving, who said the team had shown the right attitude without Doncic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is next-man-up mentality and we've got to do our best to find that rhythm. Consistently feed each other that confidence, especially in tough environments like this. We had to will ourselves to this win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philadelphia 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 113-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared McCain scored 30 points and Tyrese Maxey 26 as the 76ers coped without the injured Joel Embiid and Paul George.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Johnson top-scored for the Nets with 37 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 30 points for the Golden State Warriors as they won 112-108 at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of free throws from Draymond Green saw the Warriors over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State's win moves them to 12-3 in the regular season and put them into the quarter-finals of the NBA Cup as they sit on a 3-0 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo produced his second triple-double in four games putting up 37 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Indiana Pacers 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard helped out with 24 points and 12 assists as the Bucks claimed their third straight win and went 2-0 in the NBA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary Trent Jr, off the bench, added 18 points for Milwaukee with his 6-of-10 three-point shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's playing with confidence, walks with confidence, works hard," Antetokounmpo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are the shots he makes in practice and we knew that sooner or later he would make them in games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am happy for him and need him to keep playing with confidence." (AFP)

 Hongkongers were out bright and early on Saturday to celebrate the twin panda cubs' 100 days at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Many donned panda headbands and costumes, while others carried panda toys as they waited to glimpse a broadcast of the cubs on giant LED screens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The older club, weighing 5.3 kilogrammes, was seen lying peacefully in bed, while her little brother, weighing 5.5 kilogrammes, was more lively, patting his sister from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy because Ying Ying and Le Le have been in Hong Kong for a while now and they finally have children, so its a joyous occasion," said a woman surnamed Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman surnamed Law, who carried a large stuffed panda, said she's been looking forward to today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My daughters and I love pandas because they're so pure and well-behaved. That's why I take this stuffed panda with me everywhere I go. I even bring it to dim sum. I love taking photos of pandas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  People were also excited by the reopening of the Giant Panda Adventure facility after two months, which houses the cubs' father, Le Le.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said a lot of publicity has been done in the SAR to promote the pandas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new pandas will be Hong Kong's new tourism ambassadors...in hopes that they will attract more tourists to come," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitors also received red eggs and pork knuckle ginger stew with vinegar at the event - dishes served to celebrate the birth of a baby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Park also said that people can look forward to meeting the two new giant pandas gifted by the Central Government next month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police commissioner Raymond Siu revealed on Saturday that the force made over 90 arrests for offenses related to "space oil" in the first 10 months of this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Space oil is an emerging drug that is usually inhaled through vapes. It often contains etomidate - a part 1 poison that has to be prescribed by a doctor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu told reporters after a passing-out parade that the force is looking to use test strips for detection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the future, when patrolling officers find someone who's suspicious, let's say the person is suspected of taking space oil, we could immediately use test strips to check. We hope that this could have a deterrent effect," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The police chief pointed out that in an operation carried out in Kwai Tsing district related to space oil, all but four of the 17 arrestees were students.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the police will step up education by inviting people who used to take the drug, as well as medical workers, to share the hazards of space oil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is aiming to list space oil as a dangerous drug next year.

    'Two years suitable to comply with new sports rules'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780509_1_20241123114216.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok said that a two-year time frame is suitable for sports bodies to comply with new standards, adding that the National Sports Associations responded positively to the review report and governance code.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China had earlier reviewed the operations and governance of 77 member associations across six key areas - board governance, integrity management, selection of athletes, management of coaches and umpires, administration of membership, and general administration - totalling 243 governance items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, Fok, who is also vice-president of SF&OC, noted that nearly 60 percent of these items have been fully or partially implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that when it comes to selecting athletes, the criteria must be fair, just and open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think past performance or potential should account for the vast majority of the selection process for all athletes. The responsibility of the National Sports Associations is to write down clear requirements. For each competition, what goals do I hope to achieve and what athletes do I hope to select? Performance may account for 60 percent, and there may be other indicators that account for the rest of the percentage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important principle is that the athlete's performance cannot be buried and cannot be prevented by other factors or institutional factors from being able to perform to the best of their abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said that the code of governance recommends that sports bodies implement a maximum tenure and length of term of office an individual may serve on the Board of Directors, adding that the age should not exceed 70 or 75 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each sports association faces different situations. Their initial establishment or stage of development and the level of talent participation in their industry or sports field are different. If there's a hard-and-fast age set, it may not necessarily be the best for the development of the sport so it's important to leave room for flexibility," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SF&OC initiated a review of its governance and operations following a 2020 audit report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body had said that member associations failing to meet the new governance and operational standards in the two-year time frame may face penalties, including reductions in subsidies.

    'Senior staff held more accountable increases morale'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hospital Authority emphasised that its plan to hold senior staff more accountable when medical blunders occur will not demoralise workers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The HA announced earlier that it will set up a high-level reform committee to review the responsibility of staff of all ranks.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after a review committee, which was set up months ago after a series of incidents, found that the duties of staff are not clearly defined.
  <br>
  <br>
  HA chairman Henry Fan told reporters on Saturday after a Commercial Radio programme that he believes the move will not dispirit senior staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're trying to do is to actually build up a more proper governance system and management structure, which will in fact assist our colleagues in performing better for the well-being of our patients, which is what the HA is about. We want to provide the best service and have the confidence of the people of Hong Kong. So, I don't think it will be demoralising," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the contrary, we would do it properly in a sense that we will have consultation before we reach any decision. I think it will, in fact, increase morale."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the reform, the HA officially plans to roll out a reward-and-penalty system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan has more ideas that he believes could be beneficial, such as giving staff a warning letter for a minor medical blunder. If they are involved in two or more incidents, then they would not get a pay rise for a year - but he stressed that these are just his personal views and have not been discussed by the committee yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is one way to hold colleagues accountable. Because we cannot say any time you make a mistake, you're suspended. Nor can we say every time you make a mistake, you only get a letter or a warning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan added that the HA is also considering setting up channels for staff to voice their opinions confidentially.

    Fears for Gaza hospitals as fuel and aid run low

<img alt="Women react after a tent that was sheltering displaced Palestinians was hit in an Israeli strike, west of Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that hospitals have only two days' fuel left before they must restrict services, after the United Nations warned aid delivery to the war-devastated territory is being crippled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warning came a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant more than a year into the Gaza war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN and others have repeatedly decried humanitarian conditions, particularly in northern Gaza, where Israel said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza medics said an overnight Israeli raid on the cities of Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia resulted in dozens killed or missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marwan al-Hams, director of Gaza's field hospitals, told reporters all hospitals in the Palestinian territory "will stop working or reduce their services within 48 hours due to the occupation's (Israel's) obstruction of fuel entry".
  <br>
  <br>
  World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was "deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of 80 patients, including 8 in the intensive care unit" at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of just two partly operating in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late Thursday, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Muhannad Hadi, said, "The delivery of critical aid across Gaza, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies, is grinding to a halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that for more than six weeks, Israeli authorities "have been banning commercial imports" while "a surge in armed looting" has hit aid convoys. (AFP)

<img alt="France's Gabin Villiere scores a second try for the hosts at Stade de France. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780493_1_20241123073337.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France eased to a 37-23 victory over an ill-disciplined Argentina at a bitterly cold Paris in their final game of the November internationals on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus claimed four tries including a superb solo effort from in-form winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey, following on from victories over Japan and New Zealand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three from three during the series makes us happy, it was the objective," Bielle-Biarrey told TF1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan was a little warm-up, then against the All Blacks we fought until the end. We end with three wins and I feel we improved game on game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Pumas had two players shown yellow cards in the first half, captain Julian Montoya and Juan Martin Gonzalez, which led to the hosts leading 30-9 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't start the way we wanted, our discipline wasn't good," Montoya told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What made me proud was we went again until the 80th minute, there's things to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  France coach Fabien Galthie made four changes from last Saturday's nerve-wracking one-point win over New Zealand as Charles Ollivon came in for the dropped Gregory Alldritt at No 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina boss Felipe Contepomi switched his scrum-half giving Gonzalo Garcia a start instead of Gonzalo Bertranou after last Friday's loss to Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the All Blacks, Les Bleus lost prop Tevita Tatafu to an early injury and loose-head Jean-Baptiste Gros suffered a similar fate after four minutes on Friday with a leg problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gros's injury was caused by Montoya's dangerous clean at a ruck and the hooker was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie's side made the extra man count to open the scoring as Antoine Dupont fed lock Thibaud Flament to crash over from short range after a powerful rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Ramos slotted the easy conversion to make it 7-0 after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the half hour mark the hosts lead 13-9 as Ramos traded penalty goals with Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz.
  <br>
  <br>
  France stretched their advantage to 20-9 as winger Gabin Villiere dived over following some dominant forward carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos added the conversion to overtake Dimitri Yachvili in third place on France's scoring charts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things worsened for Contepomi's outfit as they conceded a penalty try with four minutes of the first half to play and had a second player sent to the bin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flanker Gonzalez was shown a yellow card for palming a loose ball into touch after Dupont and Ramos showed their class with delicate chip kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France went into the break 30-9 ahead as Ramos slotted his third penalty of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the interval Galthie brought 20-year-old back-rower Marko Gazzotti on for his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flanker's main intervention was to scramble onto a loose ball three metres from his own line before Les Bleus cleared with Argentina working their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 24 minutes to play they were rewarded as prop Thomas Gallo benefitted from a rolling maul and Albornoz brought the score to 30-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas' comeback hopes were shortlived as Bielle-Biarrey scored his fourth try in three games, showing lightning speed to gather his own grubber kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos converted to make it 37-16 leaving the south Americans, fourth at last year's World Cup, with a mountain to climb in the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deficit was cut once again as Perpignan hooker Ignacio Ruiz, one of 10 French-based players in Argentina's matchday squad, barrelled over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz took the score to 37-23 with his two-pointer with nine minutes to play but it wasn't enough to claim a first win over France in Paris since 2014. (AFP)

    US markets close higher, with Dow hitting new high

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week on a positive note, continuing earlier gains on optimism about the Trump Administration. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780490_1_20241123065830.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to a fresh record on Friday, extending a post-election US equity rally while the euro retreated against the US dollar following weak eurozone data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blue-chip index piled on one percent to end the day at 44,296.51, narrowly overtaking a record set earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose one percent to close at 44,296.51, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,969.34 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to 19,003.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major American indices have been at or near record territory since the US election, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump's programme of tax cuts and regulatory scale-back would more than offset the impact of expected tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trading most of this week has been influenced by the growth agenda," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have been cheered this week by a broadening of the rally beyond the tech names that dominated earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar also continued to strengthen, reflecting less certainty about additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the US currency's status as a haven asset amid escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro was also battered by a closely watched survey showing contractions in November business activity in the eurozone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) published by S&P Global dropped to 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October, the most marked rate of contraction in 10 months. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things could hardly have turned out much worse," said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone's manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the euro fell both Paris and Frankfurt stocks managed to recover their losses and advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone data has increased the chance of more rate cuts from the ECB next year," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as well a cut of 50 basis points next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have been jolted into recalibrating interest rate expectations on the back of this bleak economic news," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  London managed to gain 1.4 percent despite data showing that retail sales figures for October undershot forecasts, as the pound fell against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin set a new record high above US$99,500 on Friday, before easing slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leading digital currency is expected to push through US$100,000 as investors grow increasingly hopeful that Trump will pass measures to deregulate the crypto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared more than 40 percent since the Republican's election victory this month and has more than doubled since the turn of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent surge has also been "driven by news that Trump could set up an official crypto department that would sit in the heart of US government," said XTB's Brooks. (AFP)

 Armed robbers snatched jewels worth millions from a work by famed Parisian goldsmith Joseph Chaumet and classed a national treasure in a brazen heist at a French museum.
 <br>
  <br>
  Motorbike-riding thieves arrived at the Hieron Museum in Paray-le-Monial in central France at around 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three entered the building and one stood guard outside, mayor Jean-Marc Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group fired several shots before heading for the museum's star exhibit, a three-metre work executed in 1904 depicting the life of Christ in precious metals, jewels and ivory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known as "Via Vitae", it is classed as a national treasure by France's culture ministry, with an estimated value of up to seven million euros (US$7.3 million), mayor Nesme said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intruders sawed through the armoured glass protecting the piece with a power tool before snatching gold and ivory figurines as well as emerald decorations from the piece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gigantic piece comprises 138 figures encrusted with diamonds and rubies set in marble of various shades and alabaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they fled on their motorbikes, the gang sowed spikes across the road to hobble two pursuing vehicles, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a great loss for Paray-le-Monial and for national heritage", mayor Nesme said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Staff and around 20 visitors present on the museum's ground floor had been "traumatised" by the violent intrusion, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hieron Museum, one of France's oldest for sacred art, has previously been targeted by thieves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two gold crowns were stolen in 2017, while there was another attempted robbery in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's theft came a day after several precious objects including ornate snuffboxes were stolen from a central Paris museum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad daylight robbery saw thieves break into a display case with axes and baseball bats in full view of visitors and staff at the Cognacq-Jay museum. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Holding senior managers at public hospitals accountable for blunders means they have the responsibility to try to prevent them from happening, medical sector lawmaker David Lam said on Friday, after the Hospital Authority vowed to improve its governance and accountability.
 <br>
  <br>
  A review committee put forward more than 30 recommendations to the Hospital Authority, including enhancing top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as defining the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam, a member of the review committee, said strengthening accountability at a higher level meant it won't just be frontline staff taking the blame whenever a medical incident happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That puts a responsibility on the senior management that they have to maintain a low complication rate or a low incident rate in their department. And a way to do so is to make sure the staff are adequately trained and adequately staffed," Lam told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker added it's important to build up a "good portal of communication" among all levels of hospital staff, with the review noting junior employees not always willing to speak up even when they spotted problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The senior staff should start the ball rolling, and encourage the frontline staff or the junior staff to talk to them whenever necessary," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men died in separate industrial accidents in Central and Tung Chung on Friday, sparking fresh calls to protect workers' safety.
 <br>
  <br>
  In one of the cases, an 18-year-old apprentice fell into an escalator shaft during repairs at the Euro Trade Centre on Des Voeux Road Central.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was rescued by firefighters and rushed to Ruttonjee Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fatal work accident occurred at a public housing construction site in Tung Chung, where a 57-year-old painter was believed to be trapped on a spider lift platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was declared dead at North Lantau Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labour Department said it's investigating both tragedies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A workers' rights representative said the occurrence of more industrial accidents serves as a warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said both government and industry need to do more to prevent future incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are heartbroken to hear that workers have passed away. It has only been a little over a week since three workers died from work accidents in five days. This is a huge wake-up call," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People from the industry and government departments need to help think of ways to solve this problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If it is an equipment problem, please improve it immediately. If it involves insufficient training, please strengthen mandatory training as soon as possible."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have approved HK$33.5 billion in funding to help with the abolition of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) offsetting mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mechanism will be scrapped from May 1 next year, and a 25-year subsidy scheme will provide for employers as they adapt to the policy change by sharing the costs associated with severance and long service payments during the transition period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers endorsed the funding request at a Legco Finance Committee meeting on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the government plans to engage a processing agent to assist in the implementation of the subsidy scheme, by facilitating, vetting and approving applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) lawmaker Bill Tang, for his part, said he's concerned that some people may not understand the arrangements well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There may be some cases in future because we know that maybe some employers or even some employees do not understand the arrangement of the cancelling offsetting mechanism... We can foresee some disputes between employees and employers, so the FTU is very concerned about it," Tang said.

    Vegas disaster for Verstappen as team bring wrong wing

<img alt="Senior adviser Helmut Marko says Red Bull are losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight because of the blunder.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen's hopes of clinching a fourth consecutive drivers' world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend took a dent on Friday when Red Bull revealed they had brought the wrong rear wing.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Auto Motor und Sport, the team's senior advisor Helmut Marko said Red Bull were losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight, the Las Vegas Boulevard leading to Caesars Palace, after a packing blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have another rear wing, a smaller rear wing, as we see on our competitors," said Marko. "It would be more helpful, for sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it was too late for the team to arrange for a more appropriate trimmed rear wing to be flown out to Las Vegas before the race on Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen leads McLaren's Lando Norris by 62 points with three races remaining and simply needs to finish ahead of him in Las Vegas to become the sixth man to win four world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, however, struggled in second practice on Thursday night, finishing 17th in slippery conditions on the cold, dry and dusty circuit around the streets of 'Sin City' where the three-time champion won last year's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen tried to make light of the team's error, in packing the wrong rear wing, and blamed his struggle on the slippery conditions and difficulty with tyre temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The issue for us is definitely tyre-related as we have no grip and it feels like driving on ice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We struggled to make the tyres work, especially over one lap and we were quite far off with the pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team-mate Sergio Perez was 19th in the session topped by Mercedes' seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of Norris of McLaren, who said on Wednesday it is "probably too late" to stop Verstappen from taking the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were flashes of speed," said Marko. "We just have to get consistency into it. On the single lap we can improve but on the long run, the tyre wear is a problem at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that conditions may change in favour of Red Bull before the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow is a different day," he said. "You see it a lot of times. People will be fastest on Friday, or Thursday, but it doesn't mean that they are fast in the race. We will, for sure, make a reasonable step." (AFP)

    COP29 draft proposes rich nations pay US$250bn a year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A new draft of a global climate agreement released on Friday at COP29 in Azerbaijan proposes that developed countries provide US$250 billion annually by 2035 to help poorer countries fight global warming.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time a concrete number has been formally proposed at the UN climate talks in Baku, and comes on the final day of a summit dominated by divisions over money.
  <br>
  <br>
  The text sets an ambitious overall target to raise a total of US$1.3 trillion a year by 2035, with the money from rich governments at the core of funding that would be coupled with private-sector investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nearly 200 nations at COP29 had struggled to agree on a new goal that boosted assistance for developing nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The existing pledge committed wealthy nations most responsible historically for global warming to provide US$100 billion a year in climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  An influential negotiation bloc of 134 developing nations including China has demanded at least five times that figure from developed countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major contributors such as the European Union had said such demands were politically unrealistic and that private-sector money must play a large part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries have also pushed at COP29 for a redoubling of efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, something opposed by the Arab Group of nations which does not want fossil fuels singled out. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian authorities said on Friday they had seized almost five tonnes of cocaine stashed in shipping containers at Antwerp port, as part of a cross-border investigation into a drug trafficking ring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said eight people were detained following searches carried out in Belgium and the Netherlands earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The inspections led to the seizure of 185,000 euros (US$193,000) in cash as well as weapons, jewellery, luxury handbags, watches and 4.78 tonnes of cocaine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe focused on a criminal organisation involved in trafficking cocaine to Belgium from South America, Central America and Canada, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group allegedly facilitated the clearing of suspicious containers in the port of Antwerp and, in return for payment, provided logistical assistance to other organisations, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antwerp's port is one of the major gateways for drugs smuggled from South America to the European market, and busts in and around the vast facility occur frequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cocaine seizures there hit a record 116 tonnes last year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell on Friday shot a five-under 65 to surge to the top of the leaderboard at the Hong Kong Open, putting the defending champion one shot ahead of Thailand's Nitithorn Thippong as the competition entered the halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a dominant display for Campbell, 33, who took advantage of his familiarity with the course in Fanling to outperform his group comprising South Korean phenom Tom Kim and American Peter Uihlein under sunny and bright conditions, a far-cry from Thursday's wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell had a two-day total of 12-under 128, overtaking opening round leader Nitithorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – Australian Kevin Yuan, Kazuki Higa of Japan and Yongjun Bae of South Korea, who had the day's best score of 62 – were tied for third at 9-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho moved up the leaderboard in his bid to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China star had another solid outing with a round of five-under 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho and four others were tied for sixth at eight under at the end of round two, four shots behind Campbell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim and Uihlein, meanwhile, were among those missing the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today gave me a lot of confidence and proved what I was doing was working," Campbell told reporters after his strong performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think being out on LIV as a reserve this year really helped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being around some of the best players in the world, seeing what they do, allowed me to back up the things I've learned from the team around me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell also spoke about what it meant to be competing in the SAR again, as he looks to defend his title and add a second Asian Tour title to his resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've found a swing that my body seems to like a lot more," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning here last year was massive. It's always nice to come back to a golf course you really like and feel comfortable on, so it's definitely great to be back here again."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's hospital bosses have vowed to clarify the responsibility of staff of all ranks and strengthen accountability of senior management when it comes to medical incidents, after a review committee found the roles of workers are not clearly established.
 <br>
  <br>
  Instructed by the administration following a string of medial blunders, the Hospital Authority (HA) set up a review committee a few months ago to look into the operations and management of public hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among 31 recommendations put forward to the authority, the review committee suggested public hospitals enhance top-level oversight for quality and safety issues, as well as define the roles, responsibilities and authority at various levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HA said it would look into introducing a reward-and-penalty system when assessing staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's important to more clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each of the staff at different levels," said HA chief executive Tony Ko on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The committee also recommend that in terms of the performance assessment of individual staff, we have to put into elements of quality and safety. So we'll be more explicit in terms of the performance assessment of the individual staff to see how they can reflect in part of the performance and obviously subsequently will be related to the accountability issues."
  <br>
  <br>
  The review committee noted that junior hospital staff often have a strong sense of hierarchy, stopping them from speaking up even when they spotted problems before incidents eventually happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Younger and less experienced staff members lacked enough training and were not too familiar with safety culture, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A high-level reform committee, to be led by HA chairman Henry Fan, will be formed. The permanent secretary for health and the under secretary will join the committee, to give timely policy directions and guidance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said the group will focus solely on improving governance and accountability, while other issues would be worked on as quickly as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, having said that, there are some issues, for example the recommendation that we should change the culture of HA, which would probably take some time," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Culture, by definition, is deep-rooted, and we can't expect to change that overnight. So we will do our best. But what we want is to try to make changes as quickly as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other recommendations include strengthening clinical mentorship and supervision, and encouraging staff to report incidents.

    Bus fare increase requests opposed by lawmakers

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some lawmakers attending a Legco transport panel meeting on Friday voiced their opposition to fare increase applications made by franchised bus operators.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) and New Lantao Bus want to put fares up by 6.5 percent, while Citybus is seeking 9.5 percent increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  KMB told lawmakers it needs to charge more because the expansion of the MTR network is having an "irreversible" impact on its finances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's finance director, Joseph Leung, said average daily passenger numbers are down nine percent compared to 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is due to changes in economic cycle, ageing population, as well as a change in people's commuting patterns, and people are going out less during weekends and at night," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing an expansion of the railway system, including the Tuen Ma Line as well as the East Rail Line. We see a loss of 130,000 passengers every day. The further expansion of the railway system will hit the bus operators and these conditions are irreversible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang was among those criticising the fare increase applications. But he backed a Citybus plan to roll out a loyalty programme for customers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes it will cover journeys between Tin Shui Wai and Hong Kong Island as bus fares are more expensive than the MTR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for journeys from Tin Shui Wai North to Hong Kong Island, actually Citybus has the advantage. Because compared to the railway, Citybus routes are faster and more convenient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the problem is that these routes are too expensive even when passengers interchange to trains. Therefore, if there are such loyalty programmes, I believe it will encourage commuters to choose to take buses."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country's biggest internet forum concluded its four-day session in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Friday, with more than 1,800 guests from over 130 countries taking part.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech representatives and government ministers meet annually in the town for the World Internet Conference, which focused this year on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the conference, the World Internet Development report 2024 was issued, reviewing China’s internet development over the past three decades and projecting future directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the evolution of global cyberspace governance and stressed the need for international consensus on AI and data issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some attendees about what they hoped the summit will achieve.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the participants, City University’s deputy president Ray Cheung, said he wants more teaching collaboration within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “City University already established our Dongguan campus and 80 percent of the faculty that are teaching courses in Dongguan is actually coming from Hong Kong. So what we are seeing is a lot of synergies actually developing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we see Hong Kong as the global international education hub is taking a very important role for the GBA as well as the global education development.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Stanford neuroscientist and researcher Walter Greenleaf, said he hope to see some agreements to address looming healthcare crises after the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned from the pandemic that what happens in one spot can impact another spot. So I think as healthcare providers, as developers of healthcare technology, we need to transcend borders and just make sure that we realise that as people, as part of the world, we are in a great position to help each other."
