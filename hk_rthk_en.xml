<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has moved quickly to staff his incoming administration, naming loyalists to several key posts within days of his election victory and signalling his desire to have some seated without a Senate confirmation process.
 <br>
  <br>
  The staffing picks are the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny, with Trump vowing that his second administration will oversee a radical shake-up of the federal government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old Republican tycoon said Sunday he would tap hardline immigration official Tom Homan as the country's "border czar," while US media reported the nod for UN ambassador as going to New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a vocal Trump ally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Miller, another fierce critic of illegal immigration who served in Trump's first administration, has been tapped for deputy chief of staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The picks signal movement on a number of Trump's key campaign messages, with Homan's hardline immigration stance making him a loyal hand in carrying out the incoming president's deportation promises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik, who has voiced strong support for Israel, will represent the administration as the UN grapples with the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefanik's nomination would need approval by the Senate, but Trump is hoping to bypass Congress by making appointments while the chamber is in recess.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump will not be inaugurated until January, and had previously made one cabinet-level appointment, naming his campaign manager Susie Wiles as his White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. (AFP)

    Japan's re-elected PM Ishiba vows to step up reform

<img alt="Speaking at a press briefing in Tokyo, Shigeru Ishiba vowed to transform the ruling party. Photo: AP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778607_1_20241112044832.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to take tougher measures against misuse of political funds after he was re-elected by parliament on Monday following a major loss in the polls last month by his governing coalition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior partner Komeito together lost a majority in the 465-seat Lower House, the more powerful of Japan’s two-house parliament, in the October 27 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was blamed on voter outrage over financial misconduct by his party.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must remind ourselves of the basics that politics is for the people, as we tackle political and party reforms," Ishiba said. He said that in response to the poor election results, "We must be able to have empathy for the pain, sorrow and anger of the people.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A special parliamentary session convened on Monday to pick a new leader in a vote required within 30 days of a general election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba beat top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda 221-160 in the first runoff in 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his second Cabinet in just over a month, Ishiba reappointed most of its previous members, including Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaced three ministers who lost seats or were affected by the election results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba stressed the importance of pursuing the significant buildup of Japan's defence power.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he plans to attend Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and Group of 20 summits later this month to strengthen partnership with the Global South nations and the Asia-Pacific region. He said he will hold talks with US President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  His government is also reportedly arranging a possible meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. (AP)

 US main indexes closed at new records highs on Monday, lifted by stocks expected to benefit from Republican President-elect Donald Trump's potential fiscal policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tesla's stock market value surged 9 percent to over US$1.1 trillion, fuelled by bets the auto-maker will benefit from CEO Elon Musk's close ties to Trump.

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778583_1_20241111213136.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

 Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler on Monday called on Israel to respect Iran's sovereignty and refrain from attacking Iranian soil, highlighting warming ties between the Middle East rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told a summit of Arab and Muslim leaders that the international community should oblige Israel "to respect the sovereignty of the sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran and not to violate its lands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Opening the summit, he said the international community must "immediately halt the Israeli actions against our brothers in Palestine and Lebanon", condemning Israel's campaign in Gaza as "genocide".
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Saudi Arabia) affirms its support for the brothers in Palestine and Lebanon to overcome the disastrous humanitarian consequences of the ongoing Israeli aggression," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draft resolution for the summit stresses "firm support" for "national rights" for the Palestinian people, "foremost among which is their right to freedom and to an independent, sovereign state".
  <br>
  <br>
  Just hours earlier, newly appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said it was not "realistic" to establish a Palestinian state, dismissing it as a "Hamas state".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think this position is realistic today and we must be realistic," Saar said in response to a question during an appearance in Jerusalem.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi foreign ministry announced plans for the summit in late October during a meeting, also in Riyadh, of a new "international alliance" to press for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes one year after a similar gathering in Riyadh of the Cairo-based Arab League and the Jeddah-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation during which leaders condemned Israeli forces' actions in Gaza as "barbaric". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Monday that the Standby Signal No 1, which took effect at 10.20pm, will remain in force until at least noon on Tuesday, as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves closer to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forecasters said they'll consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said according to the present forecast track, the storm may be relatively close to the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether a higher Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal will be issued depends on the distance between Toraji and the Pearl River Estuary at that time, its intensity and the change in local wind conditions," the observatory said in its storm warning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said members of the public should be aware of stronger winds and stay away from the shoreline because of swells.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday brought one of the four suspects in a murder case in Tuen Mun to the scene of the crime as part of their investigation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspect, who was handcuffed and wearing a black hood, was taken to Yau Oi Estate Market under police supervision.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, officers arrested four men, aged between 58 and 64, in connection with the death of a 34-year-old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police allege the suspects beat up the victim outside the wet market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later fell unconscious at home and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said preliminary investigations suggested the suspects did not know the victim, and the case did not involve triad activities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real estate and Macau gaming tycoon Lui Che-woo has died at the age of 95, one of his listed firms announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Galaxy Entertainment Group said he passed away peacefully last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Lui's] vision, tremendous leadership and guidance were the foundations for the Group’s development and continued success," the group said in a filing to the stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The board would like to express its deepest sorrow for the passing away of Lui and extends its deepest condolences to his family."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group said it will continue its operations in accordance to the strategies laid down by its board, adding that Lui's passing won't have any impact on how the group is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tycoon made his last public appearance in late September when a host of local celebrities joined him in a party celebrating his birthday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui was also the chairman of the K. Wah Group, a multinational conglomerate he founded in the 1950s, focusing on construction materials and quarry mining.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later expanded his business into real estate investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides various housing and hotel developments in Hong Kong, K. Wah also holds projects in major mainland cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou, as well as Singapore and Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, Lui ventured into Macau's gaming business, winning one of the gambling licences issued by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His group now owns six casinos there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost a decade ago, the businessman founded a prize under his own name, recognising people who have contributed to the world civilisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2012, Lui was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the city's top honour, for his contributions to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had also been a member of the local Election Committee, as well as a member of the national advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lui is survived by his wife and five children.

    China announces anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Monday announced it will impose temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports from the European Union (EU).
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said the decision follows a preliminary investigation that found EU brandy producers were dumping certain products in China, threatening to cause substantial damage to the domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Importers of brandy originating in the EU must place deposits with Chinese customs based on dumping margins of between 30.6 percent and 39 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures apply to grape-based spirits in containers less than 200 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures follow a similar announcement made by the ministry on October 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether these measures – which will come into effect on Friday – were new or an extension of existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Europe's leading producer of brandy, had described the measures announced last month as political after the EU imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles over unfair competition claims. (Xinhua/AFP)

    UN climate talks off to rocky start

<img alt="COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev addresses the opening of the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference in 
Azerbaijan. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778581_1_20241111212523.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The COP29 talks opened on Monday with calls for global cooperation and fresh warnings about climate disasters, but proceedings quickly ground to a halt in a fight over the agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donald Trump's re-election is already hanging over the talks in Baku where negotiators are meant to agree new funding for climate action in poorer countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they opened, UN climate chief Simon Stiell told countries: "Now is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count."
  <br>
  <br>
  And he warned rich countries struggling to agree a new funding target to "dispense with any idea that climate finance is charity."
  <br>
  <br>
  "An ambitious new climate finance goal is entirely in the self-interest of every nation, including the largest and wealthiest."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the official proceedings in the capital of oil- and gas-rich Azerbaijan stalled almost immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're not going to resume until they resolve... the agenda," said Alden Meyer, senior associate at climate change think tank E3G.
  <br>
  <br>
  The COP29 president "can't put negotiating teams to work" until they adopt it, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators must increase a US$100 billion-a-year target to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.
  <br>
  <br>
  How much will be on offer, who will pay, and who can access the funds are some of the major points of contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries are pushing for trillions of dollars and insist money should be mostly grants rather than loans, but negotiators are tight-lipped over what final figure might emerge.
  <br>
  <br>
  COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev acknowledged the need was "in the trillions" but said a more "realistic goal" was somewhere in the hundreds of billions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These negotiations are complex and difficult," the former executive of Azerbaijan's national oil company said at the opening of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Developing countries warn that without adequate finance, they will struggle to offer ambitious updates to their climate goals, which countries are required to submit by early next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global North owes the global South a climate debt," said Tasneem Essop, executive director of Climate Action Network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not leave this COP if the ambition level on the finance... doesn't match the scale at which finance must be delivered."
  <br>
  <br>
  The small group of developed countries that currently contributes the money wants the donor pool expanded to include other rich nations and top emitters, including China and the Gulf states.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is firmly rejected by Beijing, with one Chinese official warning on Sunday during a closed-door session that the talks should not aim to "re-negotiate" existing agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a handful of leaders from the Group of 20, whose countries account for nearly 80 percent of global emissions, are attending. US President Joe Biden is staying away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan will however be sending a delegation for the first time since the Taliban took power. They are expected to have observer status.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diplomats have insisted that the absences, and Trump's win, will not detract from the serious work at hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come with fresh warnings that the world is far off track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The UN said Monday that 2024 is on track to break new temperature records, and the Paris climate agreement's goals were now "in great peril".
  <br>
  <br>
  The period from 2015 to 2024 will also be the warmest decade ever recorded, the UN's World Meteorological Organization said in a new report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The climate deal commits to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels, preferably below 1.5C.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the world tops that level this year, it would not be an immediate breach of the Paris deal, which measures temperatures over decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it suggests much greater climate action is needed. (AFP)

    'Trump's victory won't diminish Sino-US tensions'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Monday said Donald Trump's victory in the American presidential election will not diminish Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the US-China tension will not change with the new president," Tang told reporters after attending a forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We always wish to cooperate and work with all the people in the world and live peacefully for the benefit of the people. But that’s not how a lot of Americans are thinking, and it is a cross-party interest. So I don’t think the tension will diminish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, I do think, I do hope that Trump will be more a US president as in being a businessman, meaning consider the interest of the people over the interest of who's threatening who."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hong Kong will face a "very challenging" situation due to tensions between China and the US. But the former chief secretary said the SAR has always survived in challenging situations and the city will overcome this time through the collective efforts of everyone in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tang said he believes Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong hopes the local business sector will seek changes through reform and take concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia told the SAR's business community during a closed-door meeting in Shenzhen last Friday that they are the "main force" in promoting the SAR's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hongkongers are always very patriotic and "very astute businessmen".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course support the Central People's Government and we are always supporters of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Xia Baolong. So, I'm sure all of those who went [to the meeting] will take his advice to heart and consider their actions and how to demonstrate that they have actually put into concrete action their support for the government and for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said both government and business have to work together to boost economic development.

 The observatory on Monday said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued at 10.20pm as Tropical Cyclone Toraji moves towards Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The storm has passed over the Philippine island of Luzon and will come within 800 kilometres of the SAR overnight, forecasters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of Toraji and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.

    Parliament re-elects Ishiba as Japan PM in runoff vote

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese lawmakers voted on Monday for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to stay on as leader, after his scandal-tarnished coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a lower house election last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba, who called the snap poll after taking office on October 1, must now run a fragile minority government.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partner Komeito won the biggest bloc of seats in the election but lost the majority held since 2012, leaving him beholden to small opposition parties to pass his policy agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Underlining that fragility, Monday's vote in parliament, broadcast on television, went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, with no candidate able to muster majority support in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ishiba eventually prevailed as expected, garnering 221 votes, well clear of his nearest challenger, ex-PM Yoshihiko Noda, the head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, but still short of a majority in the 465-seat lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan will hold elections next year for the less powerful upper house, where the ruling coalition's slim majority could also be at risk if Ishiba cannot revive public trust roiled by a scandal over unrecorded donations to lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  His imminent challenge is compiling a supplementary budget for the fiscal year through March, under pressure from voters and opposition parties to raise spending on welfare and take steps to offset rising prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  For approval he needs the backing of at least one opposition party, which is most likely to be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) headed by Yuichiro Tamaki.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has held co-operation talks with Ishiba, but DPP lawmakers on Friday did not vote for Ishiba to stay on as prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tamaki is also in a precarious position after admitting on Monday to an extramarital affair revealed in a tabloid magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his premiership confirmed, Ishiba now has to prepare for a slate of international engagements, including a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Brazil on November 18 and 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also trying to arrange a stopover in the United States on the way to or from that gathering to meet Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some Japanese officials fear Trump might again hit Tokyo with protectionist trade measures and revive demands for it to pay more for the cost of stationing US forces there.
  <br>
  <br>
  These issues were largely smoothed over in Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, by the close ties between the president and Japan's then-premier, Shinzo Abe, a bond Ishiba seems keen to re-establish. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said bringing more strategic enterprises to Hong Kong helps the government get closer to the vision of the city becoming an innovation and technology centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief made the comment at a signing ceremony involving the government's Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES) and 17 companies from sectors including life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, fintech, advance manufacturing and new energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the companies in attendance, along with about 50 that got on board earlier, billions of dollars of investment are expected in the coming years, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the first two batches of partners, more than HK$42 billion of investment will be made and over 17,000 jobs will be created in the coming few years. It is particularly heartening to note that about 90 percent of the new batch of enterprises are planning to set up their international or regional headquarters here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said almost all of the enterprises attracted earlier have commenced operations in Hong Kong, and nearly 70 percent have chosen to set up their offices at either the Science Park or Cyberport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prophesee – a French company that builds vision sensors that mimic the way the human eye works – was one of the enterprises that recently signed a partnership with the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO and co-founder Luca Verre said the company has offices in Shanghai, Japan and the US and was thrilled to grow its presence in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because it's a unique hub for the company to address the largest market opportunity for the company, which is the Asia-Pacific market, in particular, the mainland China market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides looking for market growth, Verre also said he's confident that the research capabilities of the city will help in developing the firm's technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always extremely attractive to work with top researchers to push the boundaries of this technology... and actually it turned out that Hong Kong has an incredible ecosystem from that point of view because within a relatively small area, actually the top five universities of Hong Kong are today doing some research related directly or indirectly within neuromorphic technologies," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation, Dennis Lo, on Monday said the body's annual tech awards are paramount for the development of the local science and technology sector and supporting the local economy's transformation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lo, who is a molecular biologist and the incoming head of Chinese University, was speaking as the alliance gave out five awards on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think these young people in innovation and technology are the future of the industry in Hong Kong. Their ability to innovate and passion for research are important in advancing the sector's development for the SAR, and even that for the country," Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope this award can serve as a fuelling station in their marathon career in innovation and technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo expressed hope that the awards will bring the scientists more resources and support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty, won in the artificial intelligence and robotics category, while Ng Siew-chien, Chinese University's medical school assistant dean, took home the prize in life and health.
  <br>
  <br>
  Professor Chen Shih-chi from Chinese University's mechanical and automation engineering department won the prize in advanced manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The award for new materials and new energy went to City University chemistry professor Zhang Hua, while City University computer science scholar Wang Cong grabbed the fintech award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners also received HK$2 million each as part of their prizes.

    People urged to watch out for online investment fraud

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday urged people to think twice before turning to social media or web forums for financial advice after the force recorded around 3,500 cases of online investment fraud in the first nine months of the year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officers said the losses reported reached HK$2.2 billion in total, although both the amount of money swindled and the number of cases dropped by around 20 percent compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior Inspector Wan Pik-yee said there is a rising trend of fraudsters pretending to be police officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They opened some WhatsApp groups using our logo as their profile picture to persuade the victims to believe that they are really police officers and ask them to provide some bank account details to scam their money," Wan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Yeung, head of investor education and stakeholder engagements at the Investor and Financial Education Council said more people have been scammed this year after falling for fake adverts online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Listening or looking into the advice that is given on social media, I don't think there's anything wrong. But when it comes to asking you to join a group or click on any links, that's when it's really a problem," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So with whatever information that we get from the social media or from online, it's always worth to look into alternative sources just to verify whether that information is for real."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's much-anticipated J-35A stealth aircraft is set to make its debut on Tuesday at the country's biggest civil and military air show - the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stealth fighter jet made its first public appearance on Friday, with broadcaster CCTV saying the jet appeared over the Zhuhai Jinwan Airport and conducted its first field adaptation training.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the centrepiece of this week's Zhuhai air show, which also marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).
  <br>
  <br>
  It will include a flying display. Another variant, the J-35, is designed for use with China's aircraft carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35 and J-35A are designed and built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Daily news outlet said ahead of the air show that the J-35A "mainly carries out the task of seizing and maintaining air supremacy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both J-35 variants are considerably smaller than China's other stealth aircraft, the land-based J-20 fighter. An estimated 200 J-20s are operational with the PLAAF.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35A is superficially similar to the Lockheed Martin F-35, whose shape - from fuselage to control surfaces - is designed to minimise how large it appears on radar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition takes place in Zhuhai from November 12-17. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday called on the business sector and entrepreneurs to actively contribute to Hong Kong's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum, the SAR leader said businesspeople should take action to build up their industries, not stand idly by.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The business sector and entrepreneurs in Hong Kong are both participants in and beneficiaries of Hong Kong's development. They should be contributors rather than bystanders. They shouldn't just be commentators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In economic transitions, every industry in Hong Kong should start with themselves, taking actions to grasp opportunities for transformation, building Hong Kong with concrete actions, to develop and construct the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said his administration will transform the power of patriotism into concrete action to ensure long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the government will continue to tackle obstacles and be innovative, and will make use of Hong Kong's advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has to expand its global network to tell good stories of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he hopes society and professional media practitioners will promote the region's advantages, achievements and opportunities to the world.

    Think tank suggests regular youth uniformed group day

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A youth think tank on Monday called on the government to regularly hold a “youth uniformed group day” to raise awareness and break stereotypes about such groups.
 <br>
  <br>
  Youth I.D.E.A.S, under the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, said it recently surveyed 1,001 people aged 12 to 26 and most respondents said they believe joining a uniformed group helps improve teamwork, discipline and a sense of responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The survey also found that almost 55 percent of the respondents were current or former members of a uniformed group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who had never joined a uniformed group, the main reasons cited were that they participated in other extracurricular activities, were worried about the time commitment or felt that it wasn’t required by their schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kelly Cheng from the think tank said many people have a limited understanding of uniformed groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So they may not encourage their children to join the uniformed groups, but we think it will be important to have different channels for youngsters to explore their potential. So one of our suggestions would be to have a regular uniformed group day so as to let the public know more of what exactly the uniformed groups can serve and can connect to a community,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said a regular uniformed group day would also give young people a chance to serve the community and utilise their skills, such as teaching people about first aid and sharing health tips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong has 19 community and government youth uniformed groups with about 280,000 members between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said in its Youth Development Blueprint two years ago that it planned to get more young people to join such groups.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    'Step up training on use of cage lifts in emergencies'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group for industrial accident victims on Monday stressed it is crucial to step up workers' training on the use of cage lifts in emergency situation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Siu Sin-man from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims made the comment on an RTHK radio programme. This came as a worker lost his life after he was crushed by a cage lift at The Pavilia Farm construction site in Tai Wai on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even experienced operators use different kinds of machines at different construction sites. When they're working at a new construction site, or when they have to use a new model of the equipment, they should receive training from scratch," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from training workers in how to operate the equipment, I believe it's more important that they know how to stop the machine in emergencies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Kwong-sing, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner's Education and Training Committee, said on the same programme it is rare for interlocking device at cage lifts to malfunction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we are carrying out safety checks at construction sites, we found out that for convenience, a lot of workers would jam up the safety lock. I've even seen some workers tamper with the control box, causing the safety installation to become useless."
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident was the third fatal industrial accident in five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man succumbed to his injuries after he fell from height at a construction site at the airport last Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old victim is believed to be from the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siu pointed out that the industry has to strengthen communication with workers from the mainland, even if they have relevant experience before coming to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a totally different culture in Hong Kong - whether it's the mode of communication or jargon - they are very different. Training has to be stepped up in advance and ensure that mainland workers understand the instructions and are clear about the working procedures."

 The Observatory said the Standby Signal No 1 will be issued between 8pm and midnight on Monday as a typhoon is about to enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory also said it will consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No 3 between later Tuesday and early Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 1pm, Toraji was centred about 250 kilometres north of Manila and was forecast to move west-northwest at about 18 kilometres per hour across Luzon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Toraji will move towards the vicinity of the western coast of Guangdong to the Pearl River Estuary in the next couple of days," the Observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters added that the storm could be relatively close to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary on Thursday, but may also weaken at the same time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the combined effect of the storm and the northeast monsoon, winds over the region will gradually strengthen with squally showers.

    EOC not doing enough in discrimination cases: Unison

<img alt="Hong Kong Unison's executive director, John Tse, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but people were still being denied service because of their disabilities. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778471_2_20241111085418.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A group advocating racial equality said on Monday that an incident in which a woman was denied service in a restaurant last week because of her wheelchair showed that Hongkongers needed more education on the issue, and accused the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) of not doing enough to help victims of such incidents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The wheelchair incident involving Paralympics double gold medallist Ho Yuen-kei has turned the spotlight on the SAR's treatment of the disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Tse, the executive director of Hong Kong Unison, said anti-discrimination laws had been passed in 1995, but these problems kept cropping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirty years later we still have this kind of discrimination happening in Hong Kong and it's totally unacceptable," Tse told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tse said the EOC had to do more to promote and educate HongKongers and keep them informed of any action that it took after such incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the catering sector drew fire after last week's incident, Tse said these problems weren't limited to restaurants.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a separate incident earlier this year in which two visually disabled people were forced to leave a flight in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No action was ever taken. The two people complained to the EOC. What did they do? Well, nothing much, they just dismissed it," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi's goal of winning the MLS Cup title came to an abrupt end on Saturday with his Inter Miami suffering a shock first-round elimination from the playoffs after a 3-2 home defeat to Atlanta United FC.
 <br>
  <br>
  Miami had won the regular season campaign with a record points total but after losing twice in the best-of-three series, the MLS Cup favourites and their eight-times Ballon d'Or winner are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the accolades Miami received for their regular season 'Supporters' Shield' triumph count for little after an Atlanta team which finished ninth in the Eastern Conference pulled off a stunning upset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter took the lead in the 17th minute when Messi was denied by a diving save from Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan but Matías Rojas followed in to slot home the loose ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Messi who finally broke through in the 65th minute, meeting a Marcelo Weigandt cross from the right with a thundering header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami pushed forward in search of the winner but instead they were caught out once again with Pedro Amador's cross from the left headed home at the back post by Polish midfielder Bartosz Slisz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter players were furious that the referee had allowed play to continue while their defender Tomás Avilés lay injured on the floor but their frustration was in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final whistle brought a deflated silence over Chase Stadium as Miami's season, which so many had expected would end with their first MLS Cup title, concluded with the sight of Guzan and his Atlanta team-mates celebrating.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Miami head coach Gerardo Martino, who won MLS Cup with Atlanta in 2018, an inquest is sure to follow but he tried to put a brave face on the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season has had good and bad things. If you think about where we were in November last year, there has obviously been progress in terms of the club, not just the team," he said. "If you think about the expectations we had for this playoffs, obviously we came up a little short," said the Argentine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martino said there was a despondent mood in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are sad, as they should be when there are so many expectations and the team can't fulfil them," he added. "In this final part of the year we got used to achieving the objectives but we couldn't achieve the most important one." (AFP)

    Chiefs escape Broncos to remain unbeaten on season

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten start to the NFL season after blocking a last-gasp field goal to snatch a dramatic 16-14 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reigning Super Bowl champions looked poised to suffer their first defeat of the campaign after rookie Broncos quarterback Bo Nix expertly engineered a late fourth-quarter drive to the Kansas City 17-yard line.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left Wil Lutz with what should have been a straightforward 35-yard chip shot to win the game with the final kick of an absorbing clash at Arrowhead Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lutz and the Broncos were left stunned after Chiefs' defensive end Mike Danna got a hand to the kick to block the attempt and leave Kansas City exhaling a collective sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes raced across the field in celebration with his teammates as Kansas City sealed a win that sees them improve to 9-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just speaks to this entire team," Mahomes said of Kansas City's great escape. "I felt offensively we didn't do enough. Defensively we stepped it up in the second half, and then special teams – we're a full team. It's everybody, it was a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody believes, no one has any doubts, we just keep pushing and we found a way in the end," the 29-year-old Mahomes added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was hard on Broncos signal-caller Nix, who had shown superb composure throughout to help Denver take a 14-3 second quarter lead thanks to touchdown passes wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Courtland Sutton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's defense, meanwhile, gave Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a torrid time, sacking the Kansas City quarterback four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes, though, gradually got his team back into the game, connecting with Travis Kelce for a touchdown that made it 14-10 at the half, before two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half gave them a slender 16-14 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nix then appeared to have done enough to give Denver a chance at winning the game, only for the blocked field goal drama to deny the Broncos a famous win. (AFP)

    Man Utd win to end Van Nistelrooy's interim tenure

<img alt="Van Nistelrooy celebrates on pitch after the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778469_1_20241111083242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy said his four games as interim manager of Manchester United was a "short but amazing period" after ending his run unbeaten with a 3-0 victory over Leicester on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, who remains a legend at Old Trafford for his goal return during a glorious playing career, also oversaw victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League either side of a 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim will be in charge when the Red Devils next take the field away to Ipswich in two weeks' time, with Van Nistelrooy's own future still unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did a good job," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period," he added. "We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs, and help the club which is important."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment," he went on to say. "To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes continued his scoring streak under Van Nistelrooy with a powerful effort for his fourth goal in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his 250th appearance for the club, Fernandes also had a hand in the second goal as his header was deflected into his own net by Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho then came off the bench to rifle in a brilliant third goal as United shrugged off their problems in front of goal so far this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils remain down in 13th in the Premier League table but are only four points adrift of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy returned to the club where he scored 150 goals in June as an assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision is yet to be made over whether he will have a role in Amorim's coaching team but the 48-year-old is proud of the work he has done in recent weeks to stabilise the club in troubled times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We tried to stabilise after a difficult and emotional period. We wanted to get players performing at their best, we got the right feeling to them and got them believing in themselves," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This spell was a big responsibility, and I took it very seriously," Van Nistelrooy went on to say. "I wanted to help and get United into a better place – that was my goal. With three wins and a draw it's a standard where you want to grow to as a club." (AFP)

    Arsenal draw with Chelsea, Ipswich stun Spurs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal and Chelsea are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their 1-1 draw on Sunday, while Ipswich stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League victory in 22 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are now winless in four Premier League games, as their bid for a first title since 2004 is at risk of unravelling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners welcomed captain Martin Odegaard back to the starting line-up for the first time in two months and were much improved at Stamford Bridge, but still could not come away with a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very unlucky. We have dominated one of the best teams in Europe but we don't get the results – that is what is missing," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after the derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard teed up Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring with a near-post shot on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea responded through Pedro Neto's brilliant long-range effort for his first league goal since a US$66 million move from Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has two new worries to add to what he describes as a nightmare run of injuries, after Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice both failed to finish the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice went off after 71 minutes, and Saka was replaced 10 minutes later with both sustaining knocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good because for two players of that importance to say they want to come off is unusual," Arteta told reporters. "I don't expect them to be fit for the international break."
  <br>
  <br>
  A share of the spoils sees the Blues remain ahead of Arsenal on goal difference as both sides move into the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ipswich will play host to Ruben Amorim's first match as Manchester United manager in two weeks, and go into that game buoyed by their first win since ending a two-decade wait to return to the top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive moment – one to cherish," said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sammie Szmodics took advantage of statuesque Tottenham defending to open the scoring with an overhead kick on 31 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liam Delap doubled the visitors' lead in far less spectacular fashion as he lashed in from point-blank range after Radu Dragusin directed a cross towards his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs had come back to win in eight of the previous 12 league matches they conceded first at home this year but this time left themselves with too much to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Bentancur reduced the arrears with a powerful header from Pedro Porro's corner but they fell to a fifth league defeat in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>

    Sinner beats De Minaur in ATP Finals opener

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner got his bid for a first ATP Finals title underway with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur on Sunday as former champion Daniil Medvedev lost his head during his defeat to Taylor Fritz.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner delighted supporters in Turin with a comfortable win over Finals debutant De Minaur to move first in the Ilie Nastase Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one, who hadn't played since winning the Shanghai Masters last month, only had one brief scare when his serve was broken early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he quickly recovered to rattle off four straight games and take the opening set to 5-2 before closing it out with his first set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner closed out a routine victory in emphatic fashion with a perfect service game and basked in the applause of his home fans after smashing an ace to finish in style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner, who lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, tops the world rankings after a stunning season in which he claimed the Australian and US Opens – his first Grand Slam victories – and won five more ATP titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, world number four Daniil Medvedev boiled with anger during his 6-4, 6-3 loss to American Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev destroyed his racket after going a set down and things went from bad to worse when Fritz broke serve to take a 4-2 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev was docked a penalty point for throwing his racket at a courtside microphone and during game seven of the second set he held a new racket by its head while waiting for Fritz's serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the match Medvedev, whose behaviour was jeered by the crowd, replied "100 percent" when asked if he was hoping for the end of the season to come along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired to fight against something that doesn't depend on myself," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll see how it goes," he added. "Today actually I had my chances. I'll have them the next matches – if it doesn't work out, I go on holiday. I'm happy." (AFP)

    HK eyeing free trade agreement with Peru: TDC

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government is looking to finalise a free trade agreement with Peru, as Chief Executive John Lee heads to the South American nation to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ meeting this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Trade Development Council (TDC) also hopes a brand new port near the Peruvian capital of Lima will provide fresh impetus for cargo trade between the two regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Peru is Hong Kong’s fifth largest trading partner in Latin America, with over HK$5 billion worth of merchandise trade last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Latin American nations are rich in natural resources, they rely heavily on imports for some daily necessities such as clothing and household appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economist Alice Tsang, who leads the global research team at TDC, expects more Hong Kong businesses to tap into the Peruvian market once a free trade agreement is signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From what we see in Peru, there is room to further boost spending among general consumers. After the Covid pandemic, there is demand for high-end products,” she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang added that Peruvian department stores have been sourcing products in Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asia. Some develop their in-house brands whose products are manufactured by SAR companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A free trade agreement can facilitate these exchanges by spelling out the legal framework and government regulations. I believe more Hong Kong companies will be willing to tap into this emerging market,” she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a 2022 document published by the Trade and Industry Department, the proposed free trade agreement seeks to eliminate or reduce tariffs, facilitate customs procedures, as well as improve market access for both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner globally, with bilateral trade reaching some US$37 billion last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a massive Pacific coastline, Peru’s strategic importance in cargo trade was recognised by China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO, a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major undertaking, the firm in 2021 began the construction of Chankay port, located around 80km north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once a remote fishing village, Chankay has been transformed into a natural deep-water port and could serve as a crucial gateway for shipments in and out of Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port began its soft launch this month, and a massive container ship was docked there during a visit by RTHK on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang explained that once the port becomes operational, the shipment time between Shanghai and Peru can be slashed by one week. The time savings also translate to a one-third reduction in operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The cooperation between China and Peru is mutually beneficial. Many consumer goods in Peru arrive from China and Asia. Following the construction of Chankay port, a container ship will be able to reach Peru from Shanghai in 28 days, down from the current 35 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That reduces costs by more than 30 percent, because less fuel is used and the insurance would be cheaper due to less time spent at sea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist believes the project may not be necessarily linked to the trade tensions between China and the United States. She explained that after Covid, nations around the world realised the need to diversify supply chains to reduce risks and minimise disruptions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level." (Reuters)

    Russia, Ukraine exchange massive drone attacks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring a woman and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, while a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine, officials reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  A top UK defence official meanwhile said that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since their full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief of the UK defence staff, Tony Radakin, said Moscow’s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded “every single day,” bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's defence ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying “an extraordinary price" for the war, even as a gruelling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said the losses were for “tiny increments of land,” and that Moscow's mounting defence and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for “as long as it takes” to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of US President-elect Donald Trump have signalled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following “human wave” attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a “record” 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine’s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were “lost”, the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine’s southern port of Odesa, local Governor Oleh Kiper reported. (AP)

    Dozens dead in Israeli strikes on Gaza, Lebanon

<img alt="The first strike early on Sunday completely demolished a house in Jabalia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778426_1_20241110192106.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel launched deadly strikes on Gaza and Lebanon on Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rescuers in Gaza on Sunday said 30 people, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first strike early on Sunday hit a house in Jabalia, killing "at least 25" people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, the Palestinian territory's civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations has described the area as under "siege" and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another strike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City killed five people, with others still missing, the civil defence agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A number of civilians are still under the rubble," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israeli military said it was "looking into the reports" of the strikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lebanon's health ministry, meanwhile, said an Israeli strike on the village of Almat north of Beirut killed at least 20 people including three children on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally of Israeli official figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north toward Lebanon, escalating air strikes and sending in ground troops, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah. The Lebanese group said it was acting in support of Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's main military backer the United States on October 15 warned that it could withhold some of its billions of dollars in military assistance unless Israel improves aid delivery to the Gaza Strip within 30 days – a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at the time that top US officials made "clear to the government of Israel that there are changes that they need to make again to see that the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up from the very, very low levels that it is at today."
  <br>
  <br>
  The demand came before Tuesday's election of President-elect Donald Trump who has promised to give freer rein to Israel.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a UN-backed assessment warned famine is imminent in northern Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter Gaza were now lower than at any time since October 2023, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's military questioned the report's credibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, all assessments by the IPC have proven incorrect and inconsistent with the situation on the ground," a military statement said, denouncing "partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  IPC says its process is "evidence-based" and ensures "a rigorous, neutral analysis."
  <br>
  <br>
  The heads of UN agencies in early November described north Gaza as "under siege" and denied "basic aid and life-saving supplies."
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to use the remaining weeks of his term to press for an end to the Gaza and Lebanon wars, a spokesman said on Thursday, before fellow mediator Qatar on Saturday said it had suspended its role in trying to broker a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Qatar would resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness," Doha's foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said in a statement. (AFP)

    King Charles leads silence for UK war dead

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 King Charles led Britain in two minutes of silence on Sunday to honour the country's war dead at a remembrance service also attended by Catherine, Princess of Wales, as she returns to royal duties after cancer treatment.
 <br>
  <br>
  The king, who was also diagnosed with cancer this year, was among the dignitaries to lay wreaths at the Cenotaph memorial in central London after the nation fell silent at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds lined the Whitehall area of the capital as political leaders including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, current and former members of the armed forces, and war veterans paid their respects to Britons killed in the world wars and other conflicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Catherine, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, watched the ceremony from a government building balcony as she stepped up her return to royal duties since ending chemotherapy in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event came after she smiled and clapped alongside her husband Prince William at the Festival of Remembrance commemorative concert on Saturday night, the first major royal occasion she had attended since her treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The events, two of the most important dates in the royal calendar, marked the first time the princess had carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckingham Palace announced in February that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an undisclosed cancer and would withdraw from public life to undergo treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following month Kate, 42, revealed that she also had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both have since made limited returns to public duties, with Charles recently pausing his treatment while on tour in Australia and Samoa.
  <br>
  <br>
  William said this week that the past year had been "brutal" and probably the "hardest" of his life because of the twin diagnoses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, it's been dreadful," he told reporters on Thursday at the end of a four-day visit to South Africa for his Earthshot prize initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult."
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="Speculators are betting on a Donald Trump presidency giving cryptocurrencies a boost. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778438_1_20241110213830.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as traders bet that Donald Trump's return to the White House will be good for the cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency passed US$80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12:00 pm (1200 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin reached US$75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of US$73,797 achieved in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first presidency, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Cavendish sprinted to one last victory on Sunday as he took the Singapore Criterium in a signature surge to the line.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I really wanted that so bad," the 39-year-old Briton said after his 166th career victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm terribly emotional. I realised in the last five laps that this was the last 15 kilometres of my career. I passed the flamme rouge for the last time in my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming out of the last bend, Cavendish, who holds the record for most stage wins in the Tour de France, briefly latched onto the wheel of defending champion Jasper Philipsen before pulling away. The Manxman had time to glance back before raising his arms in triumph one last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975, having matched the Belgian's mark in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was so on the limit. I didn't race since the Tour de France so I am missing sharpness," said Cavendish who returned to the saddle to finish third in the Saitama Criterium on November 2, clinched by Biniam Girmay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Criterium, organised by the Tour de France, covered 25 laps of a street circuit. Cavendish stayed in the peloton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was nervous about crashing, or something like that; not that there is anything wrong with that but I really wanted to finish," said Cavendish.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he intended to stay involved with cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love this sport. I've always loved it," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Tour de France isn't just a bike race it's the biggest annual sports event in the world, it's what children dream of. It's what adults dream of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling is such a form of freedom. It's a way to be however you want to be. It has so much potential as a sport, as a mode of transport, as a pastime. I will do anything I can to help this move forward." (AFP)

    Philippines to evacuate 2,500 villages ahead of Toraji

<img alt="Severe Tropical Storm Toraji is set to batter parts of the Philippines still reeling from the devastation caused by three huge storms in less than a month. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778429_1_20241110194929.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The residents of 2,500 villages were ordered to evacuate their homes as Severe Tropical Storm Toraji approached the northern Philippines, the government said on Sunday, after three massive cyclones battered the country in less than a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 700,000 people are still sheltering at evacuation centres or with relatives after their homes were destroyed by tropical cyclones Trami, Kong-rey and Yinxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous trio of storms killed 159 people and with Toraji due to make landfall on Monday, people living in 2,500 villages across the northern regions of Ilocos, Cagayan Valley and Cordillera have been ordered to evacuate, Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The soil in those areas is now very saturated and the risk of landslides is very high," Remulla said in a briefing on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot stress it enough, the evacuation orders are important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 110 kilometres per hour, was expected to unleash torrential rains and strong winds when it makes landfall over the northern provinces of Aurora or Isabela, the state weather agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military and police have also prepositioned at least 14 aircraft for rescue and transportation of food in areas that could be isolated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sea travel has also been suspended and dams have started to release water in advance to prevent flooding, Remulla said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toraji's approach has complicated recovery efforts from the three previous storms.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Typhoon Yinxing slammed into the country's north coast. It left a 12-year-old girl dead and damaged houses and buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 51,000 people are still displaced in badly-hit Cagayan province north of Manila, with at least seven of its towns still without power, the provincial disaster agency said in a report on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weeks before that, Severe Tropical Storm Trami and Super Typhoon Kong-rey together left 158 people dead, the national disaster agency said, with most of that tally attributed to Trami.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the archipelago nation or its surrounding waters each year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump has won the presidential election in Arizona, Edison Research projected on Saturday, completing a sweep of all seven battleground states and locking in a decisive Electoral College victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
 <br>
  <br>
  Republican Trump, who had secured the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House by early on Wednesday, now has what is expected to be a final total of 312 votes to Harris' 226.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Arizona, Trump won the swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by winning six of the seven swing states - and narrowly lost North Carolina, winning 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also won 306 in his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump won 74.6 million votes nationwide, or 50.5 percent, to Harris' 70.9 million, or 48 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Congress certifies the Electoral College vote on January 6, Trump and his incoming vice president, US Senator JD Vance, are due to take office on January 20. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of US$10 billion in new deals at a business forum in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo told the China-Indonesia business forum that Jakarta wants to be part of Beijing's emergence as not only an economic but also a "civilisational power".
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration – not confrontation – is the way for peace and prosperity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the forum, Gao Yunlong, chairperson of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push for new achievements in bilateral trade and investment cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides should set an example of win-win cooperation among developing countries, Gao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Indonesia agreed to strengthen cooperation in key sectors, including lithium, new energy vehicles, green energy and tourism, according to a joint statement which was released after a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prabowo on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian leader on Sunday wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to the United States and then to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits. (Agencies)

    Make future shoebox homes bigger: SoCo

<img alt="SoCo calls on the government to add 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778412_1_20241110162312.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community group has suggested that future housing units replacing subdivided homes should be larger than the minimum size proposed by the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his Policy Address in October, Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to eradicate substandard subdivided units and introduce “basic housing units”. The government said each unit must be no less than 8 square metres, or 86 square feet, and have an individual toilet and at least one window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sze Lai-shan, deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation (SoCo), said on Sunday officials should consider adding 5.5 square metres for each additional resident into the basic housing unit requirements, to ensure a suitable environment for families.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If no one cares how many members are in 8 square metres, then it could be three or four people in 8 square metres. That would be too small and too inhumane for them," Sze said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With reference with the standard of public housing, if they are overcrowded, the living space for each person is 5.5 to 7 square metres, they would need to be rehoused to better places by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also suggested the government put together a timetable for legislation, and that residents of cage homes and cubicle apartments could be covered as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while officials have made it clear that those affected by the phasing out of substandard subdivided units would be rehoused, some residents remained jittery.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tenant surnamed Wong, whose unit is regarded as substandard and will be regulated under the new legislation, said he is unsure what will happen next.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only hope for the government to be able to make plans on rehousing arrangements for us. I am happy as long as the rent is not higher than what I am paying now, which is HK$2,890," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cage home tenant, surnamed Fong, who lives in a flat that features 35 bedspaces, called on the government to build more public housing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am now paying a monthly rent of HK$2,700. The Policy Address did not mention cage homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government should speed up rehousing us, and build more public housing for us lower-class people," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoCo also said the government could provide rent or relocation subsidy for residents.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the government's plan to launch a community mediation pilot scheme will resolve conflicts between neighbours, saving both time and money.
 <br>
  <br>
  The idea was unveiled in the Policy Address to promote a culture of mediation through the training of community workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Lam said the pilot scheme can help settle disputes in people's daily lives, such as noise and water leaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In court, there's only one winner, it's like a life-or-death situation, which sometimes isn't the best solution. Both sides might have some valid points, and it's rarely a case of one side being entirely right and the other entirely wrong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mediation saves time while court proceedings are a lengthy process, with significant psychological pressures."
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of efforts to promote mediation to resolve conflicts, the justice chief said last week the government will incorporate mediation clauses in all future government contracts, saying it would save time and reduce costs for all parties involved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Olympic tennis champion Zheng Qinwen narrowly missed the title in her WTA Finals debut, losing to Coco Gauff of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After the two players split the first two sets, Gauff came from 2-0 and 5-3 down in the final set and was two points from defeat at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet she took the set to a tiebreaker and won the first six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng threatened a comeback but Gauff took the victory off her third match point with a forehand winner as she came into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I was like a couple of points away from losing, but I just tried to stay in the moment honestly, and I'm really proud of myself," said Gauff, who's the first American to win the Finals since Serena Williams in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng was looking to complete a season in which she reached a grand slam final for the first time at the Australian Open and delivered China’s first Olympic tennis singles gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The match today, it’s just a couple of important points,” Zheng said. “The match was very close."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added, "And then I had a great season. It's my first time in the WTA Finals. Even though the final did not go in my way, I still got a lot of things to learn." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said Hong Kong can't afford to fall behind the rest of the world in developing a low-altitude economy, adding that the market could exceed HK$1 trillion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Quat, who's also the founding president of the Greater Bay Area Low-Altitude Economy Alliance, said she has met with a government working group on the matter, and the authorities plan to accept applications of pilot projects by the end of this year and unveil them next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that many mainland cities have been developing low-altitude economies for a long time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some food-delivery agencies want to roll this out in Hong Kong, but of course, we have to try it first. They're in discussions with the authorities about where they can test it out. There are also delivery agencies that want to see if they can deliver from one point to another," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some companies are very creative, making drones that can inspect buildings, repair and maintain walls, or even wash windows. In fact, drones can even help with firefighting, rescue work and disaster relief."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that low-altitude services like medicine delivery would be a huge benefit especially for the elderly and those living in outlying islands and village homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the possibility of services outside of Hong Kong, Quat suggested that the government first consider cooperating with Guangdong and Macau to offer helicopter rides for passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said cross-border food delivery won't be feasible because of food-safety concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to general safety concerns, Quat said she thinks drones could be safer than driving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many traffic accidents on the road, and if you are stuck in a traffic jam, you can only move forward, but not backwards. However, if you look at the sky, it's really infinite. You can have many different altitudes," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sky is so big that we can divide it into different heights such as 100 metres, 200 metres and 300 metres to fly different things. There could be different altitudes set for people, cargo, helicopters and rescue. These problems can all be solved technically."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said market sentiment has improved due to declining interest rates and measures to stabilise the economy, despite slower economic growth in the third quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan noted increased transactions in both the stock and property markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect that Hong Kong's economy will continue to maintain momentum for the rest of this year, with the full-year economic growth projected to be close to the lower end of the original forecast range," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 1.8 percent in the three months ending September on a year-on-year basis, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a 3.3 percent growth in the April-to-June period. Officials are forecasting full-year growth of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will sign agreements with 17 more strategic enterprises – from the mainland, the US and Europe – on Monday to establish or expand their businesses here.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies are involved in fields such as AI, big data and new energy, and 90 percent of them plan to set up headquarters in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together with the first two batches of nearly 50 strategic enterprises, Chan said they will bring HK$42 billion in investment to Hong Kong and create more than 17,000 jobs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday, replacing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 as a storm moved away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  At 10am, Severe Typhoon Yinxing was estimated to be around 400 kilometres south-southwest of the SAR and is projected to move slowly towards the seas south of Hainan Island.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said local winds have weakened gradually, and that the Standby Signal No. 1 would be cancelled when Yinxing no longer poses a threat to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the government advised the public to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it'll be mainly cloudy with a few showers at first on Sunday, followed by sunny periods in the next couple of days before the weather becomes unsettled in the middle of the week.

 The Observatory said it would replace the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 with a Standby Signal No. 1 at 10.20am on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement just before 9am, the Observatory said Severe Typhoon Yinxing had continued to weaken in the past two hours, and was gradually moving away from the coast of Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 3.40pm on Saturday, prompting some classes and special programmes to be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Welfare Department advised the public not to take children or family members to centres providing after school care programmes or elderly services centres on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Education Bureau said early on Sunday that kindergarten morning classes and full-day sessions were suspended, along with schools for the physically or intellectually disabled.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, afternoon kindergarten classes will be held as normal.

    Australia upset England with last gasp try

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia coach Joe Schmidt hailed Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii as an "aerial freak" after the cross-code capture marked his first senior game of rugby union by starring in the Wallabies' thrilling 42-37 win over England at Twickenham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Suaalii, a multi million-dollar convert from rugby league, was named player of the match after posing problems for England under the high ball, with the outside centre's sublime pass also sending in full-back Tom Wright for the first of the Wallabies' five tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead changed hands four times late on before, with England 37-35 ahead, Australia replacement back Max Jorgensen went over for the last of the game's 10 tries in the 84th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmidt, reflecting on Suaalii's performance, said: "I thought he was strong. I thought he was really well supported by Lenny Ikitau. Lenny was outstanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joseph obviously got a few kick-offs back for us. He's a bit of an aerial freak, but at the same time, it was a good learning experience for Joseph as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns had been expressed about whether pitching Suaalii into the cauldron of a Twickenham crowd of over 81,000 was a wise move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Schmidt, a former Ireland coach, said: "I know there were some doubts expressed about him being selected and the risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people would now see the opportunity of involving a young man like that, " the New Zealander added.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was only Australia's second victory in 12 games against England and first over their old rivals at Twickenham since they knocked the Red Rose brigade out of the 2015 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also followed a woeful return in this year's southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, where Australia lost five of their six games, and marked an ideal start to their Grand Slam tour, with struggling Wales next up for the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three tries in the last five minutes to win it, lose it and win it, it was so up and down, but one thing that stayed up was the effort from our team," said Schmidt.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Jamie George, meanwhile, said the hosts had produced an "unacceptable" display after they missed 35 tackles against the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was England's fifth straight defeat by a leading rugby nation and followed last week's agonising 24-22 loss to New Zealand in their November opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  England coach Steve Borthwick lamented lost opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a game we should have won. We were in a position to win multiple times," Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you turn over that much ball and make the game that unstructured against a team with that much pace, you're giving them opportunities. We gave them far too many opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, New Zealand ended Ireland's 19-match winning streak at Lansdowne Road, running out 23-13 victors over the world ranked number one side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Argentina launched their November international campaign with a ninth successive victory over Italy, winning 50-18 in Udine, and Antoine Dupont guided France to a 52-12 win over visiting Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, the Springboks play Scotland at Murrayfield, and Wales host Fiji in Cardiff. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat after blowing the lead to lose 2-1 at Brighton, allowing Liverpool to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City had not suffered defeat in the league for nearly a year prior to losing at Bournemouth last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after also exiting the League Cup to Tottenham and being on the end of a 4-1 thrashing by Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola has lost four straight matches for the first time in his illustrious managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions looked set to bounce back from their chastening night in Lisbon on Tuesday when Erling Haaland prodded in his 15th goal of the season at the second attempt after his initial effort was saved by Bart Verbruggen.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, though, were opened up at will in the second half and were finally punished by a pair of Brighton substitutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro fired in the equaliser after City failed to clear in a goalmouth scramble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt O'Riley has had to wait for his Premier League debut after suffering a serious ankle injury days after sealing a move from Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Danish international marked his bow in style when he slotted in from Pedro's pass seven minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not able to do 90 minutes right now. Four defeats in a row. We have to change things quick," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe after seven years winning six Premier Leagues, maybe one year another team deserves it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool kicked off at Anfield just 30 minutes later and quickly capitalised on City's latest slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a superb counter-attack in the 20th minute, Mohamed Salah was sent racing clear by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Salah tumbled to the turf under pressure, Darwin Nunez seized on the loose ball and fired high into the net from an acute angle for his third goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's composed finish in the 84th minute after another rapid Liverpool raid sealed their ninth win in 11 league games and 15th victory in 17 matches in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first English title since 2020, Liverpool, who finished a distant third to City last season, have been revitalised following Arne Slot's arrival from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp as manager in the close-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa have slumped to eighth place after losing their last four games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves ended a wait since April for a Premier League win by beating fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to move off the foot of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary O'Neil was under huge pressure to deliver after a 13-game winless run in the top flight and got the perfect start when Pablo Sarabia swept home Matheus Cunha's pass for Wolves' fastest ever Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cunha smashed home a stunning second goal himself early in the second period to give Wolves a vital three points, which sees Southampton replace them at the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's huge for us. He has such ability," said O'Neil on Cunha's influence. "A big win for us and Matheus Cunha had a big say in it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham moved into seventh by inflicting more misery on Crystal Palace with a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe put Fulham ahead and Palace's Daichi Kamada saw red for a wild lunge on Kenny Tete before Harry Wilson wrapped up the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa scored a brace as Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice the in-form Cherries led through Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bees have taken 16 points from a possible 18 at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford quickly levelled on both occasions through Wissa and Mikkel Damsgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wissa then completed the comeback with his seventh goal in eight league appearances this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham and Everton did little to quell the discontent among both fanbases in a 0-0 draw. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cycling great Mark Cavendish announced his retirement from the sport on Saturday, writing on social media that his final race will be Sunday's Tour de France Singapore Criterium.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Sunday will be the final race of my professional cycling career," wrote the 39-year-old British rider, the record stage winner on the Tour de France with 35, in a post on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling has given me so much and I love the sport. I've always wanted to make a difference in it and now I am ready to see what the next chapter has in store for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am lucky enough to have done what I love for almost 20 years and I can now say that I have achieved everything that I can on the bike," the rider from the Isle of Man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish won the world road race title in 2011 and an omnium silver medal at the 2016 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over two decades he won 165 races, including 17 stages in the Giro d'Italia and three in the Vuelta a Espana. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Famine is looming in the northern Gaza Strip amid increased hostilities and a near-halt in food aid, a UN-backed assessment said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The alert from the Famine Review Committee warned of "an imminent and substantial likelihood of famine occurring, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Famine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  On October 17, the body projected that the number of people in Gaza facing "catastrophic" food insecurity between November and April 2025 would reach 345,000, or 16 percent of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report classified that as IPC Phase 5 – a situation when "starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since that report, conditions have worsened in the north of Gaza, with a collapse of food systems, a drop in humanitarian aid and critical water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, the committee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can therefore be assumed that starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas," it read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been devastated by Israel's retaliatory assault launched after the October 7 attack last year by Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces have intensified their operations in large swathes of the Gaza Strip's north since early October, where evacuation orders are in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aid shipments allowed to enter the Gaza Strip were now lower than at any time since October 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Access to food continues to deteriorate, with prices of essentials on the black market soaring. Cooking gas rose by 2,612 percent, diesel by 1,315 percent and wood by 250 percent, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Concurrent with the extremely high and increasing prices of essential items has been the total collapse of livelihoods to be able to purchase or barter for food and other basic needs," said the alert.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body expressed concern over Israel's cutting ties last month with the UN aid agency for Palestinians (UNRWA), warning of "extremely serious consequences for humanitarian operations" in Gaza. (AFP)

    S Sudan floods affect 1.4 million, displace 379,000

<img alt="Four straight years of flooding linked to climate change has left the world's youngest nation suffering from severe food insecurity and outbreaks of disease. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778331_1_20241109194114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Devastating flooding in South Sudan is affecting around 1.4 million people, with more than 379,000 displaced, according to a United Nations update that warned about an upsurge in malaria.
 <br>
  <br>
  Aid agencies have said that the world's youngest country, highly vulnerable to climate change, is in the grip of its worst flooding in decades, mainly in the north.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said about 1.4 million people were affected by floods in 43 counties and the disputed Abyei region, which is claimed by both South Sudan and Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over 379,000 individuals are displaced in 22 counties and Abyei," it added in a statement issued late on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surge in malaria has been reported in several states, it said, "overwhelming the health system and exacerbating the situation and impact in flood-hit areas."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, the world's youngest nation has remained plagued by chronic instability, violence and economic stagnation as well as climate disasters such as drought and floods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Bank said last month that the latest floods were "worsening an already critical humanitarian situation marked by severe food insecurity, economic decline, continued conflict, disease outbreaks, and the repercussions of the Sudan conflict," which has seen several hundred thousand people pour into South Sudan.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than seven million people are food insecure in South Sudan and 1.65 million children are malnourished, according to the UN's World Food Programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country also faces another period of political paralysis after the president's office announced in September yet another extension to a transitional period agreed in a 2018 peace deal, delaying elections by two years to December 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key provisions of the transitional agreement remain unfulfilled – including the creation of a constitution and the unification of the rival forces of President Salva Kiir and his foe Reik Machar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delay has left South Sudan's partners and the United Nations exasperated, with UN envoy Nicholas Haysom on Thursday describing it as a "regrettable development."
  <br>
  <br>
  All local and international parties involved "must collectively seize the opportunity to make this extension the last, and deliver the peace and democracy that the people of South Sudan deserve," added Haysom.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources but the vital source of revenue was decimated in February when an export pipeline was damaged in neighbouring war-torn Sudan. (AFP)

    Japan's Sasaki set to follow Ohtani with move to MLB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hotly tipped Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki was on Saturday given the green light to follow in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and move to Major League Baseball.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki, widely regarded as one of the best players in Japan's domestic league, will be posted for a potential move to the US, his club the Chiba Lotte Marines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means MLB clubs will have the right to bid for the 23-year-old right-hander this offseason, in an agreement between the Japanese and American leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki threw a perfect game in April 2022 and was part of the Japan team that won last year's World Baseball Classic alongside Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani won his first MLB championship last month when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki said he had "nothing but gratitude" to the Marines for agreeing to post him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You only get one baseball career and I don't want to have any regrets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meet the expectations of everyone who has pushed me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki's father and grandparents were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  His house was swept away when the earthquake unleashed a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing, and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. (AFP)

    Rome's Trevi Fountain opens temporary tourist catwalk

<img alt="For the time being at least, people can view the famous architecture from a completely different perspective. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778343_1_20241109213345.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A suspended walkway providing tourists an up-close view of Rome's Trevi Fountain was unveiled on Saturday, a temporary addition while the famous "La Dolce Vita" site undergoes cleaning.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Baroque masterpiece constructed on the facade of a palace is one of the most popular sites in Rome for tourists, who strain over the crowds to throw their coins into its water.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the fountain is being cleaned to remove limestone deposits and grime, however, the walkway positioned over its basin will accommodate some 130 people at a time to take a closer look.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will give tourists "an experience not ruined by excessive crowding," said Rome's mayor, Roberto Gualtieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to give everybody the opportunity to admire the fountain and to do this from a unique perspective, because what you can see from the walkway, you will never be able to see normally," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  French tourist Franc Petretto, 50, was one of the first to walk across the passageway, calling the view "wonderful and very, very beautiful."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even without the water flowing inside the fountain, you can really see that the architecture is serious... and that's really very pleasing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Micaela di Caterina, a 32-year-old visiting from Argentina, agreed, saying the up-close look at the intricate sculptures of Oceanus, father of the river gods, and his sea-horses was "incredible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, she acknowledged, it was "kind of weird" to be walking over the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fountain – where Anita Ekberg frolicked in Federico Fellini's 1960 film "La Dolce Vita" – last got a thorough scrub a decade ago during an 18-month renovation sponsored by Fendi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, too, the Italian fashion house installed a plexiglass bridge above the basin allowing tourists to still admire the fountain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current work involves removing limestone deposits on the fountain's facade, which can turn black with time, while removing loose material between stones where vegetation grows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourists won't be allowed to toss coins over their shoulders into the fountain's basin – where tradition has it that visitors who do so will return to Rome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, a small pool set up next to the walkway has been installed to receive spare change.
  <br>
  <br>
  That pool "allows us to avoid throwing coins, which, without water, would damage the fountain," Gualtieri said, adding that anyone doing so would be fined.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also allows the flow of donations to Rome's needy to continue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Every week, authorities recuperated some 10,000 euros in coins from Trevi Fountain, which were donated to the Caritas charity to fund meals, said Gaultieri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are proud not to have interrupted such important work for those in difficulty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The walkway will be up until the cleaning is complete, sometime in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaultieri said city officials were still considering a possible ticketing system to control the crowds at Trevi Fountain once the cleaning is over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Visitor numbers are expected to surge next year for the Jubilee, a holy year held by the Catholic Church around once every 25 years, with some 30 million people expected in Rome and the Vatican. (AFP)

    Gaza rescuers say 14 killed in Israeli strikes

<img alt="Israel's military offensive in Gaza has reduced the territory to rubble. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778335_1_20241109201759.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gaza's civil defence agency said on Saturday that Israeli air strikes killed at least 14 Palestinians overnight, including women and children, while the Israeli military said it had eliminated dozens of militants in the territory's north.
 <br>
  <br>
  An air strike hit tents housing displaced Palestinians in the southern area of Khan Younis, killing at least nine people, including children and women, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Palestinian Red Crescent also confirmed the toll, saying 11 others were wounded in the strike and were taken to Nasser Hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second air strike killed five people, including children, and injured about 22 when "Israeli warplanes hit Fahad Al-Sabah school," which had been turned into a shelter for "thousands of displaced people" in the Al-Tuffah district of Gaza City, Bassal said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dead and injured were taken to Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the military has struck several schools-turned-shelters where Israel has said Palestinian militants are operating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Israeli military said its troops killed "dozens of terrorists" in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, where it has been conducting a sweeping air and ground operation for more than a month to prevent Hamas from regrouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli forces also killed several militants in the area of Rafah in the territory's south, the military added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The military is currently engaged in a two-front war, with troops fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past day, the IAF (air force) struck over 50 terror targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip," the military said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among the targets struck were military structures, weapons storage facilities and launchers," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's war in Gaza broke out after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7 last year, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people on Israeli side, most of them civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures, which included those who died and were killed in captivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the attack, militants abducted 251 people, 97 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's retaliatory military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 43,508 people, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers to be reliable. (AFP)

    Pakistani separatists kill 26 in railway station blast

<img alt="The huge blast was aimed at military personnel waiting on the platform at Quetta station. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778329_1_20241109185345.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A bombing claimed by Pakistani separatists killed 26 people including 14 soldiers at a railway station in the southwestern Balochistan province, a hospital spokesman said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blast hit as passengers waited on a platform at the main railway station in the provincial capital Quetta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fourteen members of the army and 12 civilians were killed," said Wasim Baig, spokesman for Quetta's Sandeman Provincial Hospital, raising an earlier toll of 25 provided by police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forty-six members of the security forces and 14 civilians were wounded, the spokesman added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Journalists saw pools of blood and ripped backpacks at the scene, where a large metal sheet protecting passengers from the elements had been blown off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite frequent attacks in Balochistan the toll of Saturday's blast was particularly high for the southwestern province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train station explosion hit at around 8:45 am (0345 GMT) and was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), one of the area's main separatist groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack "was carried out on a Pakistani army unit at Quetta railway station... after completing a course at the Infantry School," the BLA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Associated Press of Pakistan, the official news agency, cited railway officials as saying the blast happened near the ticket booth when two trains were scheduled to depart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the attackers "will pay a heavy price," according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BLA frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Quetta station, police said they were working to determine the cause of the blast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we reached here, initially it appeared that some explosive had perhaps been hidden or left in the luggage. But now we think it may be a suicide bomber," Muhammad Baloch, a senior local police official, told journalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters, rescuers and passengers were working through abandoned luggage on the platform, guarded by heavily armed members of the security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Militants have in the past targeted energy projects with foreign financing, accusing outsiders of exploiting the resource-rich region while excluding residents in the poorest part of Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, the BLA claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants who killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls to hit the region. (AFP)

 It's 365 days until the 15th National Games, and Hong Kong kicked off a countdown ceremony to celebrate, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next year – from November 9 to 21  –  along with Guangdong and Macau.  It will also be the first time the countrywide competition will have multiple host regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight of the 34 competitive events will take place in the HKSAR, including fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball, and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the countdown ceremony at government headquarters, Chief Executive John Lee said that the government is working hard to prepare for the Games and will carry out several trial runs, starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's hopeful that the multi-host cities approach can boost cooperation within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay development plays a key strategic role in the country’s new development framework. By hosting the Games together, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are deepening their collaboration in areas like culture, sports, economy, and society, promoting high-quality development across the Greater Bay Area. It’s particularly meaningful for the three places to work together towards building a top-notch Bay Area in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, Hong Kong will also host four competitive events for the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special Olympic Games in December next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted the government will use various channels to educate people about the events and build excitement, including banners, exhibitions, as well as activities in communities and schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities plan to open up more volunteer positions for the Games, saying so far 30,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's National Games will mark Hong Kong's eighth time participating in the countrywide competition, where the SAR has already won 47 medals, including 11 gold.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, a countdown ceremony was also held at the Haixinsha Asian Games Park in Guangzhou, where Lee and Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng gave video speeches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Guangzhou, Sun Zhiyang, said the city will treat the one-year countdown mark as a fresh starting point and promised to stick to a green, shared, open, and connected approach to organising the Games, while making sure the event is safe, simple and still amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, said the one-year mark shows that preparations for the Games are in the final stages and that everything is going smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will keep our promises and give our best in preparations, including building quality venues and essential facilities, coordinating, running trial runs, and providing excellent services, security, and promotion, as well as improving city infrastructure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the State General Administration of Sports Gao Zhidan for his part said organising work are now at a critical stage and urged Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau to step up their coordination and teamwork.

 President Xi Jinping met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Beijing on Saturday, according to Xinhua news agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly sworn-in Indonesian leader landed in China on Friday, kicking off his first overseas tour seeking a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi held a welcome ceremony for Prabowo at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, where the bilateral talks took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes the visit will take bilateral relations to a "new level".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready to work with Indonesia to take this visit as an opportunity to consolidate high-level political mutual trust," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo is also meeting Premier Li Qiang and number three official Zhao Leji on his trip, which ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will travel onwards to Washington, at the invitation of US President Joe Biden, as part of a world tour which will also include Peru, Brazil and Britain. (AFP)
