<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine on Wednesday called on its Western allies not to fuel tensions inside the country, after a string of embassies in Kyiv announced they would close, citing the threat of a "massive air attack" on the capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The warnings of fresh strikes come as Moscow looks to retaliate against Ukraine for firing US-supplied long-range missiles at Russian territory for the first time and with the Kremlin accusing outgoing US President Joe Biden of dragging out the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia has already ramped up a wave of deadly missile strikes in recent days, targeting residential areas and Ukraine's energy grid. Air alerts blare out across the country daily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States led the wave of closures, saying it was shutting its Kyiv office to the public after having received "specific information of a potential significant air attack" on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not provide further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece, Hungary, Italy and Spain – all Nato members – followed suit, announcing the closures of their diplomatic premises in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian officials criticised the rare move and called on its allies not to spread yet more fear among Ukrainian society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyiv said the "information" the US was referring to looked to be a "psychological operation" launched by Moscow in a bid to destabilise the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remind you that the threat of strikes by the aggressor state has unfortunately been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days," Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nerves are already frayed in Kyiv after almost three years of war, and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has injected fresh uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has repeatedly criticised US support for Ukraine and claimed he could broker a ceasefire within hours – comments that have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian attacks without American support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ukraine and Russia are jockeying for the upper hand on the battlefield before he re-enters the White House in January. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 LPGA golfers will compete for a record US$131 million in prize money over a 33-event season in 2025, the tour's 75th anniversary campaign, LPGA officials announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the season-ending Tour Championship at Naples, Florida, next year's schedule was unveiled, including two new tournaments and two unofficial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total prize money will have jumped US$62 million in four years, next season's payout jumping 90 percent from the pandemic-hit 2021 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 season was another year of historic growth for the LPGA Tour, and with this 2025 schedule we will continue to improve on that growth," LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA's global schedule will begin two weeks later than this year and see competition in the United States and 11 other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The season-opening LPGA Tournament of Champions in Orlando on January 30-February 2 will be followed the next week by the Founders Cup at Bradenton before the tour heads for Asia in February and March for events in Thailand, Singapore and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA Match Play will be contested April 2 to 6 in Las Vegas ahead of the year's first women's major, the Chevron Championship at The Woodlands, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  May will feature two new LPGA events, the Black Desert Championship in Ivins, Utah on May 1 to 4 and the first LPGA event in Mexico since 2017, the Riviera Maya Open in Cancun on May 22 to 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second major, the US Women's Open, will be contested May 29 to June 1 at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, followed by the Women's PGA Championship on June 19 to 22 at PGA Frisco in Frisco, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year's final majors will be the Evian Championship in France on July 10-13 and the Women's British Open on July 31 to August 3 at Royal Porthcawl in Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA returns to North America until a late-season Asia swing with events in October at Shanghai, South Korea and Malaysia and a November stop in Japan before two final events, the Annika on November 13 to 16 and the 2025 season-ending Tour Championship in Naples on November 20 to 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean tournaments will include the biennial International Crown team event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FM Championship in Boston on August 28 to 31 will have a US$4.1 million purse, the first event to crack US$4 million in prize money outside of the majors and Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, nine tournaments will have elevated purses from 2024. (AFP)

<img alt="Italy celebrating after winning the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780161_1_20241121055027.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup for the fifth time as Jasmine Paolini beat Rebecca Sramkova to secure a dominant 2-0 win over Slovakia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number four Paolini triumphed 6-2, 6-1 in the second singles rubber to follow up Lucia Bronzetti's 6-2, 6-4 victory against Viktoria Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy were runners-up to Canada in last year's final but went one better in Malaga to become world champions for the first time since 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory capped a stunning year for Paolini who finished as runner-up at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable year, unbelievable, to finish like this with the Billie Jean King cup, it's amazing, I don't have words to describe it," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trying just to enjoy it, it's important to understand where you are, I feel lucky to be in this position – I feel lucky to be part of this team," she added. "I'm really happy that this year we could bring the trophy home again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, who won the competition in 2002, had never lost a BJK Cup tie in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underdogs defeated USA, Australia and Great Britain on a stunning run to this year's final, but Bronzetti breezed past Hruncakova in under 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Sramkova, ranked 43rd, survived two break points to hold for 2-2 in the first set but the superior Paolini broke for a 4-2 lead, which she consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian double faulted to hand Paolini two set points and the Italian took the first of them when Sramkova slapped a shot into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini broke in the second game of the second set and it looked like she might power to victory without a fight, but Sramkova immediately hit back to get back on serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova defeated Danielle Collins, Ajla Tomljanovic and Katie Boulter on Slovakia's charge to the final but Paolini was a bridge too far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Italian restored her advantage with a fizzing forehand to move 3-1 ahead and then consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having spent most of her career outside the top 50, 2024 has been a huge leap forward for Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  She broke again when Sramkova went long and served it out to seal an emphatic victory in one hour and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel so sad now, disappointed, but all respect to Italy, for what they did," a deflated Sramkova told reporters. "Maybe in a few days we will enjoy that we are second, and take something for the future from those matches." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed at the end of a choppy session on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia earnings and sold off Target after weak results.
 <br>
  <br>
  One day after Walmart impressed investors with a bullish report ahead of the holiday shopping season, Target lost more than one-fifth of its market value as the retailer projected flat comparable sales in the coming quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Target "encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures," acknowledged CEO Brian Cornell, adding that he remained "confident in the underlying strength and fundamentals of our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 43,408.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,917, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 18,966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have been monitoring the brittle state of the Russia-Ukraine conflict after Moscow loosened its rules on using nuclear arms following Ukraine firing long-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  US investors have also been fixated on earnings from artificial intelligence star Nvidia due late on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 0.8 percent during the session and another 2.9 percent after the company reported US$19 billion in profits, easily topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Comcast rose 1.6 percent after announcing plans to pool together cable network channels including CNBC and MSNBC in a spin-off, further denting the conventional cable news business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford fell 2.9 percent as it announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe, mostly in Germany and Britain. Executives also signalled they expect the incoming Trump administration to shift course on energy and climate policy, likely slowing the ramp-up of electric vehicle production. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Wednesday said it strongly condemns and opposes some Western governments, anti-China groups and politicians, as well as foreign media for smearing and maliciously attacking the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR’s statement was in response to foreign criticism of court sentences handed down to 45 people on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman stressed the court made the decision following 118 days of open trial, and after going through an extensive amount of evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added that all of the legal considerations were laid out in an 82-page judgement, which can be downloaded by members of the public.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the case had nothing to do with advocating democracy or freedoms, saying the offenders had engaged in acts that endanger national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government stressed it will continue to do all it takes to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' on HKSAR officials by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate People's Republic of China and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR despises such threats and will not be intimidated by such despicable behaviour. The HKSAR will continue to resolutely continue to discharge the duty of safeguarding national security."

<img alt='US Director Joel Souza - author of the "Rust" movie, talks during an AFP interview at Camerimage film festival in Torun, Poland. Photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780136_1_20241120205151.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Western "Rust" will get its world premiere on Wednesday at a Polish film festival, three years after its cinematographer was killed in a tragic on-set shooting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hollywood star Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules in the 2021 death of Halyna Hutchins, but his involuntary manslaughter trial collapsed earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins's mother refused to attend the premiere "when there is still no justice for my daughter".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and take responsibility for her death," Olga Solovey said Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, will introduce the movie at the Camerimage film festival -- known for celebrating cinematography -- in Torun, northern Poland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the "massive devastation" of the shooting left him an emotional wreck.
  <br>
  <br>
  "'Rust' just became this sort of insane hurricane," he told AFP. "You're just left to sort of pick up the pieces."
  <br>
  <br>
  The filmmaker admitted that he agonised over whether to complete the movie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely on the fence... There was a time when I thought I just didn't want to make movies anymore," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said what convinced him to finish it was learning that Hutchins's husband wanted her final work to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Camerimage said it was also Hutchins's "dream" to have her work shown at the festival, but that "Baldwin will not be there".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Emmy-winning actor was holding a revolver during a rehearsal on set in New Mexico when a live round was fired, fatally wounding 42-year-old Hutchins.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tragic irony, the film centres on an accidental killing -- a parallel that Souza called "unsettling".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a strange one to unpack. When people hear about it, they generally fall silent for a few moments because they can't believe" it, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza and Baldwin developed the script from research Souza was doing on the youngest person ever to be hanged in the Old West.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rust" tells the story of an outlaw who rides to rescue his 13-year-old grandson from execution for an accident being treated as murder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter for accidentally loading Baldwin's prop gun with a live round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baldwin's own trial spectacularly collapsed in July when it emerged that prosecutors had not turned over a batch of bullets that detectives had found during their investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Filming was halted by the fatal incident, but completed last year on location in Montana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hutchins, a former journalist who grew up in Ukraine, had been named as one of the industry's rising stars in 2019 by American Cinematographer magazine.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the tragedy prompted some calls for banning firearms from sets altogether, new Hollywood guidelines now specify that only an armourer can hand a weapon to an actor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Baldwin was handed the gun on set by the film's first assistant director, who later pleaded guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Souza said "the safety bulletin doesn't go quite far enough. I think they should mandate that no real weapons be used."
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Rust" premiere is not the only controversy at the festival, whosejury is presided over this year by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett.
  <br>
  <br>
  French director Coralie Fargeat pulled her movie starring Demi Moore, "The Substance" -- which won best screenplay at Cannes -- "after discovering the highly misogynistic and offensive words" of festival founder Marek Zydowicz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zydowicz was forced to apologise after appearing to suggest that including more women cinematographers might lead to "mediocre film production" in the line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks, for which Zydowicz later apologised, also led Oscar-winning director British director Steve McQueen, a double Oscar winner for "12 Years A Slave", to also stay away in protest at what he called the "deeply offensive words". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Thai woman was sentenced to death on Wednesday for poisoning a friend with cyanide, in the first of her 14 murder trials.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, 36, an online gambling addict, is accused of swindling thousands of dollars from her victims before killing them with the chemical.
  <br>
  <br>
  A court in Bangkok convicted her on Wednesday for fatally poisoning her friend Siriporn Kanwong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two met up near Bangkok in April last year to release fish into the Mae Klong river as part of a Buddhist ritual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Siriporn collapsed and died shortly afterwards and investigators found traces of cyanide in her body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police were then able to link Sararat to previously unsolved cyanide poisonings going back as far as 2015, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The court's decision is just," Siriporn's mother, Tongpin Kiatchanasiri, told reporters following the verdict.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to tell my daughter that I miss her deeply, and justice has been done for her today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said Sararat funded her gambling addiction by borrowing money from her victims -- in one case as much as 300,000 baht (nearly US$9,000) -- before killing them and stealing their jewellery and mobile phones.
  <br>
  <br>
  She lured 15 people -- one of whom survived -- to take poisoned "herb capsules", they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sararat faces 13 more separate murder trials, and has been charged with around 80 offences in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ex-husband -- a police lieutenant-colonel -- was given 16 months in prison and her former lawyer two years for complicity in Siriporn's killing, the lawyer for the victim's family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand has been the scene of several sordid and high-profile criminal cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, six foreigners were found dead in a luxury Bangkok hotel after a cyanide poisoning believed to be connected to debts worth millions of baht. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean super producer behind the chart-topping girl band NewJeans resigned from her label Wednesday, following a protracted legal battle with BTS's agency HYBE that has rocked the country's K-pop industry.
 <br>
  <br>
  Min Hee-jin announced her departure in a statement following what she called a "hellish dispute with HYBE" and vowed legal action against the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The saga began in April, when HYBE launched an audit of subsidiary ADOR -- NewJeans' label -- and attempted to push Min out, accusing her of breach of trust.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move sparked a sprawling legal and PR battle, with Min accusing HYBE of copying her star-making formula for a competing girl band, which has seen the boardroom workings of K-pop hashed out in South Korean courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min slammed HYBE's action against her as a "witch hunt" in a statement Wednesday, saying she would take "necessary legal actions" against the company and individuals over the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she would embark on "new K-pop journey" in future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Min, who joined the industry in the early 2000s, is widely regarded as one of the most successful producers in K-pop, having worked with stars such as Girls' Generation, EXO and SHINee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NewJeans, a K-pop phenomenon that made its debut in 2022 and whose members are all under 20, is among HYBE's most successful K-pop groups along with BTS.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has topped global charts, including the Billboard 200, and broke the Guinness World Record last year for "Fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify".
  <br>
  <br>
  The members of NewJeans have publicly shown full support for Min and demanded that she be reinstated as ADOR's CEO at a livestream in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The girl group also sent a formal legal notice to HYBE last week, demanding six specific actions, including reinstating Min, and warning that failure to meet them could lead to the termination of their exclusive contracts.
  <br>
  <br>
  ADOR said in a statement Wednesday that it was "regrettable that Min unilaterally notified us of her resignation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "ADOR will continue to provide our fullest support to NewJeans to help them grow and thrive even further," it said. (AFP)

    Death-row drug convict to be sent back to Philippines

<img alt="Family members of drug trafficking inmate Mary Jane Veloso hold placards pleading for help. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780123_2_20241120193418.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday that a deal has been reached for Indonesia to send home a Filipino death-row drug convict who was nearly executed by firing squad but got a reprieve due to years of pleadings from Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  Marcos thanked Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and his government for granting a longstanding Philippine request for Mary Jane Veloso to be brought back home to serve her sentence in her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Mary Jane Veloso is coming home,” Marcos said in a statement. “Arrested in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to death, Mary Jane’s case has been a long and difficult journey.”
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear when Veloso would be flown back to the Philippines, but Marcos said he looked forward to welcoming her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights and Immigration, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, confirmed that Subianto has given his approval for Veloso's return to the Philippines. That may happen in December, as long as conditions were met, including her continued detention in her country as part of the Indonesian court's sentence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines should also shoulder the costs of her repatriation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said at a news conference in Manila that Filipino authorities would discuss the legal terms of Veloso's transfer with their Indonesian counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian government has asked the Department of Justice in Manila to formally request Veloso's transfer back to the Philippines, Justice Department spokesperson Mico Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision, Marcos said, “is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia — united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso's transfer would remove the possibility of her facing an execution because the Philippines, Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation, has long abolished the death penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2015, Indonesian authorities moved Veloso to an island prison where she and eight other drug convicts were scheduled to be executed by firing squad despite objections from the convicts' home countries, including Australia, Brazil, France, Ghana and Nigeria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia executed the eight other convicts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso’s case has caused a public outcry in the Philippines, where her family and supporters contend she is innocent and was unaware that 2.6 kilograms of heroin was concealed in her suitcase. The drugs were discovered when she entered Indonesia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veloso travelled to Indonesia in 2010 where her godsister reportedly told her a job as a domestic worker awaited her. Her godsister also allegedly provided the suitcase where the prohibited drugs were found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philippine authorities had filed criminal complaints, including for human trafficking, against illegal Filipino recruiters who arranged for Veloso to work in Indonesia, Clavano said. She added that she would serve as a crucial witness in the trial of the suspects when she returns.
  <br>
  <br>
  That Philippine case helped convince Indonesian authorities to delay Veloso's execution and eventually consider her transfer back to her country, Clavano said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos said Veloso’s story resonated with many in the Philippines, as “a mother trapped by the grip of poverty, who made one desperate choice that altered the course of her life."
  <br>
  <br>
  “While she was held accountable under Indonesian law, she remains a victim of her circumstances," Marcos said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines has been a global source of manual labour, including many impoverished women who abandon their families for higher-paying jobs and better opportunities abroad. Alarming abuse, especially of Filipina house helpers, has prompted Philippine authorities to impose restrictions and safeguards but many continue to be exploited.
  <br>
  <br>
  At least 59 Filipinos around the world face the death penalty mostly for drug and murder convictions, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former media tycoon Jimmy Lai on Wednesday began testifying in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he had made donations to local and overseas groups, including think-tanks and religious organisations in the United States amounting to up to US$50,000 a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple Daily founder added that he donated £20,000 to the UK-based group Hong Kong Watch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also said he asked former top US officials to “voice out” for Hong Kong five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told the High Court that he met then vice-president Mike Pence and then secretary of state Mike Pompeo during his trip to Washington in July 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai said he asked Pence to voice support for Hong Kong, adding that it would be “beyond” him to ask Pence to take any concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lai also acknowledged that he had directed Apple Daily to use news of a meeting between former chief secretary Anson Chan and Pence in 2019 to its “maximum effect”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former media tycoon has pleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The questioning is estimated to take 15 days, according to the defence.

    Sports bodies that don't improve face subsidy cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong must remain agile and innovative amid evolving global dynamics, adding that countries and businesses are still adapting and transforming to thrive in a changing environment.
 <br>
  <br>
  Giving a speech at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit, Chan said there is no reason for pessimism, despite the market bracing for potential headwinds from a changing geopolitical landscape and a new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China, for example, has been undergoing remarkable economic transformation, marked by a shift towards high-quality economic growth, supported by domestic consumption, technological innovation, green investment, advanced manufacturing and many more. Chinese enterprises are also expanding their global industry and supply chain footprint in response to shifting geopolitics,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For Hong Kong, our strategy is to continue to engage with traditional markets like the US and Europe, focusing on co-operation in areas of common interests and mutual benefits.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there is still potential and ample room for cooperation across various sectors, including urban planning, infrastructure, ESG (environmental, social and governance) standards and efforts to combat climate change, despite the influence of geopolitics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Belt and Road countries, along with the Global South as a whole, offer vast and untapped business opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Global South now contributes to about 60 percent of global GDP in terms of purchasing power parity, and accounts for over 40 percent of global imports and exports. If we just look at Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), it is collectively on track to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What characterise these markets are rapid economic growth, young populations and an expanding middle class. And above all, they all share a strong aspiration for progress by pursuing investments in infrastructure, green transformation and technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Amid challenging global landscape, they are also seeking to diversify their investments and asset allocation. We are making significant strides to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the growth of these emerging markets.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong continues to be an attractive partner for investors and businesses globally, given the city’s international outlook and commitment to innovation.

 The government on Wednesday unveiled the development outline for the Hong Kong section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone, with the gross floor area in phase one doubling from what was initially planned.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone stretches across the Shenzhen River, covering 302 hectares in Shenzhen and 87 hectares in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR section will be developed in two five-year phases, with phase one covering 1 million square metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After reviewing the future development, in particular the high demand from the market for the Hetao Hong Kong Park, we decided to greatly increase the floor area. And after the hard work and also discussions with the other bureaus and departments, eventually we are able to offer about 1 million square metres for the phase one development," Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech zone will feature three main areas, focusing on life and health technology, artificial intelligence and data science, and advanced manufacturing and new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than two-thirds of the space in phase one is planned for laboratories and research areas, while there will be land set aside for accommodation, visitor lodges and commercial spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, a contact-less clearance process will be implemented to link the parks in Shenzhen and Hong Kong to facilitate personnel flow, and to allow people crossing the border to travel to other parts of the SAR as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Carrie Chang said the government will discuss details with mainland authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this point in time, our thinking is that those people would have to be pre-registered. In terms of who they are, they should be the employees of the tenants of the two parks (because) they do have the need to commute between the two parks frequently," Chang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the list should be accepted by both authorities because after all, it's cross-boundary travel. When we have further details, after further discussions with the mainland authorities, we will inform the members of the public suitably."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government added that there are plans to build footbridges over the Shenzhen River to link the Shenzhen and Hong Kong parks as well, but details are still being discussed.

    'Let students play a part in fighting climate change'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UNICEF Hong Kong on Wednesday said everyone should play a part in living sustainably through environmental protection.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came as it surveyed 256 secondary school students from June to August this year to find out their awareness of environmental policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  It found that almost 80 percent of students value environmental protection, but almost half were unaware of relevant plans by their schools and in the community.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Most of the students would like to learn more about global crises, what is affecting their life, and they want to be more participating, not only to just become a beneficial party, but also involved in voicing out their needs, questions and concerns, and influencing policy making to build a better future,” the organisation’s chair, Judy Chen, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of the students surveyed had a clear understanding of how to save water and electricity at home, such as turning off unnecessary lights and maintaining air conditioner temperatures at 24 degrees or above.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the school setting, their participation in green activities dropped to 50 percent, and mainly involved helping out with waste recycling and using water dispensers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The participation rate further dropped to around 20 percent in the community, as students were unaware of activities taking place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chen said schools should expand their policies and arrangements for saving the planet to align with the government’s sustainability goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of schools are already very well-established, so their environmental planning may not be that up to date. It would be a good opportunity for schools to work with students, to allow them to feel they are fighting climate change as well,” Chen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But this issue is not just limited to schools and students. All stakeholders in the community should also pay attention and be more aware of how to build a more environmentally friendly place for our children,” she added.

    HK$2 transport subsidy age eligibility to remain

<img alt="Chris Sun said while officials are reviewing the HK$2 elderly transport scheme, those aged 60 and above will continue to be beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780093_1_20241120161320.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said the government has no plans to raise the age when older people can enjoy trips on public transport for just HK$2.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the Hong Kong Economic Journal cited sources as saying the minimum age could be raised from the current 60, to 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in a written reply to a question from lawmaker Peter Koon, Sun said there are no plans to do this.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government has stated clearly that it will maintain the policy intent of the HK$2 scheme to build a caring and inclusive society by encouraging the beneficiaries to participate more in community activities, and has no intention to cancel the scheme or change the existing beneficiary groups," Sun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said a review of the scheme is ongoing and the result of this will be announced in due course.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government would take into account the effectiveness of different options in containing the growth of [the scheme's] expenditure and factors including the practicability of these options in the review," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun said the scheme is estimated to have cost nearly HK$4 billion in the last financial year, or 0.7 percent of the government's total operating expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2022-23 financial year, the scheme cost a little more than HK$3 billion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Wednesday said three people charged over a drugs case earlier this year are now also suspected of laundering money to the tune of HK$53 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  A fourth suspect was arrested in Sai Wan Ho on Tuesday over the alleged money laundering. The man, 41, was later released on bail.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two women and a man, aged 23 to 25, continue to be remanded in custody in connection with the HK$28 million dangerous drugs case, officers said, adding that their investigation into the suspected money laundering is still ongoing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Coordinators of a test event for the 15th National Games’ Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau road cycling race say the trial run on Sunday is to test traffic management and the spectator experience.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong portion of the race will take around 90 minutes, with cyclists entering the SAR via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and then going along the North Lantau Highway and Penny’s Bay Highway, before heading back to Zhuhai after passing Hong Kong Disneyland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, said RTHK is liaising with the organising committee in Zhuhai to set up live broadcasting online for viewers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those members of the public who want to watch the competition on site, they can go to the spectator zone in Disneyland, and we expect the area can accommodate up to several hundred spectators," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said organisers place a lot of importance on ensuring a smooth and safe competition and will also use the trial to identify areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Experts from the mainland cycling association and the Hong Kong cycling association, we have conducted several site visits to go through the whole route. They found the whole current route is safe for high-level competitions for experienced cyclists," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the Hong Kong section of the route, our high-risk department have conducted very thorough examination of the whole route and they used different technologies to inspect the route and to make sure it will be safe for the cyclists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Principal Transport Officer Ken Wong said the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will be closed for certain periods on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lanes heading to Macau and Zhuhai will be shut from 7.30am to 12.30pm and lanes in the other direction will be closed between 9am and 12.30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect, according to the prior publicity regarding the event, not too many passengers will make use of the bus to go to Zhuhai and Macau on the coming Sunday," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have already asked MTRCL to pay extra attention to the passenger demand during that morning. If there's any passenger demand, MTRCL will increase the services on the Tung Chung Line, Airport Express Line and Disneyland Line."
  <br>
  <br>
  The test event will be a men's individual 230-kilometres race, which is the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, and will be the only National Games event next year held in all three places.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing minister Winnie Ho said on Wednesday that officials have taken back some 6,400 public flats in the past two and a half years after tenants were found to be abusing housing resources.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written reply to a question from Heung Yee Kuk lawmaker Kenneth Lau, Ho said nearly 400 tenants were prosecuted during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven of them were given jail terms or suspended sentences for violating housing laws. In the most serious case, a tenant was given an immediate jail term of 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is to launch a reward scheme in January, giving people around HK$3,000 for reports of tenancy abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The housing chief said the scheme is generally supported by the community and won't damage relationships between neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding views that the Award Scheme may be a detriment to neighbourhood relationships, the Housing Authority believes that [public housing] residents would not welcome abusers in their neighbourhood," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Tenancy] abuse would bring injustice, or even affect the living environment of public rental housing and bring nuisance."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that it is believed the scheme will enhance awareness of the need to cherish housing resources.

<img alt="Former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, Linda McMahon, will be tasked with leading the US Department of Education under the new Trump administration. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780049_1_20241120123007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump nominated Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, on Tuesday to lead the Department of Education, which he has pledged to abolish.
 <br>
  <br>
  He described McMahon as a "fierce advocate for Parents' Rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon is a co-chair of Trump's transition team ahead of his return to the White House in January. It is tasked with filling some 4,000 positions in the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding McMahon's experience in education, Trump cited her two-year stint on the Connecticut Board of Education and 16 years on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University, a private Catholic school.
  <br>
  <br>
  McMahon left WWE in 2009 to run for a seat in the US Senate, and has been a major donor to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2021, she has chaired the Centre For The American Worker at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the election campaign Trump promised to do away with the federal education department when he returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time. I'm dying to get back to do this. We will ultimately eliminate the federal Department of Education," he said in September during a rally in Wisconsin.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Republican convention in Milwaukee, McMahon said she was "privileged to call Donald Trump a colleague and a boss," as well as "a friend."
  <br>
  <br>
  Her ties with Trump go back to her years in the professional wrestling industry -- she said she first met him as chief executive at WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2017, she was confirmed as the head of the Small Business Administration, which is responsible for supporting America's millions of small businesses, which employ around half the country's private-sector workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  In nominating her, Trump pointed to her experience in business, helping to grow the WWE.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the administration, she served as chair of the pro-Trump America First Action SuperPAC, or political action committee. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 33 points as the Boston Celtics ended the Cleveland Cavaliers' 15-game unbeaten start to the season with a hard-fought 120-117 victory in the NBA Cup on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics unleashed a barrage of 22 three-pointers to overwhelm Cleveland, who clawed their way back to within two points of the lead late in the game after trailing by 21 early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite the Cleveland fightback, reigning NBA champions Boston held their nerve and kept the scoreboard ticking over to close out a deserved win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 33 points included six three-pointers while the Boston star added 12 rebounds and seven assists in an all-round Celtics effort that saw six players finish in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum said Boston's championship pedigree had helped the Celtics over the line as Cleveland threatened late in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of basketball, we've played in the biggest games," Tatum said. "NBA is a bunch of talented teams – guys are gonna make plays, they're gonna make shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time – how you respond shows your growth and how special your team is," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum admitted that ending Cleveland's unbeaten record, which has left them sitting on top of the Eastern Conference, had motivated the Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They came in 15-0 feeling like they were the best team; we felt like we were the best team – it's all competition. We were ready to play today," Tatum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston were quickly into their stride, rattling in five early three-pointers to sprint into an 18-8 in the opening minutes of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland rallied to reduce the deficit to 26-20 at the end of the first quarter, but the Celtics kept up the pressure in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum drained a superb three-pointer in the final seconds of the first half to give Boston a commanding 65-48 lead at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics stretched into a 21-point lead early in the second half, but the Cavaliers clicked into gear and came roaring back to close the gap to two points at 88-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum though had the last word, nailing an imperious three-pointer to give Boston a five-point lead heading into the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nip-and-tuck final period saw Cleveland repeatedly close to two points but Boston pulled clear in the final minutes to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland's scoring with 35 points while Evan Mobley added 22 with 11 rebounds and six assists. (AFP)

 The police on Wednesday were investigating a suspected criminal damage case outside Central Government Offices.
 <br>
  <br>
  At around 8.30am, a security patrol found red paint covering an area of three metres by two metres around a planter pot near Harcourt Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government strongly condemned the incident, saying the police will thoroughly investigate and hold any offender to account.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman said police officers have stepped up patrols in the area and the authorities have instructed security staff of the Central Government Offices to remain vigilant.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

    Tsuen Wan hosts city's best and worst toilets

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Toilet Association says the government should increase its ratio of women's toilets to men's and include urinals in its calculation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Hung, the association's chairman, told RTHK that at the moment, there were two female public lavatories for every male one, but women could often be seen lining up outside the public facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the government should increase the ratio to 1:2.5 and include men's urinals in the calculation of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung was speaking in an interview with RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   Hong Kong Today
  </a>
  programme on Wednesday, to announce the results of its annual survey of the city's best and worst public washrooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoi Hing Road public toilet in Tsuen Wan won top recognition, judged according to the association's CASH formula, which measures Comfort, Accessibility, Safety and Hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very clean, and also very easy to go in to the toilet, and it's safe - that means the floor is not wet - and very hygienic. Most of the taps, or all of the taps, are using sensor control - no need to touch the toilet or the tap," said Hung.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Hung said the worst toilet was in Tsuen Wan Market, describing the washroom as dirty, smelly, with rusty facilities and a wet floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We asked the government to take action as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hung said over the past 10 years, after the government had injected about HK$6 million into refurbishing some 200 toilets, the image of the public facilities had greatly improved.

    AI plays big role in peacekeeping: Unesco

<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    OSC funding improves access to mental health therapy

<img alt="Dr Candice Powell expressed hope that with the help of OSC funding, students at risk of mental health problems could receive their services as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pioneering initiative, one of the beneficiaries of this year's Operation Santa Claus (OSC), is hoping to improve access to mental health therapies, with practitioners providing free, short-term, and remote support to local citizens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Improving Access to Community Therapies (iACT) was designed and developed by Mind HK - a mental health charity set up in 2017 by Dr Lucy Lord to ensure no one faces a mental health problem alone in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, a report by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that 1 in 4 students suffered from mental health problems, pointing to the importance of early intervention to prevent student mental health further deteriorating.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Candice Powell, CEO of Mind HK, says their goal is to receive funding in order to serve at least 300 students to receive one-on-one psychological support based on the iACT model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that therapies shouldn't just be in the hospital but actually can happen in the community, so that's why we are launching this programme in secondary schools," said Dr Powell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Project coordinator Coco says she herself also benefited from the iACT short-term emotional support service after graduating from university and feeling anxious about her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The well-being practitioner used iACT as the therapy to how we live with our negative emotion and help me to find my life value. We can use another way to live with some negative emotion. We don't always need to fight them or eliminate those negative emotion," Coco said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of its pilot phase from 2021 to 2024, Mind HK trained over 100 well-being practitioners to work with youth and adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

    HK rejects latest US congressional report

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said on Wednesday it strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects a US congressional report that criticised the SAR and central governments and the city's national security law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It said the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) had used politics to prevail over law-based administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and firmly rejects USCC's wanton manoeuvre with politics prevailing over law-based administration and interference in the affairs of the HKSAR in the so-called report,” the government statement wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US report said changes in the SAR raised questions about Hong Kong’s ability to maintain its position as the financial connector between mainland China and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, the SAR government said the accusations are groundless attacks, slanders and smears against various aspects of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges again individual United States politicians to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs," the government said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said since the implementation of a national security law in 2020, the US had continued to turn a blind eye to the large-scale and incessant rioting which occurred in 2019 that devastated Hong Kong's society, livelihoods and the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the law enabled livelihoods and economic activities to return to normal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said Hong Kong's rise in world competitiveness rankings to be among the world's top economies was testament to the fact that high-level security protection underpins high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US enjoyed economic benefits in Hong Kong, with a trade surplus of some US$270 billion with the SAR over the past 10 years, and there were more than 1,200 US companies operating businesses in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said all these demonstrated the close and long-standing economic ties between the two places, so a stable and prosperous Hong Kong was of mutual benefit to the US.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia swept past Britain in the Billie Jean King Cup semi-final doubles decider on Tuesday to seal a 2-1 victory and set up a title showdown with Italy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Tereza Mihalikova saw off British duo Olivia Nicholls and Heather Watson 6-2, 6-2 in the decisive rubber. Slovakia, the 2002 winners, face last year's runners-up Italy in Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cried like a baby but now I'm very calm and ready for tomorrow," said an emotional Mihalikova. "We need one more win, then we can touch the trophy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia are into their second final having lifted the trophy the last time against Spain in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Jasmine Paolini's Italy reached a second consecutive BJK Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland. Four-time winners Italy last lifted the women's team trophy in 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu, who won the US Open in 2021, won the opening singles tie 6-4, 6-4 against Hruncakova to keep four-time runners-up Britain's hopes of a first final in 43 years alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rebecca Sramkova's comeback from a set down to beat British number one Katie Boulter 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 forced a decisive doubles rubber which Slovakia dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are just enjoying every match, we have got nothing to lose, we're just trying to do our best," said Stramkova. "I don't think the (doubles) girls have the pressure, I don't have the pressure either, because we're underdogs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu opened the first set with a break against Hruncakova, ranked 238th in the world, 180 places beneath her.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton led 5-2 with another break in the fifth game before Hruncakova found her footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian saved a set point, breaking back for 5-3 and then consolidating as Raducanu wobbled but then closed out comfortably on her serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sidelined with a foot injury since mid-September until this week, the 22-year-old at times struggled with her opponent's power but was otherwise superior. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Superstar Rafael Nadal's glittering career in professional tennis came to an end on Tuesday as the Netherlands eliminated Spain in the Davis Cup quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard, a 22-time Grand Slam winner, was defeated in the first singles rubber and after Carlos Alcaraz won the second match to send the tie to a doubles decider, the Dutch triumphed to snatch a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Botic van de Zandschulp in the opening singles clash, before Alcaraz defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (7/0), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the deciding doubles rubber, Van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof secured a 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/3) victory to set up a semi-final clash with Canada or Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  After years ravaged by injuries and not having played an official singles match since July, doubts hung over Nadal's involvement in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were resolved when captain David Ferrer confirmed he would play in the first singles rubber of the opening finals clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal appeared emotional during the Spanish national anthem, and over 10,000 fans filled the arena with chants of "Rafa, Rafa," when it ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was having an emotional day, nerves before what could be my last singles match as a professional," said Nadal. "The emotions hearing the national anthem for the last time as a professional were very special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal had won his last 29 Davis Cup singles matches out of 30 played after debuting in the tournament in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite giving every ounce of his energy in the second set and buoyed by immense home support, Nadal fell short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the beginning I think we were both nervous – the crowd was tough, understandably," said Van de Zandschulp. "That is what it is to play against Rafa in Spain – he is probably the biggest sportsman here in Spain that ever lived."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given his diminished physical condition Nadal, ranked 154th in the world, attempted to keep points short, with big serves and occasional flashes of his lethal forehand, followed by a classic fist pump and roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 80 Van de Zandschulp sought to put Nadal on his backhand and the indoor hard-court tournament was far from an ideal surface for the record 14-time Roland Garros winning 'King of Clay'.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman opened up two break points at 4-4 and took the second with a fine cross-court winner to claim the lead, and then converted his second set point to dampen Spanish spirits. (AFP)

    SpaceX fails to repeat Starship booster catch

<img alt="Donald Trump attended the launch as a guest of Elon Musk. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779999_1_20241120073943.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 SpaceX's Starship mega-rocket blasted off on its latest test flight on Tuesday, with US President-elect Donald Trump joining Elon Musk to witness the spectacle firsthand in the latest sign of their ever-closer ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican leader was deprived of the chance to see the booster stage caught in the launch tower's "chopstick" arms, an engineering marvel demonstrated by the company last month and one he personally lauded during his election victory speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, the colossal Super Heavy first stage made a more subdued splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Company representatives cited unmet technical criteria, dampening the triumph of an event attended by a bevvy of Trump-world figures, including Donald Trump Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Trump greeted Musk warmly on Tuesday afternoon, sporting a red Maga hat as the pair headed off to watch from the control tower of the company's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, where the rocket blasted off at 4pm local time (2200 GMT) on the sixth test flight for Starship.
  <br>
  <br>
  SpaceX founder and CEO Musk has been a constant presence at Trump's side since the incoming president's election victory, joining him at a meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei and even at a UFC bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to travel to Musk's home turf was the latest sign of the growing alliance between the billionaire duo, which has raised questions over possible conflicts of interests given SpaceX's lucrative contracts with Nasa and the Pentagon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's launch marked the quickest turnaround between test flights for the world's most powerful rocket, a gleaming, 121-metre-tall stainless steel colossus central to Musk's ambition of colonising Mars and making humanity a multiplanetary species.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk aims to launch the first uncrewed missions to the Red Planet as early as 2026, coinciding with the next "Mars transfer window" – a period when the journey between Earth and Mars is at its shortest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasa is also counting on a specialised version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade under its Artemis program.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flight six of Starship was seen as a test of whether SpaceX's first booster catch was pure precision or relied on a stroke of luck after Musk – perhaps inadvertently – disclosed how close the last flight came to disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a clip posted to X showcasing his gaming chops in "Diablo IV," sharp-eared fans caught an employee briefing him that the Super Heavy booster was "one second away" from a system failure that could have spelt catastrophe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starship's upper stage will make a partial orbit of Earth, re-enter the atmosphere and splash down in the Indian Ocean a little over an hour later, but this time in the daylight, providing clearer visuals for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key milestones include reigniting Starship's Raptor engines for the first time in space and trialling new heat shield materials. The flight also carries Starship's first ever payload – a stuffed banana – and serves as a swan song for the current generation of Starship prototypes.
  <br>
  <br>
  With twice the thrust of the Saturn V rockets that powered Apollo missions, Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built. Musk has already teased that its successor, Starship V3, will be "3X more powerful" and could take flight within a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flight comes as Musk is riding high on Trump's November 5 White House win, having campaigned extensively for the returning Republican leader, as well as donating staggering sums from his own fortune to the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  His loyalty has paid off. Musk has been tapped to co-lead a new "Department of Government Efficiency" – or Doge, a cheeky nod to the meme-based cryptocurrency Musk loves to promote.
  <br>
  <br>
  That in turn has led to concerns Musk could engage in "self-dealing" as the CEO is poised to straddle the line between government insider and corporate titan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics worry he could sway regulatory decisions to benefit his six companies, including SpaceX and its marquee Starship programme, which has faced launch delays linked to an environmental review the company called "superfluous." (AFP)

    Guardiola set to extend stay as Man City boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola is set to extend his stay in charge of Manchester City by signing a one-year extension to his contract, the Athletic reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won six Premier League titles and the club's first ever Champions League since arriving at the Etihad in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach's current contract expires at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been speculation that Guardiola's time could be coming to an end with City facing an uncertain future due to an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's director of football Txiki Begiristain, a close ally of Guardiola, has confirmed his departure at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported that the 53-year-old will pen a one-year extension to his deal with the option for another year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola also signed his two previous contract extensions at City during the November international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions return to action on Saturday, looking to snap an unprecedented losing streak for their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has lost four consecutive games for the first time in his coaching career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hit by the loss of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri to a season-ending knee injury, City have fallen five points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after defeats to Bournemouth and Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also lost 4-1 to Sporting Lisbon in their last Champions League outing and were eliminated from the League Cup by Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won 15 major honours in total during his eight full seasons in Manchester, which also includes two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Club World Cup and one Uefa Super Cup. (AFP)

    Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 end higher after early weakness

<img alt="Wall Street finished mixed ahead of Nvidia results on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779983_1_20241120052411.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks shrugged off early weakness amid the worsening Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday and finished mostly higher ahead of Nvidia results.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent much of the early going on the back foot, as Russia threatened major retaliation after Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, a nuclear threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin unsettled investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices later pushed into positive territory, with the Nasdaq finishing at 18,987, up 1.0 percent
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 5,916, while the Dow Jones declined 0.3 percent to 43,268.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of on our own continent over here," Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners said of the US investor mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In time, we would be impacted by an escalation of tensions. But today we're going to shrug that off, because tomorrow we get Nvidia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence star Nvidia piled on nearly five percent ahead of results on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other tech giants also advanced, Netflix and Tesla winning at least 1.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart rose three percent as it lifted its full-year forecast on higher profits. Walmart's US business, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenues, enjoyed a solid 5.3 percent gain in comparable store sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lowe's dropped 4.6 percent as it lifted some of its full-year projections. However, the home-improvement retailer still expects full-year comparable sales to be down at least three percent in 2024. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China on Tuesday beat Mauritius 1-0 in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium to record their third consecutive victory for the first time in eight years.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a promising look for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood, as the win guarantees a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw – following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's goal in the 11th minute proved to be the winner, who cut in from the right wing to unleash a powerful left-foot drive just beyond the reach of Mauritius goalkeeper Kevin Jean-Louis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius had a player sent off in the 42nd minute for two yellow cards, but managed to hold on the rest of the way without conceding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory means Westwood is the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three straight games, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong are qualifying matches for the East Asian Football Federation, where they will take on Mongolia on December 8 and Chinese Taipei on December 14.

    Macau's made good progress over the years: Ho Iat-seng

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau’s outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, on Tuesday said he’s basically accomplished all of the promises set out in his election manifesto five years ago, adding that the gaming hub has made great strides in many areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters for the first time since his announcement not to seek re-election, Ho said his administration had to overcome many challenges during his five-year tenure – including the Covid pandemic that lasted three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, he said Macau's economy expanded and measures were also put in place to better safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the stress and a prolonged lack of rest over the years had taken a toll on his health, and he believes it's now time to pass the baton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also confirmed that the Macau government will continue to dish out MOP 10,000 to permanent residents and MOP 6,000 to non-permanent residents next year, saying his successor, Sam Hou-fai, agrees with the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the outgoing Macau CE noted that he hopes Macau and Hong Kong can continue to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Macau has always been learning from Hong Kong, saying the city has made substantial progress in areas like finance, maritime and aviation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Hong Kong's development as a mega events hub, Ho said people should not see the two SARs as rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Hong Kong and Macau has the vibe for mega events. We are developing this together... We invite different international singers to perform, and both places have the vibe to host concerts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next term of the Macau government should also work closely with Hong Kong because the relationship between the two places is very good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho's successor, former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai, is due to take office on December 20.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A ruthless Japan moved to the brink of qualifying for their eighth straight World Cup after beating China 3-1 away from home on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Headers from Koki Ogawa and Ko Itakura put runaway group leaders Japan two goals up at half time before Lin Liangming pulled one back for China early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa snuffed out China's hopes of a comeback with his second of the game six minutes later in front of a vociferous crowd of 45,000 in Xiamen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were playing their first senior international in China in nine years and there is a long history of rivalry between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a heavy police presence outside the Xiamen Egret Stadium where hundreds of Japan fans were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loud booing greeted the Japanese national anthem before kick-off and the game was briefly stopped in the first half when a fan invaded the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win gave Japan five wins and a draw in Asian qualifying Group C and took them to within touching distance of a place at the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two teams in each of the three groups will reach the showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan are at home to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in their next fixtures in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China gave a much-improved performance after losing 7-0 to Japan in Saitama in their opening group game.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have six points from six games and are still in the hunt for a place at their first World Cup since 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan made several changes to the team that beat Indonesia 4-0 in Jakarta on Friday with Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma and Crystal Palace's Daichi Kamada among those dropping to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa opened the scoring in the 39th minute, planting a firm header past goalkeeper Wang Dalei direct from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan doubled their lead just before the half-time whistle and again it came from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Koki Machida flicked on Junya Ito's delivery and Itakura was unmarked at the back post to nod the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  China found the perfect reply to start the second half when Lin pulled a goal back for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie Wenneng cleverly dummied Wei Shihao's pass and Lin slotted the ball past goalkeeper Zion Suzuki.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's joy lasted just six minutes before Ogawa headed in another Ito cross to restore Japan's two-goal cushion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled all typhoon signals at 10.10pm on Tuesday as Man-yi continues to weaken and moves away from Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The T1 signal was issued on Monday morning and had been in force for well over 30 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecaster also noted that water level is expected to rise on Tuesday night and warned that minor flooding may occur in low-lying coastal areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the combined effect of spring tide, the northeast monsoon and Man-yi, the water level of the coast of Hong Kong will rise higher than normal tonight," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From around 10pm tonight to midnight, a high water level of near 3 metres above Chart Datum is expected in Victoria Harbour, and a high water level of about 3.1 metres above Chart Datum is expected at Tai O."
  <br>
  <br>
  People are advised to stay away from the shoreline and remain on the alert.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that anyone who intends to endanger national security will be punished in accordance with the law, after 45 opposition figures were sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Lee said the court decision reflects the severity of the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sentence shows the court confirmed that the offence of the defendants was extremely serious and they should be severely punished,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE stressed Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law, and offenders must be held accountable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Those involved acted under the guise of democracy and freedom to subvert the political regime of the HKSAR… This case shows that anyone who intends to subvert state power and endanger national security will ultimately be punished in accordance with the law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesman, meanwhile, called on foreign governments to stop interfering in SAR affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The HKSAR government has noticed that the United States and some Western countries, anti-China organisations, anti-China politicians and foreign media have recently made malicious attacks and smears on various cases,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The HKSAR government has stated on many occasions that like all cases, this case was handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law.”

 Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine claimed it hit a military weapons depot in Bryansk in the middle of the night, though it didn't specify what weapons it used. The Ukrainian General Staff said that multiple explosions and detonation were heard in the targeted area.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement carried by Russian news agencies, the Russian defence ministry said the military shot down five Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, and damaged one more.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fragments fell on the territory of an unspecified military facility, the ministry said. The falling debris sparked a fire, but didn’t inflict any damage or casualties, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither side's claims could be independently verified. (AP)

    British farmers protest against inheritance tax

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British farmers massed in London on Tuesday, calling on the Labour government to scrap plans to change inheritance tax rules for land ownership, which they say threatens the agriculture sector and food production.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tractors with banners calling the move "the final straw" for the beleaguered sector drove around Parliament Square, while farmers lobbied lawmakers and others called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration to think again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've brought thousands of farmers to London to explain to the government that farmers are food producers, and this ludicrous budget is going to put us all out of business," farmer Olly Harrison told AFP from the protests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Farmers just simply will pack up... it's just too much for us -- we've just had enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Although on a smaller scale, the demonstrations are reminiscent of protests when an earlier Labour government incensed rural communities in the early 2000s with a plan to ban foxhunting with dogs in England and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2002, countryside campaigners estimated that 400,000 people marched through London to oppose the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  National Farmers Union president Tom Bradshaw, said the latest protests would continue for as long as it takes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They (the government) cannot have a policy in place which has such disastrous human impacts and think we're going to go quiet," he told Sky News television.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bradshaw met Environment Secretary Steve Reed on Monday and said afterwards he had shown a "level of understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  But both sides appear to be digging in, as the new Labour government tries to claw back what it says is a £22-billion (US$28-billion) blackhole in public finances left by the last Conservative administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In France and other European countries farmers have also been protesting over increased pressure on their revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Central to the row in Britain, where farmers have been struggling due to lack of funding and post-Brexit labour shortages, is how farms could be taxed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farming businesses previously qualified for 100-percent relief on inheritance tax on agricultural and business property, reducing the amounts that farmers and landowners pay when farmland is passed on after a death.
  <br>
  <br>
  From April 6, 2026, however, total exemption from death duties will only apply to the first £1 million (US$1.27 million) of combined agricultural and business property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any estate valued above that will have to pay a 20-percent tax rate -- half the standard applied to other land and property -- over 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government maintains the actual threshold before paying inheritance tax could be as much as £3 million (US$3.8 million), once exemptions for each partner in a couple and for the farm property are taken into account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starmer said Monday "the vast majority of farms" will not be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the NFU insists that more farms may have to pay the tax when land, property and equipment are taken into account. It points to environment ministry figures that show that 66 percent of farm businesses in England have a net value of more than £1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our numbers suggest that 75 percent of commercial farms, those farms producing this country's food, are caught in the eye of this storm," said Bradshaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farmers fear the financial burden will force farms to be broken up and sold as result of the policy, hitting food production and supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 1,800 farmers lobbied MPs in London on Tuesday, winning support from the opposition Conservative party. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour "clearly doesn't understand or care about rural communities".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tim Farron, environment spokesman for the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats, said direct agricultural subsidies had fallen by 20 percent in real terms since 2015, and 8,100 farms were lost across the country in 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major EU countries are ready to provide defence and financial aid to Ukraine if the United States reduces support, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was speaking on the 1,000th day of the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, as foreign ministers from six major European countries held talks in Warsaw dominated by the war and Donald Trump's return to power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top diplomats from France, Germany, Italy and Poland joined the meeting, while Britain's David Lammy and Spain's Jose Manuel Albares took part by video.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I note with appreciation the readiness of the largest European Union countries to assume the burden of military and financial support for Ukraine in the context of a possible reduction in US involvement," Sikorski told reporters after the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warsaw gathering followed a meeting of all EU foreign ministers in Brussels and comes as Trump's return to the White House threatens a drastic change in US policy nearly three years into the Russian attack on Ukraine. (AFP)

    Rape victim Gisele Pelicot condemns machoism

<img alt="Gisele Pelicot arrives at the courthouse for the trial of her former partner Dominique Pelicot. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779937_1_20241119194127.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gisele Pelicot, the French woman drugged by her ex-husband so she could be raped and sexually abused by him and dozens of strangers, said on Tuesday that it was time for a "macho" society to change its attitude on rape.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivialises rape changes," said Gisele Pelicot in her closing statement at the trial of her ex-husband and dozens of other men on rape charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's time we changed the way we look at rape," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since early September her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot has been in the dock in the southern city of Avignon along with 49 other men. Another defendant is still at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has become a feminist icon by refusing to be ashamed and demanding the trial be open to the public to raise awareness about the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele, 71, said the marathon hearings marked a trial of "cowardice" on the part of the men who took part in the rapes organised by her husband.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen people take the stand who deny rape, and some who admit it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to say to these men: at what point did Mrs Pelicot give you her consent when you entered the room? At what point do you become aware of this inert body? At what point do you not report it to the police?"
  <br>
  <br>
  None of her abusers alerted the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can hear this gentleman saying 'a finger is not rape'," Gisele Pelicot added, in reference to testimony from another defendant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators have counted around 200 instances of rape, most of them by her husband and more than 90 by strangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele said her former husband "had a lot of fantasies that I couldn't fulfil".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But why did it come to this? I think what he wanted was Mrs Pelicot and not someone else," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As I didn't want to go to a swingers' club, he thought he'd found the solution by putting me to sleep."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've lost 10 years of my life that I'll never make up for," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This scar will never heal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The trial enters its final stages this week. Dominique Pelicot was also set to address the court before the civil parties' deliver their closing arguments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are then scheduled to give their closing arguments and make their sentencing demands for the defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the couple's three children spoke in court of their heartbreak and grief, with the daughter insisting she has been "forgotten" despite being also abused.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's daughter, who uses the pen name Caroline Darian, believes she was also assaulted by her father.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case of 71-year-old Dominique Pelicot has sparked horror, protests and a debate about male violence in French society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominique Pelicot has confessed to being a rapist. If convicted, he would emerge from the historic trial with a record as one of France's worst sex offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the co-defendants, only 14 have admitted the charges of aggravated rape, for which most of them face up to 20 years imprisonment if convicted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35 others deny having raped Gisele Pelicot and maintain that they thought they were taking part in sex games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele's life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilisers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him in their home in the village of Mazan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gisele Pelicot has said that for years she had strange memory lapses and other health problems and thought she might have had Alzheimer's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many hope that the trial will help victims of sexual violence to finally be listened to and believed, and lead France to inscribe the notion of consent into the definition of rape in French law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One for all," French daily Liberation said on Tuesday, putting a picture of Gisele on its front page and calling the trial "historic."
  <br>
  <br>
  The verdict is expected to be delivered by December 20 at the latest. (AFP)

 Electricity will cost slightly more for Hongkongers next year, with tariffs rising by 0.9 percent on Hong Kong Island and 0.98 percent in Kowloon and the New Territories.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city's two power firms, CLP and HK Electric, said even though fuel costs stabilised this year, ongoing geopolitical tensions meant they had to take on a more cautious approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Electric noted that it also needs to pump in extra resources to further boost service reliability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To handle more frequent extreme weather conditions, we need to improve our infrastructure so that we can still deliver reliable electricity to our customers even during bad weather. Also, we need to update our old and outdated facilities. All these investments will put pressure on electricity prices," its managing director Francis Cheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CLP's managing director, Joseph Law, pointed out that the company is dealing with challenges like inflation, rising material costs, and a tense labour force -- all of which are driving up its operational expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we understand that people are concerned about electricity prices, and we will keep working to improve our operating efficiency by managing our finances wisely and controlling expenses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While international fuel prices have stabilised somewhat over the past year, geopolitical risks remain, and global fuel costs are still relatively high, so the outlook isn’t too bright. We’ll continue to take a careful approach in managing our expenses."
  <br>
  <br>
  A climate economist said while the increases this time around are in line with estimates, he expects the tariff hikes to exacerbate in the years to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the international perspective, I would say there is still uncertainty about the fuel cost, especially the fluctuation in oil prices that might affect the future natural gas price. I think we should pay more attention," William Yu, CEO of World Green Organisation, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several lawmakers also raised concerns about the SAR's reliance on imported fuels, and urged the administration to speed up plans to find alternative energy supply sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Environment secretary Tse Chin-wan said in response that the government has been negotiating with mainland officials about boosting its zero-carbon energy supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that there's land set aside in Tseung Kwan O for receiving nuclear power and the project is scheduled for completion by 2035.

 China says foreign criticism of court sentences handed down on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far tramples on the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said no one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape legal punishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also said Beijing firmly supports Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consulate in Hong Kong said Washington strongly condemns the sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia said it was gravely concerned about the fate of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng, who was jailed for seven years and three months.

    '50 percent more tourists to join mega events in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it expects mega events in the first half of next year to attract 840,000 tourists, a 50 percent rise when compared with the same period this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference, officials said there will be more than 90 mega events in the first half of 2025, including festivals, conventions and sports events.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the events are expected to generate total spending of HK$3.3 billion, which would be a 40 percent increase compared to the first half of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about the cancellation of events due to poor weather conditions, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the government will have better arrangements by learning from the mainland and creating back-up plans for events like drone shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example for some of the shows, the original plan was to have 2,000 drones in a show, and they lowered the density to around 400. This allowed the show to continue to be carried out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will learn from them, so for some of the shows in the future, that will be one of the alternative options that we will prepare for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Culture and tourism minister Kevin Yeung, meanwhile, said it is inevitable that outdoor events such as the cross-harbour swim run the risk of being affected by the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted that tourists might feel disappointed with the cancellation of events, but dismissed worries that Hong Kong's reputation as a mega events hub could be damaged.

    Subversion case sentencing shows severity: Chris Tang

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the sentences handed down on Tuesday in the city's largest national security case to date reflected the severity of the offence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after the High Court court sentenced 45 people for conspiracy to commit subversion, Tang also told reporters that the government will look into individual cases before deciding whether to appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think different people may have different judgements about whether the sentencing is appropriate. But I think the important point is the rule of law," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, eight others, including former lawmakers James To and Roy Kwong, are currently on bail after they were arrested three years ago for participating in the unsanctioned Legco primary aimed at bringing down the government. They have yet to be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For every case, if we have sufficient evidence, we will arrest and we will prosecute," Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong told RTHK that the sentencing reflected the application of common law principles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One can see that the sentencing may not be as severe as a lot of people originally think, but it has its basis by reason of the fact that the court is effectively sentencing these defendants according to common law principles," Tong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One must still remember that we are talking about serious crimes... A conspiracy crime may simply involve a situation where the crime has yet to be committed. Nevertheless from the sentencing, one can see that the court will treat it seriously and I think people should be aware of this."

    'Govt to carefully review bus fare increase requests'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung on Tuesday said the government will carefully review fare increase requests from bus operators before making any decisions.
 <br>
  <br>
  KMB and New Lantao Bus are asking for 6.5 percent increases, while Citybus wants to put fares up by 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ll consider several factors, starting with how the public feels about it and the bus companies’ financial figures. We’ll also look at the services the bus operators offer. We will strictly play our gatekeeping role," Lam told reporters after attending a transport event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam added that officials will gather opinions from legislators and the general public as well as the Transport Advisory Committee, based on the existing mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legco's panel on transport is set to begin discussions on the matter on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lam also said implementing time-varying tolls for the Tai Lam Tunnel would be one of the many viable options when the government takes control of the infrastructure in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to present Legco the amendments to the tunnel's regulations by the end of this year and promised that the tunnel's tolls will be much lower than they are now.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of the defendants in Hong Kong's largest national security trial to date received the heaviest sentences among those considered "active participants" in the scheme aimed at bringing down the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former activist Owen Chow was given a jail term of seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng was jailed for seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho got seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan pointed out that Chow, 27, was one of the initiators of a pledge relating to the scheme, which "certainly pointed to the fact that [Chow] was putting every effort in binding the participants to ensure its success”.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had pleaded not guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow was already jailed over a riot case, and Tuesday's sentence will be served consecutively because the judges ruled that they were "separate and distinct incidents".
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Ng, who had also pleaded not guilty, the judges said the 46-year-old "willingly and intentionally" facilitated the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This was exemplified by the fact that he placed a full-page advertisement in Apple Daily on 3 July 2020 urging candidates who lost in the Primary Election not to participate in the LegCo election and asking people not to vote for anyone who had not participated in the Primary Election,” the judgement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, meanwhile, was the only defendant who did not submit mitigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  She had pleaded not guilty as well.

 A stress test will be conducted at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground on Saturday, with the police saying the aim is to test communication and trust levels between various departments through scenario-based exercises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Five hundred members of the public will take part, along with 4,500 civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Senior Superintendent Ng Tsz-fai said tests will cover ticket inspections, security checks, designated seating arrangements, emergency response, crowd control and MTR passenger flow management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drill team will... test the security inspection procedures and simulate emergencies to evaluate the collaboration capabilities between various departments. This is the first time that there will be five thousand people and designated seating, so we can test the time required for entry and the clarity of instructions," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the first exit test will begin at 5pm, with participants divided into groups of 1,000 and walking from the stadium to Sung Wong Toi Station. A second test will follow shortly afterwards, with participants walking to Kai Tak Station.
  <br>
  <br>
  MTR's Chief of Operating and Metro Segment Cheris Lee said trains will operate as usual, but there will be one-way only walking arrangements at the two stations during certain times.

 The High Court says the prison sentences it handed out on Tuesday in Hong Kong’s largest national security case so far were based not only on the 2020 National Security Law (NSL), but also on common law principles.

  <br>
  Forty-five people were given prison terms ranging from four year and two months to ten years for conspiracy to commit subversion, in relation to their involvement in unauthorised primary polls that were found to be part of a wider plot to seize control of the legislature and ultimately to overthrow the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, questions were raised as to whether the defendants should be sentenced according to the penalties laid out under Article 22 of the NSL, which makes no mention of the offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article mandates prison sentences of between 10 years to life in prison for those deemed “principal offenders”, three to 10 years for “active” participants, and lesser penalties for “other participants”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court decided that while the penalty banding is of “reference value, [it] should not be strictly applicable.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The judges said they also made reference to the common law offence of conspiracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, the starting points of the custodial sentences the court meted out to all defendants ended up being in line with the penalties mandated under Article 22 of the NSL.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When the court assessed the seriousness of the circumstances of the case, the prime focus was on the offender’s acts, as well as the actual consequences, potential risks and possible influence entailed”, the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  They stressed that the defendants were not sentenced for any acts prior to the enactment of the NSL in 2020, and no mainland sentences were used as a reference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench also rejected arguments that the scheme was doomed to fail and the defendants should be given lighter sentences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In order to succeed, the organisers and participants might have hurdles to overcome, that however was expected in every subversion case where efforts were made to overthrow or paralyse a government,” they wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this case, candidates for the primary election were essential [characters] of the scheme, without them, the scheme simply could not get off the ground. They lent their support to and actively participated in the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The bench added: “Had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government of the [Hong Kong SAR].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the four “principal offenders”, 41 other defendants were deemed "active participants” by the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them, jailed activist Owen Chow was jailed for seven years and nine months, Gordon Ng received a jail term of seven years and three months, and former journalist Gwyneth Ho was imprisoned for seven years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, as well as ex-hospital worker Winnie Yu, were each sentenced to six years and nine months behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another defendant, former student activist Joshua Wong, was slapped with a jail term of four years and eight months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court reduced his sentence by one-third for his guilty plea, but said it “did not consider him to be a person of good character” given his criminal records.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It should be noted that [Wong] committed the present offence while he was on court bail," the court said. “We did not think we should give further reduction because [Wong] could not have all the offences sentenced in the same proceedings. The sentence we passed on [Wong] also would not have a crushing effect on him.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those who were given the lightest sentences of four years and two months are former lawmakers Jeremy Tam and Claudia Mo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding Mo, the judges said they were “sympathetic to the ailing health” of her husband, Philip Bowring.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, the health condition of [Mo’s] husband is not a matter that can militate against the sentence to be passed on [Mo],” the judges said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some defendants were given sentence reductions after saying they didn’t know they were breaking the law when taking part in the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As to those who pleaded ‘ignorance of the law’ as mitigation, we were satisfied that they might have been misled by [Benny Tai] into thinking that the scheme was not unlawful”, the judges said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

    <br>
    <br>
    The summit will see the establishment of a special committee on AI, a think tank cooperation programme, and an international digital training institute.

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?

    <br>
    <br>
    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.
    <br>
    <br>

     </div>
     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

    Thousands march in NZ Maori rights protest

 Booming Indigenous Maori "haka" chants rang out across New Zealand's capital on Tuesday, as tens of thousands rallied against a conservative push to redefine the nation's founding treaty.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 35,000 demonstrators poured into the city of Wellington, police said, shutting down busy streets as their spirited procession inched its way towards parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bare-chested men draped in traditional feather cloaks were joined by horse riders waving the red, white and black Maori flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Children marched alongside adults bearing distinctive full-face Maori "moko" tattoos and clutching ceremonial wooden weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vibe is beautiful. People of all walks are here to support. It is peaceful and respectful," participant Nick Stewart told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Protests have been swelling throughout New Zealand after a minor party in the conservative coalition government drafted a bill to redefine the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the bill has almost no chance of passing, its mere introduction has triggered one of New Zealand's largest protests in decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many critics -- including some of New Zealand's most respected lawyers -- see it as an attempt to strip long-agreed rights from the country's 900,000 strong Maori population.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stand here gathered in our tens of thousands on the steps of parliament to protest this bill for our mokopuna," said Stewart, using a Maori word for future generations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowds gathered on the lawns outside New Zealand's beehive-shaped parliament building, playing reggae music and giving speeches that urged the government to come out and face them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not the best way to have a conversation. We will not accept unilateral change to a treaty that involves two parties," said Ngira Simmonds, a key advisor to New Zealand's Maori queen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many demonstrators arrived in Wellington after a nine-day "hikoi" -- or protest march -- that began hundreds of kilometres away at New Zealand's northern tip. (AFP)

    Tai, three others named 'principal offenders'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In handing down sentences for subversion to 45 opposition figures on Tuesday, the High Court named four of them as "principal offenders", with former legal academic Benny Tai deemed as the initiator of an unofficial legislative primary election in 2020 aimed at overthrowing the government.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tai received the heaviest jail term of 10 years among all defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three presiding national security judges – Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan – considered a starting point of 15 years behind bars for Tai, and reduced that by one-third after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “​​In short, [Tai] was not only the initiator of the scheme, but also an organiser of the primary election… He was the mastermind behind, hence could well be placed in the ‘[principal] offender’ category,” the judges wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Tai] might not be the one standing in the primary election or the actual Legco election, he however provided the necessary platform for those who intended to exercise the vetoing power under the scheme.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin and former district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were also named “principal offenders”.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had pleaded guilty and become prosecution witnesses in the trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio received jail sentences of six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  With starting points of 12 to 15 years in jail, the judges said the three had their sentences reduced for assisting the prosecution in the trial, as well as other mitigation factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng says Hong Kong must enhance its status as an international financial centre to fast-track the country's development as a financial powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering a speech at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit on Tuesday, he said Hong Kong has a pivotal role to play, with its robust financial system, growing appeal to investors and sound capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support more quality enterprises to list and issue bonds in Hong Kong. We will continue to expand mutual market access between the mainland and Hong Kong in areas such as stocks, bonds, financial management and interest rate swaps," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve the mechanism for the regular issuance of treasury bonds, steadily upscale the issuance in Hong Kong and support Hong Kong in consolidating its position as a global offshore renminbi business hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the central authorities will continue to support Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, enabling them to expand and enhance the city's financial development.

  "We will continue to deepen financial cooperation in the Greater Bay Area, and take forward the interfacing of rules and mechanisms between mainland cities in the GBA, Hong Kong and Macau in order to create more room for financial development in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The general principle is that so long as it is conducive to the plan of the central authorities, to the financial reform and development of our country and to the development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre, we will explore and implement it."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he hopes Hong Kong will continue to leverage its unique advantages, being backed by the motherland while connecting to the world, and will seize opportunities from the country's deepening reforms and Chinese modernisation while dovetailing with the national development strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said this will help Hong Kong contribute to high-quality national development, exemplifying the One Country, Two Systems principle on its journey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Forty-five people on Tuesday were sentenced from four years and two months to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit subversion in the city's largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirty-one of them pleaded guilty and 14 others were convicted in May for taking part in a plot to overthrow the government by securing a majority in the Legislative Council and indiscriminately voting down the administration's budget and spending initiatives to cause a constitutional crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The High Court sentenced former legal academic Benny Tai, who it said “advocated for a revolution” and masterminded the scheme, to 10 years in prison as a principal offender under Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL).
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others who were also deemed to be principal offenders for their roles in organising an unsanctioned Legco primary poll related to the conspiracy – former lawmaker Au Nok-hin, along with ex-district councillors Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung – were given jail terms ranging from six years and one month to seven years each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 41 others were all ruled to have been "active participants" in the plot, with the heaviest sentences meted out to Owen Chow – who was jailed for seven years and nine months – and Gordon Ng, who got seven years and three months. The lightest sentence given was four years and two months.
  <br>
  <br>
  In handing down the sentences, national security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan stressed that "had the scheme been carried out to the very end, the adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the Government of the HKSAR."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether the scheme would ultimately succeed, it was not for this Court to speculate," they added. "What we were sure was that all the participants had put in every endeavour to make it a success."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed that while the court looked into things that happened before the NSL was enacted on July 1, 2020 to assess the seriousness and extensiveness of the conspiracy, none of the defendants were actually sentenced for any acts they committed during this time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “However, they remained willing parties to that agreement and continued their participation in the scheme after it had been rendered criminal by the NSL”, they noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of the 47 defendants were acquitted earlier.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leaders from the Group of 20 major economies on Monday issued a joint statement highlighting the suffering caused by conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, while calling for cooperation on climate change, poverty reduction and tax policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  G20 leaders meeting at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for a two-day summit tackled an agenda that reflected a shifting global order, trying to shore up multilateral consensus before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, leaders at the summit were able to reach a narrow consensus on the escalating Ukraine war, focused succinctly on "human suffering" and the economic fallout of the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders' statement also expressed "deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip," and called urgently for more aid and protection for civilians along with a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit, and Moscow was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took marathon negotiations over the weekend for diplomats to finalise the joint statement, with debate over climate policy stretching into the dawn hours of Sunday, according to people involved in the talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In their statement, leaders agreed the world needs to reach a deal by the end of the United Nations Cop29 climate change summit in Azerbaijan on a new financial goal for how much money rich nations must provide to poorer developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cop29 officials had called on the G20 leaders for a strong signal to help breach the impasse on climate finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the joint statement said nations need to resolve the issue, they did not indicate what should be the solution at the UN summit set to end on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  As host of this year's G20 meetings, Brazil expanded the group's focus on extreme poverty and hunger, while introducing debate on cooperation to fairly tax the world's wealthiest – topics also highlighted in the leaders' joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva opened the summit on Monday with the launch of a global alliance to combat poverty and hunger, with backing from more than 80 countries, along with multilateral banks and major philanthropies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping also took the occasion to announce a raft of measures designed to support the developing economies of the "Global South," from scientific cooperation with Brazil and African nations to lowering trade barriers for least developed countries. (Reuters)
