 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government will seriously consider all opinions on the next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  With a public consultation under way on Sunday, Lee said Financial Secretary Paul Chan will give serious consideration to all the advice proposed for the upcoming budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of advice and opinions have already been provided," Lee told reporters ahead of the weekly's Executive Council meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The financial secretary has been doing this budget consultation for a number of years, and he will of course be taking serious attention to all the opinions and suggestions that are raised, examine the pros and cons, and also the reasoning and the thinking behind, so as to ensure that the eventual budget will satisfy the overall needs of Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am sure that the financial secretary will be paying heed to different opinions and analyse all the opinions very objectively and thoroughly to ensure that the best budget is prepared for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE told businesses to grasp opportunities, thanks to stronger visitor numbers and an increase in online shopping.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yes, we have a budget deficit, but already we have said that we will try to increase income, and also to reduce expenditure as well and to promote economic growth so the businesses will make more money, as a result of which the government will also have more income," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said the government will seek to make around HK$90 billion in investments each year, and he believes private investments will improve following a number of policies and measures launched by the central and SAR governments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has said the budget deficit for the current fiscal year could double to around HK$100 billion from an earlier estimate.

    Police warn Carousell users of bogus payment websites

<img alt="From left to right: senior inspector Victoria Ng, chief inspector Felton Leung and Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783810_1_20241217114145.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are urging users of the popular online trading platform Carousell to be vigilant against bogus payment links aimed at hacking into their bank accounts, with 644 cases recorded in the first 10 months of the year, incurring losses of HK$36 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The new tactic emerged as the force noted a 23.7 percent year-on-year rise in the overall number of online shopping scams during the same period, and the amount involved more than doubled to HK$332 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  To make transactions safer, Carousell introduced a Buyer Protection service in August, through which the seller only receives payment after the buyer confirms receipt of the goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  But senior inspector Victoria Ng of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said the number of scams surged after the service was rolled out, with 330 cases recorded alone between August and October, involving HK$25 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She explained scammers would pose as buyers and offer to pay for the item through the new payment system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers, after providing an e-mail address, would then receive a phishing link, which directs them to a website asking for details of their online banking account.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sellers could then withdraw all the money from the victims’ accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carousell chief of staff Tan Su-lin clarified users never have to surrender their e-mail address when using the payment system, let alone click on links.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In today's day and age, it's really a very risky behaviour to click on any links that you receive, whether it's via e-mail, or through your WhatsApp,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But not just sellers are being scammed - chief inspector Felton Leung noted buyers seeking sought-after items, such as concert tickets, can also fall prey to deception.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The scammers … play mind games with the victims. They knew that the victims want [the product] so much and it's so hard to get in any other places, so they will put on some time frame or time constraint on the victims. If they don't settle the deal as soon as possible, they will not get the tickets.' he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police advised buyers to stick to official or reputable sellers, and ask to trade in person whenever possible.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong is ready for an influx of tourists on New Year's Eve, with special border crossing and transport arrangements in place.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the government will ensure visitors have a smooth journey home after enjoying the 12-minute fireworks display.
  <br>
  <br>
  On December 31, most MTR lines will run overnight, and the Shenzhen Bay port will operate around the clock. The Lo Wu checkpoint will be open until 2am, instead of closing at the usual time of midnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the government, we will ensure that the whole arrangement for tourists to come to Hong Kong will be orderly, safe, and also it will be a pleasant experience, particularly when they go through the boundary control points," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that Hong Kong has seen a 20 to 30 percent increase in tourists from Shenzhen since the resumption of unlimited entry visas, and the trend is likely to continue through Christmas and New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the increase in the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong from different parts of the world, in particular those from Shenzhen, we have to ensure that first of all we will treat them nicely so that they all have a good experience and will think of coming back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lee said he will travel to Macau to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new term of the SAR government and congratulate Macau CE-elect Sam Hou-fai on taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping will also be in Macau from Wednesday to Friday to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's return to the nation.

<img alt="Relaxing its visa-free transit policy could further boost visits to China by foreign nationals. File photo: Imaginechina via AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783805_1_20241217111535.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced a relaxation of its visa-free transit policy, extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers to 240 hours, or 10 days, from 72 to 144 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as the country tries to attract more visitors, boosting post-pandemic travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective immediately, 21 additional ports have been designated for visa-free entry and exit, and the areas in which transit travellers can stay have been expanded, according to a statement from National Immigration Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the updated policy, eligible citizens from 54 countries, including Russia, Brazil, Britain, the United States and Canada, can enter China visa-free when transiting to a third country or region.
  <br>
  <br>
  These travellers may now enter through any of the 60 ports across 24 provinces, regions and municipalities, and stay within the designated areas for up to 240 hours. Cross-regional travel is being introduced, allowing foreign visitors to move freely across the 24 specified provincial-level regions during their 10-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  China recorded nearly 29.22 million inbound foreign visits in the first 11 months of 2024, up 86.2 percent year on year. Of these, 17.45 million entered the country visa-free, more than doubling the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since reopening its borders in 2023, Beijing has waived visa requirements for travellers to encourage visitation to the world's second largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the Foreign Ministry said China had extended its visa-free policy to a total of 38 countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 The Hong Kong stock market opened lower on Tuesday, with some investors apparently nervous ahead of a rate review in the United States.

  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.59 percent to 19,678.03 in the opening minutes.

    US players to be paid for competing at 2025 Ryder Cup

<img alt="Each member of Team USA is set to receive a US$200,000 stipend. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783776_1_20241217074639.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfers will be paid to play in the Ryder Cup for the first time after the PGA of America unveiled a program on Monday that will give each team member a US$200,000 stipend and US$300,000 to distribute to charity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The program will take effect with the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America said in a statement that its board of directors had voted on the move, which increases the US$200,000 that has been given to each player to distribute to the charities of his choice since the 1999 edition of the biennial match play showdown with Europe was held at Brookline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America added that no players had asked to be compensated, but the issue of pay for play in the prestigious event has reportedly been a source of tension within the US team in previous editions.
  <br>
  <br>
  USA Today newspaper cited a letter to past Ryder Cup captains from PGA of American president Don Rea, who said the stipend was added "out of respect for the players" and would be separate from what players receive for expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's recognition for all the players have done for the Ryder Cup over the years," Rea wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  When reports of compensation for US players surfaced last month, longtime European Ryder Cup stars Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy said they did not need financial incentives to give their all in the often emotional competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for us, we play for the badge and we also play for the European Tour," Rose said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Bethpage Black next year Europe will be defending the title they won in Italy in 2023, but they will be chasing their first victory in the event on US soil since the famous "Miracle at Medinah" in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players on the European Ryder Cup Team do not get paid for participating in the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament is scheduled for September 26 to 28, when the Americans will try to reclaim the trophy from Europe. (AFP/Reuters)

    Unal last-gasp denies West Ham at Bournemouth

<img alt="Bournemouth midfielder Enes Unal celebrates after scoring to draw level. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783775_1_20241217073802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bournemouth's Enes Unal provided a dramatic climax to his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday as the Turkey forward's superb late free-kick cancelled out Lucas Paquetá's penalty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paquetá looked to have sealed West Ham's second successive Premier League victory when he converted from the spot with just three minutes left at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unal came to the Cherries' rescue three minutes later with only his second goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old's moment of magic extended Bournemouth's unbeaten run to four games as they climbed to sixth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enes scored an amazing goal – he's a specialist. But it's only one point. I'm very disappointed with the penalty," Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said of the decision that went against his team for Tyler Adams' handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a play we analysed at a meeting before the season," he added. "The refereeing chiefs said players don't need to defend with hands behind their back in an unnatural position. It didn't affect the direction of the cross – I don't care about the explanation now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth have scored a league-high 10 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of those goals came in a remarkable 2-1 win at Ipswich in their previous game, with Unal also scoring Bournemouth's equaliser on that occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham have gone two games without defeat to ease a little of the pressure on boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suffered a little bit and overcame this to score, but it was an incredible goal from Unal. It's a pity," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are positives," he added. "This is the first step to be strong and a better team."
  <br>
  <br>
  They remain in 14th place and sit seven points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

 European champions England will renew their rivalry with France and the Netherlands, and also clash with debutants Wales in the group stage of the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament after the draw was made in Switzerland.

  <br>
  Eight-times European champions Germany, who are ranked third in the world, are in Group C with Poland, Denmark and Sweden.

  Despite being holders, Sarina Wiegman's England team were placed in Pot 2 of the draw after finishing second behind France by a point in their Euro qualifying group, with the two teams splitting their qualifying games with identical 2-1 scores.

  Adding more drama to what should be a blockbuster group stage, familiar foes the Netherlands – Wiegman's home country and former team – kept the Lionesses out of the Paris Olympics by finishing ahead of them in the Nations League. The two teams will meet on July 9.

 The tech-rich Nasdaq surged to a fresh record Monday at the start of a heavy week of economic news that includes a US Federal Reserve rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  Large gains by chip company Broadcom, Google parent Alphabet and some other tech names helped lift the index 1.2 percent to 20,173.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 43,717, while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 6,074.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments pointed to SoftBank's announcement that it would invest US$100 billion in the United States as being supportive of tech shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's renewed optimism in semiconductor and big tech stocks," Sarhan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said the market may take a breather until it receives key data points later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot to digest this week," Ablin said of a calendar that includes key retail sales and inflation data, as well as a Fed monetary policy decision. (AFP)

    TikTok turns to US Supreme Court to avert ban

<img alt="Tiktok faces January 19 deadline for its parent to sell the social media platform. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783758_1_20241217045330.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's January 19 deadline. A similar plea was expected from content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the US and significant advertising revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect January 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences because President-elect Donald Trump pledged during the campaign that he would “save TikTok.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that they can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, the justices could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April. (AP)

<img alt="Olaf Scholz has lost a key confidence vote, paving the way for new elections in February. (AFP)" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783753_1_20241217022834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote on Monday, spelling the effective end of his troubled government and putting Europe's biggest economy on the path to elections on February 23.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholz had called the vote, expecting to lose it, weeks after his coalition collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later Monday he asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to dissolve the legislature soon and ask voters to head back to the ballot box.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the centre-left chancellor continues in a caretaker role and with a minority in parliament, the political turmoil threatens months of paralysis until a new coalition government is formed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embattled Scholz, 66, lags badly in the polls behind conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz who heads the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of ex-chancellor Angela Merkel.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than three years at the helm, Scholz was plunged into crisis when his unruly three-party coalition collapsed on November 6, the day Donald Trump won re-election to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin faces major geopolitical challenges as it confronts Russia over the Ukraine war and as Trump's looming return heightens uncertainty over NATO and trade ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those threats were at the centre of a heated debate between Scholz, Merz and other party leaders ahead of the vote in the lower house, in which 207 MPs expressed confidence in Scholz against 394 who did not, with 116 abstentions. (AFP)

    Trump, SoftBank CEO announce US$100 billion investment

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump, with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at his side, announced on Monday that SoftBank would invest US$100 billion in the United States over the next four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said in his joint appearance with Son that the investment would create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and related infrastructure, with the money to be deployed before the end of Trump's term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the investment was evidence of "monumental confidence in America's future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$100 billion pledge, made at a flag-bedecked event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, fits in with Trump's vow to bolster the US economy and reduce the effect of inflation on Americans during his second term, which begins on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called Son "one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Monday announcement echoes a similar pledge Son made with then-President-elect Trump in December 2016 at Trump Tower, when Son said he would spend US$50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  While that money was eventually spent, it is unclear whether those jobs were created. The company has been rebuilding its finances after the failure of high-flying office-sharing start-up WeWork and after investors soured on some of the tech firms that it's invested in through its Vision Fund unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's unclear how SoftBank plans to fund the new investment. As of September 30, SoftBank had about US$29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent earnings report. After a sharp decline in shares between 2021 and 2023, its stock has recovered, gaining nearly 50 percent year-to-date. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Monday that Hong Kong has to fully support its innovative industry, in order to contribute to the country's drive for the development of new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an awards ceremony for the Science and Technology Innovation Prize, Chan said the SAR has been making use of its advantage as an international financial centre to provide capital support for the innovative industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that in the past couple of years, the government has attracted more than 100 firms to the SAR specialising in areas such as artificial intelligence and big data, biotechnology, as well as new energy and materials.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These companies will invest more than HK$50 billion in total in the coming few years, creating more than 17,000 jobs, many of which are research and managerial roles," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Lo, who chairs the Hong Kong Alliance of Technology and Innovation which gives out the annual awards, said the Hetao tech zone development between the SAR and Shenzhen will become a major cooperation platform within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that the country and the SAR government are going full speed ahead with building Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five laureates of the Science and Technology Innovation Prize this year are Chai Yang, associate dean of Polytechnic University's science faculty; Chinese University's medical school assistant dean Ng Siew-chien; mechanical and automation engineering professor Chen Shih-chi, also from Chinese University; along with City University's chemistry professor Zhang Hua and computer science scholar Wang Cong.

<img alt="Erick Tsang says the main purpose of the smart ballot box is to prevent votes that are filled out erroneously from becoming invalid. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783700_1_20241216164317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday sought to alleviate privacy concerns over the potential future use of smart ballot boxes that can detect invalid votes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang told lawmakers that officials are testing out the devices designed to help voters fill out ballot papers properly.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a Legco constitutional affairs panel meeting, the DAB's Chan Wing-kwong expressed concern over how the votes will remain confidential if the ballots are analysed by the smart boxes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Election Committee lawmaker Tang Fei said voters might feel embarrassed if they are informed they have made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said ballot-checking might amount to election interference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said the idea of bringing in the smart boxes is to protect voters' rights in the event that they inadvertently fill out ballots incorrectly, for example if a voter fails to tick the 40 boxes required for Legco's Election Committee constituency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not trying to identify voters who have deliberately defaced the votes. When people are actually casting their ballot, there is no CCTV involved, and you don't have to produce your ID card. And there is absolutely no way for us to identify who you are," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the privacy of voters is preserved. Our main purpose really is to reduce the situation where erroneously, voters tick the boxes leading to the vote becoming invalid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said similar technology worked well in two recent elections.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smart ballot box is included in proposed legal changes the government plans to table to the legislature by the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials have not decided in which elections the boxes can be used, with Tsang saying they might not be used in Legco polls next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey on Monday denounced an Israeli plan to double the population living in the occupied and annexed Golan Heights as a bid to "expand its borders".
 <br>
  <br>
  "This decision is a new stage in Israel's goal of expanding its borders through occupation," the foreign ministry said in a statement condemning the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's government on Sunday approved a plan to double the population of the annexed Golan Heights, just days after its troops seized a UN-monitored buffer zone bordering Syria as rebel forces moved on Damascus.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This step by Israel is a source of grave concern, taken together with Israel's entry into the area of separation in violation of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, its advance into adjacent areas and airstrikes in Syria," it said, warning the move would "seriously undermine" efforts to bring stability to Syria after Bashar al-Assad's ouster.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golan Heights is a mountainous plateau at Syria's southwestern edge, most of which was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is separated from the Syrian side by the UN-patrolled buffer zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the move was a "limited and temporary step" for "security reasons". (AFP)

 A medical research team found that people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to get viral infections, emphasising the importance of keeping blood sugar levels under control for better health.

  Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday they discovered a connection between high blood glucose levels and reduced immunity to viral infections in patients with type 2 diabetes.

  They analysed 40 blood samples from people with the condition at Queen Mary Hospital between 2022 and 2023, and found that Th1 cells, immune cells, from patients with poorly controlled diabetes had a significant 40 percent decrease in functionality compared with those from healthy individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Paul Lee, one of the researchers, said these patients need to improve their blood sugar management to help reduce the strain on healthcare systems during viral pandemics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it is important for these people to ask their clinicians what their glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are, or what their average blood sugar levels should be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They should first understand their glycaemic control, their diabetes control. [They should] know about their HbA1c level, in addition to having self-monitoring of their blood glucose, and to see whether their HbA1c level is already at target. If not, I think for those who are actually not very compliant to the medications, please adhere to the medications. And for those who are actually overweight, obese, try to optimise their body weight, improve their lifestyle, [have] more physical activity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These will all actually improve their sugar control. But of course, for those who have already done their best, they may have to discuss with their clinicians whether they need to add some more anti-diabetic agents to improve their HbA1c target."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the study paves the way for new treatment options aimed at enhancing the immunity of patients with type 2 diabetes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Fire Services Department on Monday said it has conducted more than 8,200 inspections at around 1,000 old buildings across Hong Kong, following a blaze at a residential block in Jordan in April that left five people dead.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said it issued more than 8,500 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices during the operation, and over 90 percent of these notices were complied with.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said most of the buildings checked were in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Eastern District, and Central and Western District.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Deputy Chief Fire Officer Wong Yuk-ping said the department will set up a special duty team to look at improvements for high-risk buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our goal is to reduce and ideally eliminate fire hazards. This is our ultimate objective," he told a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the work of our special duty team, we will consolidate our data and put high-risk older composite buildings on our inspection list. We will target these high-risk buildings and ensure a risk-based approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  The department said safety issues it found in the various buildings included smoke doors being left open or broken, and escape routes being blocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it carried out more than 350 prosecutions over buildings failing to comply with abatement notices.

    Time to review claw machine regulations: watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called for a review of claw machine regulations after seeing an increase in the number of complaints about the games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council received 42 complaints about claw machines from January to November this year, three times more than during the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Complainants alleged machine settings were manipulated, with pincers automatically loosening, and a minimum spend required in order to win a prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Chan, vice-chairman of the council's publicity and community relations committee, attributed the rise in complaints to the industry's growing popularity.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This market capitalises on the consumers' enthusiasm for testing their luck and attracts a dedicated clientele with a wide range of prizes. Because of the low operating costs and minimal entry barriers, these shops are getting more popular in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, a customer spent HK$500 trying to grab a prize over a period of 45 minutes, but received a box of trinkets instead of the displayed waffle maker prize he wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Claw machines are not regulated under the Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance, which means operators do not need a licence to open a shop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe it's about time, because of the popularity and also the growing concerns and issues that we found, it's about time to review whether we should regulate these kinds of claw machine businesses," said the council's chief executive Gilly Wong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Brazil's President Lula discharged from hospital
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was discharged on Sunday from a Sao Paulo hospital following emergency surgery to treat an intracranial hemorrhage.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am here in one piece... returning home calmly," the 79-year-old leader said as he made a surprise appearance at a news conference by his medical team at Hospital Sirio-Libanes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later smiled and waved to reporters as he left the hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula had successful surgery last Tuesday in which doctors drilled through his skull to relieve pressure that built up after a blow to the head in October, when he fell in a bathroom in his presidential residence in the capital Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent a follow-up operation on Thursday to minimise the risk of further bleeding in the affected area of the protective intracranial membranes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president can resume activities but will need to take it easy for 15 days, cardiologist Roberto Kalil said at the news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a risk of the worst happening," Kalil said later in an interview with the Globo television network.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula will remain in Sao Paulo until Thursday, when he will undergo follow-up tests. Once cleared, he will be able to return to Brasilia and his normal routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only restriction is physical exercise," said Kalil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another doctor, Ana Helena Germoglio, said Lula's recovery had "exceeded expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for his frenetic work pace, Lula burst into the news conference on Sunday without warning and approached the microphones, walking unassisted.
  <br>
  <br>
  He addressed reporters while wearing a fedora-style hat that covered signs of his operations, accompanied by his wife Rosangela "Janja" da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula's medical emergency started when he complained last Monday of a headache while in Brasilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  An MRI scan found a hemorrhage between his brain and the dura mater membrane that protects it, prompting his swift transport to Hospital Sirio-Libanes -- the country's top medical facility -- for surgery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I confess I was scared by the volume of fluid growth in my head. I was worried by the urgency of the request" to go to the hospital, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never think I'm going to die, but I'm scared, so I need to follow the rules," Lula said, adding he will not go to the beach for the end-of-year holidays, as many Brazilians do.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going home now," he told reporters, "calm, sure that I'm cured and that I just need to take care of myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  After suffering his fall on October 19, Lula had told an official from his Workers' Party that the accident was "serious."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the weeks following, the president skipped planned overseas trips.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from mid-November he resumed his active schedule, hosting a G20 summit in Rio and attending a Mercosur summit in Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest medical emergency adds to a list of health problems Lula has suffered over the years, including treatment in 2011 for throat cancer and a hip replacement operation last year. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An enhanced interactive exhibition dedicated to the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City has moved from the airport to Kai Tak's airside mall, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in the movie sets from  "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In".
 <br>
  <br>
  The second phase of the exhibition, which was inspired by the movie, opened on Monday and will run until April 13 of next year, featuring several new photo spots, hidden gems for photography, and dining and retail stalls, including the iconic char siu rice from the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said the exhibition's success at the airport demonstrated the strength of the SAR's movie tourism and local cultural exploration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The film industry in Hong Kong has great potential, especially when you consider that many of the filmmakers involved, both directors and screenwriters, are very young. The achievements they've made are highly commendable and have garnered much attention. Many critics have also recognised them. This is what makes me the happiest," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the government's perspective, we will continue to work hard to support the industry. In recent years, we have allocated about HK$4 billion into the Film Development Fund."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong added that an accompanying exhibition will be held at Kowloon Walled City Park, featuring a blend of both indoor and outdoor elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This exhibition is currently in the planning stages and also revolves around the 'Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In' theme. We are working hard to incorporate many different props. We hope to launch the exhibition in March or April of next year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, I'll keep some details under wraps, but further information will be provided by our colleagues from the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency."

    Hundreds feared dead after cyclone hits Mayotte

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior officials on Sunday said the death toll from Cyclone Chido's passage across Mayotte would be in the hundreds, perhaps even thousands, as France rushed rescue workers and supplies to the French island territory off Mozambique.
 <br>
  <br>
  Their efforts will be hindered by the damage to airports and electricity distribution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the cyclone's passage, clean drinking water was already subject to chronic shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand" deaths, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere.
  <br>
  <br>
  It would be "very difficult to reach a final count" given that most residents are Muslim, traditionally burying their dead within 24 hours, Bieuville added.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday pledged help from the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of Cyclone Chido through Mayotte," she posted on the social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are ready to provide support in the days to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also offered support, writing on X that his organisation "stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Sunday, the mayor of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, told AFP nine were in a critical condition in hospital, with another 246 more seriously injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The hospital is hit, the schools are hit. Houses are totally devastated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The storm had "spared nothing", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Establishing an accurate will be doubly difficult given that France's interior ministry estimates around 100,000 people live clandestinely on Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cyclone wiped out makeshift housing in the archipelago's shantytown, France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said late on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mayotte's 320,000 residents were ordered into lockdown on Saturday as Cyclone Chido bore down on the islands around 500 kilometres east of Mozambique, with gusts of at least 226 kilometres per hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already Sunday, medical personnel and equipment were delivered Sunday by air and sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prefecture in La Reunion, another French Indian Ocean territory some 1,400 kilometres away on the other side of Madagascar, said a first aid plane had landed in Mayotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  It carried three tonnes of medical supplies, blood for transfusions and 17 medical staff, authorities in La Reunion said, with two military aircraft expected to follow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just northwest of Mayotte, the Comoros islands, some of which had been on red alert since Friday, were also hit, but suffered only minor damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido made in Mozambique landfall early Sunday around 40 kilometres south of the northern city of Pemba, weather services said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The death toll there so far stands at three, said local officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unicef said it was on the ground in Mozambique to help the people hit by the storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyclone Chido is the latest in a string of storms worldwide fuelled by climate change, according to experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "exceptional" cyclone was super-charged by particularly warm Indian Ocean waters, meteorologist Francois Gourand of the Meteo France weather service told reporters. (AFP)

    South Korea's top court begins Yoon impeachment trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's Constitutional Court kicked off proceedings on Monday over the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has been suspended from office over his failed bid to impose martial law.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities are pushing to summon Yoon for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint investigative team involving police, an anti-corruption agency and the Defence Ministry said it plans to convey a request to Yoon’s office that he appear for questioning on Wednesday, as they expand a probe into whether his ill-conceived power grab amounted to rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Yeong-jo, an investigator with the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, said the team plans to question Yoon on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. He declined to provide specifics when asked how investigators would respond if Yoon refuses to appear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son said the team tried to deliver the summons request to the presidential office but was rerouted to Yoon’s personal residence after presidential secretarial staff claimed they were unsure whether conveying the request to the impeached president was part of their duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled National Assembly on Saturday over his December 3 martial law decree.
  <br>
  <br>
  His presidential powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Yoon is dismissed, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his martial law enforcement as a necessary act of governance against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party that he described as “anti-state forces” bogging down his agendas and vowed to “fight to the end” against efforts to remove him from office. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

    Choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully: watchdog

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday urged people to choose anti-dandruff shampoo carefully, after finding EU-banned substances in some products on the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog tested 25 anti-dandruff models and found that four contained zinc pyrithione (ZPT), which is banned in the European Union due to the potential harm to unborn children.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four brands are HAIR CORNER, Petal Fresh Pure, CLEAR and Philip B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, the council’s chief executive, said consumers should identify the root cause of dandruff before buying products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you have dandruff, you have to identify probably what is the reason. Is [your scalp] too oily, or maybe too dry, or other reasons? This is something as a first screening about yourself,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But on the other hand, if you have this problem for quite a bit of time, it's much better for you to seek medical advice before you continue to try on different products.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 90 percent of shampoo products also contained fragrance allergens, with two containing the EU-banned chemical BMHCA which can adversely affect both male and female fertility.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the watchdog said some products were not labelled at all or only included some fragrance allergens.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council urged manufacturers to review their formulas and improve labelling transparency.

    HA has 'zero-tolerance' over threats against staff

<img alt="The Hospital Authority says it is providing therapeutic support to its staff as well as improving protective equipment and attire. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783651_1_20241216111256.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority has reiterated its zero tolerance policy on workplace violence, including threatening staff and physical - or even verbal - abuse from patients.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dr Tung Chi-kwong, the authority's Workplace Violence Subject Officer of the New Territories West Cluster, told RTHK that cases of violence against staff fluctuated over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the authority hoped to minimise such incidents by appealing to the public for a greater understanding of the issues facing its staff, and to create a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this is a very valuable occasion for us to actually plead to public members that we will try to induce a mutual-respect culture in the workplace, and then hopefully it will improve communications and new ways to kind of de-escalate the tension," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said cases of violence were often related to a patient's expectations not being met, such as long waiting times, or issues with the treatment plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it was talking to frontline staff about their specific needs or the kinds of high-risk situations they faced, so it could provide tailor-made solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, we have been improving our designs of a forearm protector because one of the common injuries faced by our staff is when they have been doing some sort of routine nursing measures, like feeding or injection and so on. When our patients are in an abnormal mental state, they may consider the approach as threatening and sometimes they may have bitten or scratched our staff," said Dr Tung.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority said certain departments were more prone to violence, including psychiatry, geriatrics as well as the emergency room.
  <br>
  <br>
  Training was being given to staff from these departments, including break-away techniques to learn how to escape from dangerous situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Certain cases were also referred to the police, and the conviction rate was as high as 90 percent, the authority added.

    Beware of plasticisers in desk mats: Consumer Council
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday said that some desk mats commonly used as table protectors contain chemicals that can affect fertility or growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among 15 desk mats it tested, seven contained four plasticisers listed as reproductive toxicants exceeding a European Union limit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the worst example, plasticisers in a desk mat by Qivation surpassed the EU limit by 222 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The product has been referred to the Customs and Excise Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council also revealed that nine desk mats contain three other plasticisers that can affect children's livers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although people are unlikely to absorb plasticisers through their skin, they are at risk if they have a cut, or put on sunscreen or oil-soluble moisturising products after touching the mats, the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilly Wong, chief executive of the watchdog, urged the public not to use desk mats as place mats when they eat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Reason being is obviously the ingredients that they used [in desk mats] may not be at the food grade, so it's much better to segregate the usage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you select the product, you have to make it clear about the purpose of that product. So that you can make use of it, the function of it properly."
  <br>
  <br>
  The public should also wash their hands immediately after using the desk mats in other circumstances, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also called on manufacturers to be careful about what ingredients they use in products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to choose those that can safeguard the health of consumers and manufacture it with a very high quality control in order to produce products that shouldn't have harmful substances for consumers," she said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen delivered another barnstorming performance with two rushing touchdowns, as the Buffalo Bills handed the Detroit Lions only their second defeat of the season with a 48-42 NFL victory at Ford Field on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blockbuster clash between the two high-scoring potential Super Bowl contenders did not disappoint, with Bills quarterback Allen once again underscoring his credentials as the front-runner for this season's Most Valuable Player award.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who rushed for three touchdowns and threw three more in Buffalo's defeat to the Los Angeles Rams last week, was in commanding form with 362 passing yards from 23-of-34 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bills running back James Cook also played a key role with two touchdowns and 105 rushing yards, which included one 41-yard sprint to the end zone in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Buffalo were always in control after racing into an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Detroit's offence kept the Lions in touch – with quarterback Jared Goff throwing five touchdowns and 494 passing yards in a game that saw the two teams combine for nearly 1,100 yards of offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills improved to 11-3 with the win, while Detroit fell to 12-2 to leave the Lions tied in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles – who defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for 290 yards with two touchdowns, and rushed for one more to set up the Philadelphia win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for two touchdowns but suffered a late injury scare as Kansas City eased to a 21-7 win over the Cleveland Browns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes limped off the field midway through the fourth quarter of a win that leaves Kansas City on 13-1, putting them on course to secure post-season home-field advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes was uncertain as to the severity of the injury but said he could have played on if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually you have to wait until the day after to get a good sense of it," Mahomes said. "I could have finished the game in different circumstances." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A charity operating in the Eastern District is hoping to involve more ethnic minorities in community activities in the area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emily Yeung, an assistant social work officer at the Methodist Epworth Village Community Centre, Social Welfare, says many non-Chinese senior citizens live in Eastern District.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she told RTHK that a lot of them tend to stay at home and do not attend community events because of fear of not being able to communicate with others.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, the community centre is one of 11 beneficiaries of the Operation Santa Claus (OSC) charity drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charity was founded in 1963.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said with funding support from OSC, the charity will expand its “Narrating Life Stories - Supportive Project for Ethnic Minority Elders”, which trains volunteers to listen to the stories of ethnic minority elders.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our project, we have welfare assistants that they can speak in their languages so that the elders can know the programme, what is going on, and they can have someone to share with as well,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jointly organised by RTHK and South China Morning Post, OSC funds charitable projects that focus on children and youth, the elderly, the community, those with physical and mental disabilities, medical projects, and those concerning the environment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United scored two late goals to deepen the pain for beleaguered Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, as Chelsea moved just two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on a day of high drama in the English top flight, Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and Southampton boss Russell Martin were both sacked, paying the price for their teams' struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the marquee game of the day at the Etihad, City defender Josko Gvardiol opened the scoring, but Bruno Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot in the 88th minute and Amad Diallo struck two minutes later to seal a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions City – who have dominated English football over the past decade – now have just one win in 11 games in all competitions and Guardiola is desperately searching for answers.

  <br>
  "I don't have a defence, I'm the boss, I'm the manager – I have to find a solution, and I don't find a solution," said the Catalan after the low-quality encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a big club, when you lose eight out of 11, something wrong is happening," he added. "What can I say? The schedule is tough, the injured players? No. I'm the boss, I'm the manager and I'm not good enough – it's as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men trail leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand, by nine points and sit outside the Champions League places, in fifth spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-ravaged City were far from their best at the Etihad but appeared to be on course for a vital win as the clock ticked down against their neighbours before they self-imploded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Nunes' sloppy back pass was cut out by Diallo and the Portuguese midfielder then chopped down the United winger in his attempt to make amends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes coolly converted from the penalty spot to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo then raced onto a simple long ball over the top of City's flat-footed defence, finishing neatly to complete a remarkable turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win is a huge relief for new United boss Ruben Amorim, who had won just one of his first four Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for the fans it has a deep meaning, especially in this context, in this moment," the former Sporting Lisbon boss said after his first experience of a Manchester derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a difficult moment one week ago against Nottingham Forest at home with a storm," he added. "It was a really tough moment after the game. Today, we are more happy, but it's three points that we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  United finished the day 13th in the Premier League table – where they started – after Tottenham hammered bottom club Southampton 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca's high-flying Chelsea beat Brentford 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to close to within two points of long-time leaders Liverpool, who have 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home team dominated the first half and got the reward they deserved shortly before the break when Marc Cucurella nodded home Noni Madueke's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson doubled Chelsea's lead in the 80th minute and they held out for the win despite a late strike from prolific Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a fifth straight win for Chelsea, who look increasingly like being Liverpool's main challengers this season, with Arsenal and City faltering. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday posted the third-fastest time ever recorded for the women’s 200-metre freestyle event, clocking in a time of one minute and 50.62 seconds to capture gold at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, finished nearly a second faster than Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey, who clocked in a time of one minute and 51.49 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Claire Weinstein rounded out the podium to take bronze with her one-minute-51.62 second performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey's result stands just behind only her world record, set in 2021 in Abu Dhabi, and Swedish Sarah Sjostrom‘s one minute and 50.43 from 2017. She now owns four of the five fastest times in event history.
  <br>
  <br>
  With that result, the four-time Olympic medallist for the SAR now has four 200-metre freestyle world crowns – along with one other in the 100-metre event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey had recently announced she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

 Chief Executive John Lee greeted members of the public in Central and Wan Chai on Sunday evening, a day after concluding his duty visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  With his wife Janet Lam, Lee went to the Tai Kwun heritage-arts venue in Central, where he also talked with visitors from Shenzhen and South East Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Lee stopped by Lee Tung Avenue in Wan Chai, he chatted to passers-by and encouraged them to go out and spend during the festive season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The atmosphere is really good. We went to another place just now. The atmosphere there was good too," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You usually go out during the weekends, do you? Please go out more, so that our economy will be better. Merry Christmas!"
  <br>
  <br>
  On his official Facebook page, Lee said he enjoyed the festive atmosphere in both places.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that he welcomed tourists from all over the world, saying they could experience Hong Kong's unique charm and vibrancy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman has been bailed after she allegedly stole a sculpted model panda from a Kwun Tong public display on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Police said the 37-year-old was arrested in Sau Mau Ping on Saturday. She will have to report to police later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were called in after a security guard noticed that the model panda, valued at HK$100, had gone missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The model was part of an Urban Renewal Authority (URA) Christmas Celebration at Yue Man Square called 'Winter Transform'. It includes 80 giant panda installations, which range in height from half-a-metre to 3 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said another model panda had disappeared last Monday but that the case was not classified as theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  In announcing the display earlier this month, the URA said it features an industrial style panda and an astronaut panda - symbolising Kwun Tong's transformation from an industrial area to a modernised commercial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The URA said, after Christmas, the pandas would be displayed in festive Chinese New Year attire.

    Acting South Korean president moves to reassure allies

<img alt="Han Duck-soo spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783580_1_20241215193531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday to reassure the country's allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly," Han said, according to a statement from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a further attempt to stabilise the Asian nation's leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon's December 3 martial law decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures," Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors said Yoon did not appear on Sunday morning in response to a summons for questioning in a criminal investigation into his martial law decision, and they promised to issue another order, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, abuse of authority and obstructing people from exercising their rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutors' office did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, a longtime technocrat picked by the conservative Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon's case moves to the Constitutional Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Demonstrators seeking Yoon's ouster braved the cold to throng the streets outside the National Assembly building where he was impeached. The crowd was about 200,000, according to police, Yonhap said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Han's role is only acting president, "I hope he will exercise the minimum power to operate the country stably, rather than actively be involved in state affairs," said Jo Sung-woo, a 39-year-old Seoul resident.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 8.5 km away, a much smaller number of Yoon supporters demonstrated in the central Seoul area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really can't stand to see these illegal lawmakers who were elected by fraudulent elections making evil laws and now this huge opposition party is running wild on their own," said Yim Joung-sook, 55.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea's diplomatic partners, worried over the country's ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said in a statement that the US president "expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK," using the abbreviation for the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday's impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spoke by phone with the commander of US Forces Korea, expressing concern about the possibility North Korea could attempt military provocations, such as launching ballistic missiles or cyber attacks, Yonhap said, citing Han's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president," he said. "He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals."
  <br>
  <br>
  But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon. If he is removed or resigns, a new elections will be held within 60 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after the impeachment vote in parliament, which followed a failed vote a week earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic Party leader Lee said the most pressing issue is a slump in consumption caused by insufficient domestic demand and the government's reduction of its fiscal role.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a National Stability Council for Governance comprising the government and parliament to discuss finance, economy and public livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is necessary to promptly discuss a supplementary budget," Lee said, adding that such a measure could support for small businesses and investments related to artificial intelligence and infrastructure to try to head off energy shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Parliament, controlled by Lee's party, passed a 673.3 trillion won (US $470.6 billion) 2025 budget bill on Tuesday that cut the government's 677.4 trillion won proposal, without reaching agreement with Yoon's People Power Party and the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  By law parliament cannot increase government budgets, and at the time the Democratic Party said a supplementary budget could be needed to address spending for people's livelihoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The party said its cuts were mostly in reserve funds for the government, interest costs and funds allocated to the presidential office, prosecutors and auditors for classified operations. The government accused parliament of delaying projects for small businesses with the cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deadlock over budget issues was one of the justifications Yoon cited for imposing martial law.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's financial authorities vowed on Sunday to act as needed to stabilise markets while the finance minister said he would announce an economic policy plan by year's end. (Reuters)

    More and more fancy a shot at joining the police

 Police say more and more young people are now interested in joining the force and it aims to recruit another 400 officers and 80 inspectors in the next few months.
 <br>
  <br>
  With almost 6,000 vacancies across various departments, the force held a recruitment day on Sunday, giving people a taste of what it feels to like to wear the uniform, and even fire a gun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have set up a mock firearm experience station so participants can experience the shock of a pistol firing a bullet, and also see how police constables receive weapons training," Senior Superintendent Mike Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also set up a booth that consists of AI police uniforms, where participants can try on different police attire and take photos."
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost 1,300 people attended the event, with 400 submitting applications on the spot, the force said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said more than 9,000 applications for officer and inspector roles were received between April 1 and November 30, a 5.4 percent increase on the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 600 new officers were taken on, along with about 120 probationary inspectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see more and more young people being interested in police work," Kwok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether a relaxation in eligibility requirements from May 2023 contributed to the increase in applications, Kwok said the force is trying to "snatch talent".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope our market competitiveness will suit societal demands. Of course we would want as much applicants as possible. But I think the increase was mainly due to people being interested in the job as we have held a lot of recruitment activities in local and mainland universities," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Domestic worker groups on Sunday warned that a lack of knowledge on rights and legal protections is leading to some helpers being abused in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions (FADWU) and the Union of Nepalese Domestic Workers in Hong Kong (UNDW) said that in the past two years, they received eight complaints from South Asian workers who had been severely underpaid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarah Pun, an executive member of FADWU and vice-chairwoman of UNDW, said many workers are only being paid HK$1,000 to HK$4,000 per month, when the minimum wage is HK$4,990.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Some of] the workers in Hong Kong don't know any rights of what is their proper salary and what is their contract salary, so some employers take advantage," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our South Asian [domestic workers], don't have an agent in Hong Kong. The broker will tell them to come to Hong Kong because all those who want to come to Hong Kong, they also want to earn the money for themselves to support the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do some agreement, I think, with some amount, but they will not tell the worker the proper amount of the contract salary. So, they will just tell them that the only important thing is the job."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Nepali woman who turned to the groups for help told reporters that she was not paid her full salary, had her passport confiscated by her employer, and suffered constant mental and physical abuse.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They did not provide me proper food. They did not provide me a room, no bed. I had to sleep on a [sofa]. They did not give me any rest days. There were no fixed working hours. I had to work 24 hours. That was what I was told," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They always found fault in my work and they were always complaining. They used to scold me with foul language and assault me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pun said the government should arrange mandatory training for both incoming helpers and employers, to increase awareness of responsibilities and fair wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the authorities should ensure that migrant domestic workers are aware of their rights and how to seek justice in the case of violations.

    'Bali Nine' drug smugglers return home: Australia

<img alt="Some of the 'Bali Nine' were held on death row in Kerobokan prison in Denpasar. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783560_2_20241215151025.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's government said on Sunday that five members of the "Bali Nine" drug ring have returned from Indonesia, after diplomatic efforts between the countries this month to strike a repatriation deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian Government can confirm that Australian citizens, Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj have returned to Australia," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men were among nine people arrested in 2005 trying to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin out of the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These Australians served more than 19 years in prison in Indonesia. It was time for them to come home," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of ringleaders of the Bali Nine group, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed in 2015, prompting Australia to recall its ambassador in protest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only woman in the group was released from prison in 2018, and a male member died of cancer the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to convey our deep appreciation to the Government of Indonesia for its cooperation to facilitate the men's return to Australia on humanitarian grounds," Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the men's return reflected "the strong bilateral relationship and mutual respect between Indonesia and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The men will have the opportunity to continue their personal rehabilitation and reintegration in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's Senior Minister for Legal Affairs Yusril Ihza Mahendra this month met Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke in Jakarta and handed over a draft proposal for the return of the five prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the draft included the five being banned from returning to Indonesia, regulations on the legal basis for the transfer and a requirement that Australia respect the decision of the Indonesian court, Yusril said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yusril said at the time that Indonesia would respect any decision taken by Australia when the prisoners returned home, including if the group was granted a pardon. He said the repatriation would not involve an exchange of prisoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indonesia's government did not respond immediately to requests for comment on Sunday. (Reuters)

    Teen stabbed to death in Japan fast-food restaurant

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese police were searching on Sunday for the attacker who fatally stabbed a junior high school student and wounded another at a McDonald's restaurant, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teens were in line to order around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the attacker entered the fast-food restaurant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, and wordlessly stabbed them both, according to national broadcaster NHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were rushed to hospital where the girl later died. The other victim, a boy, survived and told police he did not know the man who had stabbed them, NHK said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear whether the girl knew the man, who remained at large on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dozens of police have deployed to find the attacker, described as a man who appears to be in his 40s, wearing a grey jacket and dark pants, according to Television Nishinippon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attack happened in less than a minute, local media reported, adding that around 10 customers were inside the restaurant at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Violent crime is rare in Japan, which has strict gun control laws. But there are occasional stabbings and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2019, two people, including a schoolgirl, were stabbed to death and more than a dozen wounded in the Japanese city of Kawasaki in a rampage by an attacker who targeted children as they waited for a bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 51-year-old attacker slashed at a group of children before fatally stabbing himself. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday urged Hongkongers to "team up for a brighter future" as he invited people to put forward suggestions for his next budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  A consultation exercise ahead of the blueprint expected in February got underway on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes after the government doubled its estimated deficit for the current financial year to around HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said the government has to carefully manage public finances as the global outlook remains gloomy and the city is undergoing economic transformation. But he added that accelerating the city's economic development is of equal importance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During this period, development is core and stability is the key. The administration has been seeking to expand into new markets and strengthen its position in technological innovation. Results of this are now beginning to flow through," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's make wise use of resources, and team up for a brighter future," he added, in a promotional video on the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chan said the city's market sentiment has been improving, with the central government continuously rolling out measures to support Hong Kong, including bringing back unlimited entry visas for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 130,000 mainlanders visited the SAR last weekend, Chan said, adding that this was a 15 percent increase on the average number in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the number of innovative technology start-ups in the city is continuing to grow and a lot of enterprise founders from across the world agree that Hong Kong has a unique advantage in innovation and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign companies are confident towards Hong Kong. The government's efforts overseas in promoting the city's advantage and telling real Hong Kong stories are yielding positive impacts," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Challenges are inevitable in each development stage, but we have to focus on greater opportunities and prospects. According to our past experiences, Hong Kong remains strong despite highs and lows, and we will continue to make steps forward in new developments and reach newer heights," he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperatures struggled to reach 15 degrees Celsius across much of the city on Sunday morning, as the observatory warned of the coldest day so far this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  A low of 13 degrees was recorded at the forecasters' headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was even colder in parts of the New Territories, the observatory said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A strong northeast monsoon will affect the coast of southern China today. Since it will be windy, wind chill effect will be particularly significant on high ground and exposed areas. People are advised to be aware of the change in weather and keep warm when engaging in outdoor activities," it warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The observatory added that daytime temperatures are expected to rise this week, but mornings will still be cool.

    ABC faces US$15mn payout over Trump lawsuit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 ABC News will pay a US$15 million settlement payment to resolve a defamation lawsuit brought by President-elect Donald Trump, according to court documents filed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit stemmed from on-air comments made by top anchor George Stephanopoulos, who said Trump was found "liable for rape" during an interview with US Representative Nancy Mace that aired in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The terms of the settlement require ABC News to make a US$15 million donation to a fund dedicated to "a presidential foundation and museum" for Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news organization and Stephanopoulos will also issue public apologies saying they "regret statements" made about Trump during the aforementioned interview, and the broadcaster will pay an addition US$1 million in attorney fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case was settled one day after Judge Lisette M. Reid requested depositions from both Trump and Stephanopoulos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had been found liable for sexual abuse -- a different transgression from rape under New York law -- in a 2023 case filed by writer E. Jean Carroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  The settlement marks the latest legal victory for Trump since winning the November 5 presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a US appeals court granted the dismissal of charges for Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents upon exiting the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Special Counsel Jack Smith also paused a second federal case regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election results, although Trump faces racketeering charges over the same issue in a case out of Georgia.
  <br>
  <br>
  And for Trump's May conviction in the hush money case -- the only criminal charges against him to go to trial -- Judge Juan Merchan has indefinitely postponed sentencing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<img alt="Joel Embiid (21) drives for a shot past Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783507_1_20241214203457.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand have arrested two men following a bomb blast at a festival near the border with Myanmar that killed three people and wounded dozens, police said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An improvised explosive device went off on a dance floor at a festival in Umphang district in Thailand's northern Tak province on Friday night, according to local police.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people were killed instantly and another died later in hospital, police said. The explosion also injured 48 people among approximately 8,000-9,000 attending the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai police said they had arrested a Thai youth and a man they said was a member of the Karen National Union (KNU), an ethnic minority rebel group that has fought the Myanmar military for decades for autonomy in neighbouring Myanmar's Karen state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tak police chief Major-General Samrit Ekamol said the Myanmar suspect had thrown the bomb after encountering a "rival gangster" he had previously fought with.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior KNU denied any involvement and said the group did not have any members in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The KNU can call on more than 5,000 fighters, maintains close links with the Thai police and military, and has extensive business interests on both sides of the border, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra expressed her condolences to the victims and their families, and urged security agencies to carry out an investigation. (AFP)

 Georgia's ruling party on Saturday installed a far-right loyalist as the country's president in a controversial election process amid a constitutional crisis and after weeks of mass pro-EU protests.
 <br>
  <br>
  An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected former Manchester City striker Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the country's next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote "illegitimate" and refused to step down. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A UN envoy on Saturday urged foreign powers to work to avoid a collapse of vital Syrian institutions following the downfall of leader Bashar al-Assad, as diplomats gathered in Jordan for a conference on the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geir Pedersen, the UN's special envoy for Syria, also backed a "credible and inclusive" political process to form the next government as he met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure that state institutions do not collapse, and that we get in humanitarian assistance as quickly as possible," Pedersen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we can achieve that, perhaps there is a new opportunity for the Syrian people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top Arab, Turkish, EU and US diplomats are holding talks in the Jordanian Red Sea resort city of Aqaba less than a week after Islamist-led rebels toppled Assad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blinken, on a trip in which he met the leaders of Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, has repeatedly called for an "inclusive" process that reflects all the diverse ethnic and religious communities in Syria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meeting Pedersen, Blinken said the United Nations "plays a critical role" in humanitarian assistance and protecting minorities in Syria. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau has elaborated on the plan to reform the healthcare system due to population and demographic changes - specifically boosting health management efficiency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau earlier pointed out that even though the overall population in the SAR will increase in 2041, that's not the case for Hong Kong Island, which might drop slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the key components of the plan, is the merging of Hong Kong East and West hospital clusters, which the health chief said would improve efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking after an RTHK radio programme on Saturday, Lo said the move aims to utilise resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're looking at merging the Hong Kong East and West clusters to co-care for 1.2 million people on Hong Kong Island. This will improve management and administration efficiency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of medical services, it will allow the two to have a strong collaboration through increased cooperation in terms of training and service."
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that services offered by Eastern Hospital would remain unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the bureau is also looking into adjusting public hospital charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo revealed that critical and emergency patients might be charged less, noting that the government is responsible for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for semi and non urgent patients, he said the authority will offer more a precise subsidy for them.

 South Korean lawmakers on Saturday voted to remove President Yoon Suk Yeol from office for his failed attempt to impose martial law last week.

  Out of 300 lawmakers, 204 voted to impeach the president on allegations of insurrection while 85 voted against.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three abstained, with eight votes nullified.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is now suspended from office while South Korea's Constitutional Court deliberates whether to uphold his removal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Han Duck-soo steps in as the interim president.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court now has 180 days to rule on Yoon's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  If it backs his removal, Yoon would become the second president in South Korean history to be successfully impeached.
  <br>
  <br>
  For weeks, thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets of Seoul to demand Yoon’s resignation and jailing after his short-lived martial law declaration sent soldiers and helicopters to parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmakers quickly responded, breaking the military cordon and assembling in parliament to vote down the declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, prosecutors said they had arrested a military commander who headed the capital defence command.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arrest warrants were also issued by the Seoul central district court for the national police chief and the head of the city’s police, citing the “risk of destruction of evidence”. (AFP/Agencies)

 People flocked to Victoria Park to enjoy one of Hong Kong's largest outdoor fairs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association, the Brands and Products Expo opened on Saturday and will run until January 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's event saw 900 booths set up, with some offering discounts, including HK$1 special deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman said she had not been to the fair for many years, and this time, she bought a bag of medicinal herbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a steal. I didn't line up for too long. You can't imagine how happy I am because I got so many things for just HK$1. It would originally cost at least HK$100," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another woman said she arrived at the venue four hours early to make sure she got what she was looking for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Abalones and fish maw. I will make soup and other delicious dishes. It's almost new year and also the winter solstice," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan also visited the expo, and bought soup packs, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimps and egg rolls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman Wingco Lo said Hong Kong's retail market had been facing various challenges, but with the festive atmosphere and the resumption of the multi-entry visas for Shenzhen residents, he's confident with the sales from the fair.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday wrapped up his four-day duty visit to Beijing, making a last stop at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in the capital before returning home.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, alongside Chief Secretary Eric Chan who arrived in Beijing on Friday, met Wang Xiaoping, the minister of human resources and social security, as well as other mainland officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a government statement, the two sides exchanged views on issues such as the integrated development of education, scientific and technological innovation, and building the SAR into an international hub for high-calibre talent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee reported to the minister that the idea of the committee came from President Xi Jinping, who “pointed out that education development, scientific and technological innovation, and talent cultivation should be promoted as an integrated effort”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He said he hopes that the [Hong Kong] SAR government can create joint forces with the ministry in serving the country’s workforce development strategy and make greater contributions to building a great country in all respects through Chinese modernisation,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the chief secretary, who chairs the committee, said the group would leverage Hong Kong’s strategic positioning and advantages in its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The committee held its first meeting on Friday and agreed to review and improve existing schemes on attracting high-performing individuals.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong said the debut of pandas An An and Ke Ke have boosted the atmosphere at the park, and he expects the facility to see more visitors during festive holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two pandas gifted by the central government earlier made their first appearance to the public, and Pong said tourists from both home and abroad have been lining up to spend time with the animals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a television programme on Saturday, the chairman said the park was ready for a visitor boom in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "December is always a peak. We normally expect more visitors during Christmas and Chinese New Year, and now people are eagerly looking forward to visiting the giant pandas. We know they're going to visit the park during these festivals, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said Ying Ying's baby twins are expected to greet visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether visitors would have to pay extra to see the twins, Pong said he had not considered it yet, but stressed that ticketing is integral for Ocean Park's income.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ocean Park Water World has been closed for a seasonal break this winter, instead of keeping its doors open all year round as usual.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pong said this allowed better allocation of manpower, so that more staff could help out at Ocean Park when the Water World was having a slack season.

    'HK can expand its market in developing EV'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The transformation into green transportation is a new opportunity for Hong Kong to expand its market in developing electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Tse Chin-wan, who told a radio programme that while many countries and regions are promoting green transportation, not many places have double-decker buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities earlier announced a green transformation roadmap of public buses and taxis, with plans to subsidise the purchase of electric buses and taxis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The environment chief stressed that it's worth investing as Hong Kong can make use of the advantage and expand its market in the technology that's involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This green transformation actually provides opportunities under the establishment of a new economy... If we use subsidies to help double-decker buses develop the technology, we can grasp the opportunity," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international city and we can set an example for other places."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government shelved the pay-as-you-throw scheme earlier this year, and though some green groups say the scheme should still be rolled out at some point, Tse noted that the authorities would continue to promote waste reduction and recycling rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there are different means to do so, but the ultimate aim is to establish a green-focused culture in society.

 The newly appointed Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism expects Hong Kong to see 45 million visitor arrivals by the end of 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier estimated that the region would welcome 46 million tourists by year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Rosanna Law pointed out that the tourism sector has been doing quite well recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said that during the first 11 months of the year, the SAR rolled out the red carpet for around 41 million travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the resumption of the multi-entry visa scheme [for Shenzhen residents], daily visitor numbers have been between 7 to 8 percent higher than the average for November," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially on weekends, average figures have increased by 30 percent, year-on-year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law, who said she felt "a great responsibility" in her new role, emphasised that various industries should make good use of the benefitting measures offered by the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the secretary also assured travellers that the government has already geared up for New Year's Eve celebrations, to ensure that mainland visitors have a smooth journey back home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had earlier announced that opening hours of border crossings will be extended that day, and most MTR lines will run overnight.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)
