<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's arrested President Yoon Suk Yeol does not intend to take part in a second day of questioning on Thursday, his lawyer said, further stonewalling a criminal probe into whether he committed insurrection with his martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon, the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested, was taken to the Seoul Detention Centre on Wednesday evening after refusing to cooperate, where he was expected to have spent the night in a solitary cell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have 48 hours to question the suspended president, after which they must release him or seek a warrant to detain him for up to 20 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's refusal to cooperate with investigators comes as the Constitutional Court is due to hold a second hearing in his impeachment trial to determine whether to remove him permanently or reinstate his presidential powers.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea is grappling with a political crisis sparked by Yoon's brief attempt to impose martial law on December 3 that was voted down by parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's arrest on Wednesday ended a weeks-long standoff with authorities after police swooped before dawn on his fortified hillside villa in Seoul to the despair of followers at the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he turned himself in for questioning by corruption investigation officials to prevent what he called the risk of "unsavoury bloodshed", though he continued to protest that it was an illegal investigation and invalid arrest warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has up to now refused to talk with investigators who had prepared a questionnaire of more than 200 pages, an official from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) that is heading the criminal inquiry said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader did not even reply to a question, a CIO official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  His questioning is due to resume at 2 pm local time, on Thursday, according to CIO.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yoon Kab-keun, one of Yoon’s lawyers, said in a text message to reporters that Yoon would not show up for the questioning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yonhap reported the same lawyer as citing Yoon's health as a factor and saying further questioning was pointless, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CIO official said he understood it was possible to forcibly bring Yoon for questioning but would make further checks on relevant laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small crowd of protesters supporting Yoon gathered and sat on a road outside the CIO office, calling the president's arrest illegitimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Opinion polls show a majority of South Koreans support impeaching Yoon, but the attempts to arrest him appear to have rallied his hardcore supporters. (Reuters)

 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Firefighters reported significant gains on Wednesday against the two massive wildfires burning around Los Angeles, while also extinguishing smaller blazes set by arsonists in recent days as a final round of windy, flame-fanning weather moved through Southern California.
 <br>
  <br>
  A Particularly Dangerous Situation red-flag warning expired in the afternoon, but dry conditions and gusty winds were forecast to linger into Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  So much of the nation’s second-most populous metropolitan region remained on alert for new outbreaks and flare-ups from the fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Wednesday, gusts whipped up to 80 kph in the mountains, though many areas saw relatively light winds late in the morning, according to the National Weather Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  Better conditions expected in the coming days should help fire crews make even more headway and allow residents to return to their neighbourhoods to begin rebuilding.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, firefighters and police faced new challenges. Since the beginning of the wildfire outbreak last week, authorities have arrested about half a dozen people accused of setting new, small fires that were quickly knocked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have not determined a cause for the major blazes in what is on track to become the nation’s costliest fire disaster.
  <br>
  <br>
  More manageable winds on Tuesday allowed firefighters to make gains on the two most destructive fires. Almost half of the Eaton Fire just north of LA was contained, and one-fifth of the fire that destroyed much of the seaside neighbourhood of Pacific Palisades was surrounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of those broke out on January 7. (AP)

    Biden warns dangerous oligarchy taking shape in US

<img alt="US President Joe Biden delivers his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787768_1_20250116095646.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Joe Biden urged Americans on Wednesday to "stand guard" against threats from oligarchs, disinformation and AI in a future under Donald Trump as he delivered a dark farewell address ahead of stepping down next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden, who will be succeeded by Trump on Monday, touted his achievements in steering the US economy out of the deep crisis inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and said he had made the nation's alliances abroad stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, in his brief Oval Office speech on live television, the Democrat quickly turned to painting a series of dangers facing the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clearly referring to Trump's close ties to the world's richest man Elon Musk and other tech tycoons, Biden said an "oligarchy is taking shape in America" - and "a dangerous concentration of power."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the ultra-rich around Trump represented a concentration of "extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden recalled the stark warning issued by president Dwight Eisenhower in his own farewell address in 1961 about the dangers of an out-of-control military industrial complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech industrial complex," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a "crumbling" media means Americans are increasingly vulnerable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation, enabling the abuse of power," the outgoing president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also clearly referring to Trump's plans to roll back environmental protections and withdraw from a major international global accord on combating global warming, Biden said "powerful forces want to wield their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we've taken to tackle the climate crisis, to serve their own interest for power and profit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Naming another increasingly global challenge, Biden said artificial intelligence "is the most consequential technology of our time" that could bring huge benefits but also poses "risks for our economy and our security, our society." (AFP)

    UK report says patient safety is being compromised

 UK patients are "coming to harm" as nurses say they are having to treat people in corridors and unsuitable places because of a "collapse in care standards", a report said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the latest indictment of Britain's beleaguered state-funded National Health Service, nine in 10 NHS nurses surveyed by the country's nurses union said "patient safety is being compromised".
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly seven in 10 said they were delivering care in "overcrowded or unsuitable places" on a "daily basis", including in corridors, converted cupboards, car parks and even bereavement rooms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The experiences of over 5,000 nursing staff across the UK highlight a devastating collapse in care standards, with patients routinely coming to harm," said the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).
  <br>
  <br>
  The report condemns the "normalisation" of so-called "corridor care", with nurses unable to access life-saving equipment in cramped spaces and patients even dying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  One nurse in east England said corridor care in their hospital trust was "not an exception, it's the rule".
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, some 54,000 patients in emergency departments in England had to wait over 12 hours until a hospital bed was available, up 23 percent from December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the RCN report testimonies are accounts of nurses treating up to 40 patients waiting in a corridor, as well as reports of pregnant women miscarrying in corridors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some reported overcrowded corridors impeding them from giving life-saving resuscitation (CPR). One nurse recalled a patient dying after a cardiac arrest "by the male toilet".
  <br>
  <br>
  Another alleged having to treat cardiac arrests "with no crash bell, crash trolley, oxygen, defibrillator... straddling a patient doing CPR while everyone watches on".
  <br>
  <br>
  There are some 7.5 million people on the NHS waiting list, with more than three million having faced delays longer than 18 weeks for treatment. (AFP)

    Indonesia to push social media protections

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia is planning to impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Communications minister Meutya Hafid has said the government plans to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they fail to prevent children from accessing their platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law," said Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the meantime, he said the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection - how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils," he said, adding that the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents," she said, adding the law must be strict and clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful not to curb their right to information.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 50 percent of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet, with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association. (Reuters)

<img alt="People watch the live television broadcast of a press conference being addressed by Qatar’s Prime Minister along a street in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787744_1_20250116063153.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds of Gazans chanted and embraced on Wednesday as news spread that a ceasefire and hostage release deal had been reached between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending more than 15 months of war in the Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a US official and a source close to the negotiations first revealed the agreement, Israel cautioned that several points "remain unresolved" that it hoped would be addressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But celebrations were already underway in Gaza, where journalists saw crowds of people hugging and taking photos to mark the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe that this nightmare of more than a year is finally coming to an end. We have lost so many people, we've lost everything," said Randa Sameeh, a 45-year-old who was displaced from Gaza City to the Nuseirat Camp in the centre of the territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need a lot of rest. As soon as the truce begins, I will go to the cemetery to visit my brother and family members. We buried them in Deir el-Balah cemetery without proper graves. We will build them new graves and write their names on them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside Deir al-Balah's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where so many of the war's casualties have been taken, hundreds of Palestinians gathered to chant, sing and wave flags, AFPTV footage showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one point, a member of the crowd and a journalist in body armour were raised on people's shoulders to conduct an interview above the mass of elated Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, The "final details" of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal are still being worked on, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the early hours of Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to US President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to thank them for helping to secure a deal for the release of hostages held in Gaza, his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said at least 20 people were killed in Israeli strikes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was announced on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a stirring fightback to beat Tottenham 2-1 in the north London derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Son Heung-min's early opener at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they seized the bragging rights against their bitter rivals thanks to Dominic Solanke's own goal and Leandro Trossard's strike just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's first win in four games in all competitions lifted them within four points of leaders Liverpool, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's game in hand on Arsenal still makes them title favourites, but the Gunners are at least applying some pressure on Arne Slot's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 2-0 by Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg last week and eliminated from the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, Arsenal were desperate for a response and Tottenham once again proved their ideal opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions have been asked of Arteta's ability to add more silverware to the 2020 FA Cup, which remains the only trophy of a reign that started in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka already sidelined due to hamstring surgery, Gabriel Jesus's potentially season-ending knee injury had added to Arteta's woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal have now won seven and drawn one of their last eight league games against Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team are now on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted," he said. "When you have opportunities to close the gap, you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was another painful blow for under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are just eight points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We let Arsenal dictate the game," Postecoglou said after the match. "Second half was a little better but nowhere near good enough – not acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou must find a solution to the inconsistency that saw them beat Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg before needing extra-time to see off fifth tier Tamworth in the FA Cup third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a win in their last five league games, losing four of those to drop to 13th place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raheem Sterling wasted a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead in the opening moments when his heavy touch allowed Djed Spence to clear after the winger raced through on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking wracked with nerves, Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky was fortunate not to gift a goal to Arsenal on his Premier League debut after taking too long to clear, with Kai Havertz unable to apply the finishing touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alexander Isak fired Newcastle into the Premier League's top four after scoring twice in a 3-0 cruise against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Isak found the net for the eighth league match in a row as the Magpies leapfrogged faltering Chelsea into fourth spot in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international put the home side ahead in the 34th minute when his shot took a huge deflection off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, leaving Jose Sa wrong-footed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak doubled Newcastle's lead shortly before the hour mark, controlling Bruno Guimaraes' pass before firing home for his 15th league goal of the season and Anthony Gordon added a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, who have now won six straight league games, have recovered strongly from a lengthy poor spell to make a powerful case for a Champions League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking advantage of the faltering form of Manchester City and Chelsea, they are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, David Moyes' return as Everton manager failed to muster a response from the toothless Toffees in a 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins' winner early in the second half lifted Villa up to seventh, just three points off the Premier League's top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, 16th-placed Everton are looking over their shoulders, just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of no wins and just one goal in his last five games in charge cost Sean Dyche his job as Everton boss. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks jumped on Wednesday, reversing a recent decline as traders responded enthusiastically to strong bank earnings and data indicating a slowdown in underlying inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.7 percent at 43,221, while the broad-based S&P 500 jumped 1.8 percent to 5,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day's largest gains came in the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which surged by 2.5 percent to end the day at 19,511.
  <br>
  <br>
  US financial heavyweights including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported soaring profits Wednesday propelled by strength in trading and financial advisory services.
  <br>
  <br>
  And fresh data showed headline inflation rose in the 12 months to December, but actually eased once volatile food and energy prices were stripped out, fueling optimism in the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of relief from the (inflation) data this morning," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones told AFP, noting there had been a positive reaction in the markets to the decline in the so-called "core" inflation measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on long-dated US Treasurys including the popular two- and 10-year notes dropped sharply as investors piled back into bonds and pushed up prices, which move inversely to yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Tesla's shares soared by 8.0 percent, as did those of Bank of New York Mellon after it reported strong quarterly earnings results. (AFP)

    Drake sues Universal over Kendrick diss track

<img alt="Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787739_1_20250116055306.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Drake on Wednesday filed suit against his own label, saying Universal Music Group's release and promotion of a Kendrick Lamar track dissing him amounted to defamation and harassment.
 <br>
  <br>
  UMG, which is behind both Drake and Lamar, adamantly denied the accusations, saying "the notion that we would seek to harm the reputation of any artist -- let alone Drake -- is illogical" given the company's longtime investment in helping him "achieve historic commercial and personal financial success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year the two superstar rappers exchanged a litany of increasingly vitriolic diss tracks, with Lamar delivering the major blow with his chart-topping, Grammy-nominated song "Not Like Us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In his suit, Drake said Universal betrayed him in favor of profits by promoting the song with punchlines that accuse him of pedophilia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the documents filed in Manhattan's federal court, Drake says Universal "approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track" that was "intended to convey the specific, unmistakable, and false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal pedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian artist born Aubrey Drake Graham, 38, says the record company chose "corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit cited the track's promotion as causing a "physical threat to Drake's safety" as well as a "bombardment of online harassment."
  <br>
  <br>
  It cited a pre-dawn shooting last May that saw a gunman wound a security guard at the superstar rapper's estate in Toronto, and described subsequent break-in attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These events were not coincidental," the suit said, before detailing the defamation allegations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake, the reigning highest-grossing rapper, is not taking legal action against Lamar, and he is not suing over the lyrics themselves. (AFP)

    Israel and Hamas agree to Gaza ceasefire deal

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 250 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, mostly women and children, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters.
  <br>
  <br>
  As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be "hell to pay" if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Biden's team to push the deal over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure and not securing a hostage deal until now.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conflict spread across the Middle East, with groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Guangdong in the first leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only goal for the SAR, playing away at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangzhou, came in the 38th minute from captain Stefan Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made a run down the left flank and the ball was eventually crossed to Lau Ka-kiu in the penalty area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lee Man forward then passed it to Pereira, who took a shot that deflected off a defender, and found its way to the back of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong side had another chance to score after the break, as Alexander Jojo headed the ball from a corner kick but was denied by the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trying to respond, the home side ramped up their attacks in the second half and it paid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jojo was penalised for a handball in the box in the 74th minute, and Guangdong substitute Jiang Zhipeng nailed the penalty to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to score any more goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played at Hong Kong Stadium next Wednesday to decide the aggregate winner. RTHK will broadcast that match live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year marked the return of the competition for the first time since 2019, and Guangdong won it in a penalty shootout.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man for attempted snatching, after the 39-year-old allegedly tried to take a police officer’s gun at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station.
 <br>
  <br>
  A statement said officers subdued the man, who was held at the station for an investigation in another case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The force said the arrested person is an off-duty officer who had earlier been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, along with two officers who subdued him, sustained injuries and was taken to hospital.

    China 'firmly opposes' new US tech curbs on smart cars

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Hong Kong on Wednesday said they had made an arrest after two women from the SAR were lured to Southeast Asia and forced to take part in scams, with the victims' families paying ransoms to get them freed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said the beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud, and will appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference earlier, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a "scam hub" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.

  <br>
  The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukrainian authorities in the west of the country on Wednesday said that critical infrastructure facilities had been targeted in a "massive" Russian missile attack.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Critical infrastructure facilities were targeted in Prykarpattia," the regional governor of the western Ivano-Frankivsk region wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Air defence forces were working in the region," the official, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said, adding there were no casualties and that the situation was "under control."
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities in the western Lviv region, which borders EU and Nato member Poland, said two critical infrastructure facilities had been hit in the Drogobych and Stryi districts, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fortunately, there were no casualties, but there was damage," governor Maksym Kozytsky wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian national grid operator meanwhile announced it was introducing emergency blackouts in seven regions including the eastern Donetsk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  The apparent barrage came just one day after Ukraine said it had carried out its largest aerial attack on Russian territory, hitting factories and energy hubs hundreds of miles from the front line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Defence Ministry confirmed the attack on Tuesday, accusing Ukraine of using US- and British-made long-range missiles and drones.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said that its forces had "carried out a group strike with precision-guided weapons and attack drones against critical gas and energy infrastructure supporting the work of Ukraine's military-industrial complex." (Agencies)

    HK saw more than 44 million visitors in 2024

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said that Hong Kong saw 44.5 million tourist arrivals in 2024, in part boosted by Beijing's relaxation of visa rules for Shenzhen residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tourism minister Rosanna Law said the figure represented a near one-third increase from the year before, and was in line with estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was a 17-percent rise from the daily average in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government will make good use of the various measures benefiting Hong Kong to promote the all-round development of Hong Kong’s tourism industry," the minister said in a written reply to the legislature.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will maintain communication with different ministries of the central government, with a view to enable more travellers from the mainland to visit the SAR in a flexible and convenient manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, noted that for the annual number of visitors, more than 10 million were from places outside the mainland, representing a 44 percent jump year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It noted that out of the 44.5 million arrivals, half of them spent at least one night in Hong Kong, and they stay for around three nights here on average.
  <br>
  <br>
  DAB lawmaker Brave Chan asked if the government would get the United Nation's culture agency, Unesco, to include Hong Kong on its list of "World Cities of Gastronomy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said there are now 50 such cities, with Macau, Chengdu, Shunde, Yangzhou, Huaian and Chaozhou the six Chinese places on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said officials will study the matter with reference to the experience of cities on the list.

    EV charging providers urged to improve transparency

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Wednesday urged charging service providers to improve transparency following complaints about electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities across Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog received 179 complaints last year on issues such as unstable power supply, insufficient charging spots and fee disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one case, an EV owner found his overnight charging sessions had been interrupted and his vehicle was left without sufficient power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another complainant reported she was charged HK$150 in idle fees without being notified – nearly ten times the actual charging cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said service providers should explain the way they set fees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a free market, they can charge according to different business models. It could be charged by kilowatts, it could be charged by time, or it could be charged by a monthly plan,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We urge the service providers to align and standardise the unit that they use."
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded EV owners to carefully review charging plans and pricing details before use, and to promptly vacate charging spots to avoid idle fees.

    'Some tumblers have lower capacity than advertised'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some brands of tumblers and travel mugs have a lower capacity than is claimed, the Consumer Council said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also found that plastic mugs are not as effective in keeping drinks hot or cold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council tested 18 models of tumblers and travel mugs, which claimed a capacity from 350ml to 900ml.
  <br>
  <br>
  But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.
  <br>
  <br>
  For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test.
  <br>
  <br>
  The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong may need to import halal food for all the Muslim tourists it aims to entice to the city, a minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plans for new measures to attract visitors from the Middle East and Southeast Asia were announced in last year's chief executive policy address.
  <br>
  <br>
  On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said as Hong Kong develops into a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, halal food could be brought in from abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong may not have many Muslims, but we need to make a lot of halal food. There are many Muslim countries in Asean, and we can attract restaurants and import food from these nations," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other government moves aimed at attracting more visitors from Muslim nations include encouraging hotels to set up worship facilities, and persuading taxi drivers to provide information in Arabic.

    'Alimony mediation helps divorcees reach settlement'

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pilot scheme which helps separating or divorcing couples from low-income families handle spouse maintenance has processed nearly 40 cases in the first two months since its introduction, taking less than a month on average to close a file.
 <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, authorities introduced a programme through the Community Care Fund to offer free mediation services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file," she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the "Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Zheng Qinwen was knocked out of the Australian Open in the biggest shock of the tournament so far, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka had to battle serve jitters to make the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fifth seed Zheng was sent packing 7-6, 6-3 at the John Cain Arena by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany, the second-oldest player in the draw at age 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over on centre court Sabalenka dropped her serve three times and faced 11 break points before overcoming Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, rattling off the last five games in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She played incredible tennis today and it was a really tough one. I expected this tennis from her, I'm really glad I was able to win this match," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win kept the Belarusian World No. 1 on course for a rare hat-trick of consecutive Australian Open titles, a feat last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis and only matched by four other women in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Olympic champion Zheng's attempt to become only the second Chinese player to win a Grand Slam singles title after Li Na is over, after being out-thought by the powerful Siegemund.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I just had to play more than my best tennis. I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free," said the German. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk said he hopes 12 Hong Kong residents who remain unlawfully detained in Southeast Asia can come home before Chinese New Year, as a six-member task force he led concluded their two-day trip to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place," he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation.

    Test strips to be used to detect space oil drug

<img alt="The rapid test kit contains a swabbing strip, a bottle of solution, a pair of surgical gloves, and a sample bag. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787604_2_20250115101808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police will begin using rapid test kits to detect a regulated sedative from Saturday to tackle the emerging use of the space oil drug.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit."
  <br>
  <br>
  The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road," Sky said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million.

    South Korea's impeached President Yoon arrested

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon has been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party who protested attempts to detain him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and are designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first-ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law as a legitimate act of governance against an "anti-state" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law enforcement officers had sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. (Agencies)

    New wildfire warnings issued as winds rise in LA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Millions of Southern Californians faced new wildfire warnings on Tuesday, and tens of thousands saw their power shut off as strong winds blew across the parched landscape around Los Angeles where two massive blazes have been burning for a week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Santa Ana winds that began gusting over the mountains before sunrise were forecast to continue until Wednesday morning with enough force to carry fire-sparking embers for miles and stoke new outbreaks in a region where at least 25 people have already been killed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Life threatening and destructive and widespread winds are already here,” LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley told a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of Southern California was under elevated fire risk, with crews on high alert from the Mexican border to Central California, far north of Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 90,000 households lost electricity as utilities shut off power to prevent their lines from sparking new blazes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weary and anxious residents were told to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police announced roughly 50 arrests, for looting, flying drones in fire zones, violating curfew and other crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest worry remained the threat from intense winds predicted to reach nearly hurricane force in some areas. Tuesday's forecast included a rare warning: The winds, combined with severely dry conditions, have created a “Particularly Dangerous Situation,” the National Weather service said, meaning that any new fire could explode in size.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gusts were forecast to pick up strength in the evening and into Wednesday before decreasing, and red-flag warnings from Central California to the Mexican border were to remain through most of Wednesday, weather service meteorologist Ariel Cohen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Planes doused homes and hillsides with bright pink fire-retardant chemicals while crews and fire engines deployed to particularly vulnerable spots with dry brush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and other officials - who were criticised over their initial response - expressed confidence that the region was ready to face the new threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  With almost no rain in more than eight months, the brush-filled region has had more than a dozen wildfires this year, mostly in the greater Los Angeles area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just under 90,000 people in the county remained under evacuation orders, half the number from last week. (AP)

    Elon Musk sued over late disclosure of Twitter stake

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

    UK launches probe into dominance of Google search

<img alt="The Competition and Markets Authority will probe whether Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others in the search engine market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787536_1_20250114213240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's competition watchdog on Tuesday launched an investigation into Google's dominant position in the search engine market and its impact on consumers and businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The investigation could lead to the US tech giant being handed "strategic market status", subjecting it to special requirements under new UK regulations, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CMA will probe whether "Google is using its position to prevent innovation by others" in the search engine market and whether it gives "self-preference" to its own services.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also look into "potential exploitative conduct" including investigating the collection and use of large quantities of consumer data without informed consent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the UK's tougher new regulation that came into force this year, the watchdog has been given more powers to develop and enforce conduct requirements on companies to prevent anti-competitive behaviour in digital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potential requirements could include Google having to make the data it collects available to other businesses or giving publishers more control over how their data is used, the CMA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A similar tech competition law from the European Union, the Digital Markets Act, carries hefty financial penalties for giants like Apple, Google and Meta in the event of infringements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services, with 90 percent of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there," CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why it's so important to ensure these services are delivering good outcomes for people and businesses and that there is a level playing field," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google is also fighting an antitrust crackdown in the United States after the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked a federal court in November to order it to sell its widely-used Chrome browser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The DOJ also asked the court to ban deals for Google to be the default search engine on smartphones and prevent it from exploiting its Android mobile operating system. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two as Manchester City's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win the 2015 to 2016 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could not have asked for more," said Liverpool manager Arne Slot. "Second half was outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong," he added. "Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had to settle for a second consecutive league draw, allowing Arsenal the chance to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long balls we won and we could run and in that moment we didn't take the right decisions," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "Maybe that would have been different but at the same time they had chances. Their strikers are really good, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are really dangerous."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night. They were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we deserved much more, especially in the first half," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The negative thing is that we changed how we played after conceding. The game was completely in our control and it's something we need to improve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th. (AFP)

    Mixed day for US stocks as market awaits bank earnings

<img alt="The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787570_1_20250115062828.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed after a choppy session as traders digested better-than-expected inflation data and looked ahead to bank earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future," Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds," said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)

    S Korea investigators in 'clash' arresting Yoon

<img alt="People gather inside the barricade blocking the road leading to the residence of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787563_1_20250115051133.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean investigators seeking to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol were involved in clashes as they tried to execute a new warrant at his official residence, Yonhap news agency reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Investigators in physical clash as they attempt to forcibly enter presidential residence," the agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came as thousands of the embattled leader's die-hard supporters massed outside the presidential residence in the capital Seoul to protect Yoon, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's short-lived December 3 imposition of martial law plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigators said they would detain anyone who tried to block their bid to execute a new warrant, after they arrived at the presidential residence Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two CIO vehicles have arrived in front of the (presidential) residence," Yonhap News TV reported, referring to the Corruption Investigation Office that is probing Yoon's declaration.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the court-ordered warrant is successfully executed, Yoon would become the first sitting president in South Korean history to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a first attempt to arrest Yoon on January 3 failed after a tense hours-long standoff with his presidential guards, who refused to budge when investigators tried to execute their warrant.
  <br>
  <br>
  A joint team of the CIO and police have since secured a new warrant and massed as many as 1,000 personnel for Wednesday's attempt to detain Yoon, according to local media reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also threatened to detain any guards who obstruct the sitting leader's arrest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Personnel who appeared to be guarding the entrance from outsiders were seen walking from the residence towards its entrance gate early Wednesday, AFP reporters saw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Supporters of Yoon were also heard chanting "illegal warrant!" while waving glow sticks and South Korean and American flags. (AFP)

    Fire-hit LA faces new peril as dangerous winds ramp up

<img alt="Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley says teams are in place ready to repel any new fires. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787545_1_20250114224256.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hot, powerful winds on Tuesday threatened to rekindle and whip up major fires that have devastated the hills and suburbs of Los Angeles, killing at least 24 people and changing the face of America's second biggest city forever.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after blazes erupted and spread uncontained, forecasters predicted "particularly dangerous" dry Santa Ana winds would spike the wildfire threat for already exhausted firefighters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stay aware of your surroundings. Be ready to evacuate. Avoid anything that can spark a fire," the National Weather Service warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  A large part of Southern California was under a Red Flag warning, indicating that intense dryness and furious winds would make conditions ripe for wildfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of Los Angeles County and much of neighbouring Ventura County were in a "Particularly Dangerous Situation," according to the NWS, a designation that was also declared before last week's deadly blazes erupted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials insisted they were poised, with Los Angeles city fire chief Kristin Crowley telling reporters a huge firefighting operation was well placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have strategically pre-positioned engine strike teams and task forces which are dedicated to rapid response for any new fire that breaks out," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The renewed danger comes with 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) of the upmarket Pacific Palisades in ruins and 14,000 acres of the city of Altadena badly charred.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90,000 evacuees are desperate to get back to their homes – or even just to see if anything at all survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My house is gone, I know that. I've seen pictures and all that's left is the chimney. But I need to see it by myself to believe it," said Fred Busche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the desperation, there were stories of fortitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeff Ridgway told how he had refused to abandon the apartment complex he manages, defending it against the fires by hauling buckets of water from the pool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was just a war," the 67-year-old said, pointing to a eucalyptus tree he extinguished when it caught fire and threatened the building last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I was just stubborn. I was like: 'I'm not going to be defeated by you. I'm sorry, this is just not gonna happen.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  Search teams using cadaver dogs have been scouring the rubble for days, with Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna saying he expected more victims would be unearthed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every day we're doing this, we're running across the remains of individual community members," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we'll continue to find remains."
  <br>
  <br>
  With so many in dire straits, the city was clutching for any sliver of good news.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was offered by the Los Angeles Rams, who beat the Minnesota Vikings in an NFL playoff game on Monday night to take them one step closer to the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game, which had been scheduled to take place in Los Angeles, was moved to Arizona to relieve pressure on stretched law enforcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Basketball fans also had a welcomed diversion from the fires when the Lakers played the San Antonio Spurs at home, although they lost 102-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers were among a dozen city sports clubs – also including the Dodgers baseball team – that have pledged US$8 million toward wildfire relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mainstay entertainment industry was also stepping up, with major studios and streamers including Netflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner and Universal parent company Comcast having all announced eight-figure donations to the recovery effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were also many stories of individual generosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a converted parking lot in Arcadia, 600 people showed up in a single day to distribute donated supplies to evacuees, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many had been redirected from other shelters that also could not accommodate the extra help.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very different experience than any other volunteering that I typically do. Because there's really no difference between the people that are helping and the people that are being helped," said 19-year-old student Gianna Karkafi.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just, like, luck." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Maro Itoje was selected on Tuesday as England's captain for the Six Nations rugby tournament, replacing Jamie George.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old lock takes the role for the first time, having previously deputised for George when the hooker has been replaced in the second half of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  George, who has had the armband since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, was demoted to vice-captain alongside Ellis Genge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itoje, who has 88 caps, was appointed as Saracens captain for this season, also ahead of George.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s a calm, influential leader, renowned for his commitment to upholding high standards and his ability to motivate those around him," England coach Steve Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His strong rapport with the squad and coaches, combined with his leadership experience at Saracens, makes him ideally placed to take on this responsibility," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borthwick has picked a 36-man squad for the Six Nations that includes No 8 Tom Willis, but is missing veteran prop Dan Cole and scrumhalf Ben Spencer. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's task force to help Hong Kong residents who were allegedly lured to Southeast Asian countries to engage in illegal work on Tuesday concluded its visit to Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, the task force arrived in the country on Sunday to follow up on the cases.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government statement said Cheuk received positive feedback in a Tuesday meeting to exchange intelligence with Thailand's senior inspector general Thatchai Pitaneelaboot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pitaneelaboot said Thai authorities will further strengthen the prevention of transnational crimes, and do their utmost to assist the safe return of Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk also met Thailand's vice minister for tourism and sports Jakkaphon Tangsutthitham and the commissioner of the tourist police bureau Saksira Pheuak-um to learn about the latest measures to protect tourists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force later met a deputy commissioner general of the Thai National Police Prachuab Wongsuk to reflect the situation of the cases involving Hong Kong residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also said Cheuk expressed gratitude to the Chinese Embassy in Thailand and Thai authorities for attaching great importance to the requests for assistance from Hong Kong people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Authorities] will continue to maintain close liaison with the embassy and the Thai authorities in the future to exchange intelligence on the latest situation of the cases, and to provide appropriate advice and all practicable assistance to the assistance seekers and their families," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force is expected to return to Hong Kong on Tuesday night.

 A British computer scientist on Tuesday urged countries to prioritise cooperation when it comes to the issue of safety in the development of artificial intelligence.

  Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible," he said. "Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day financial forum hosted some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A scholar has been convicted of killing his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with lethal gas following a retrial, with a High Court judge sentencing him to life imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br>
  A seven-member jury unanimously found Khaw Kim Sun, a former Chinese University medical professor, guilty of causing the deaths of his wife and second child, after less than four hours of deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic appeared calm when the verdict was handed down and chose not to make a mitigation plea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had been accused of putting a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide in the boot of a Mini Cooper in 2015, with the gas leaking out and killing the pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khaw was first convicted of two counts of murder in 2018 and sentenced to life behind bars.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the top court quashed his murder conviction and ordered a retrial, after ruling the initial trial judge had misdirected the jury.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the retrial that began in November last year, Khaw opted to defend himself and claimed he had bought carbon monoxide for an experiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But prosecutors challenged his claims, saying the experiment was a "sham" to hide his real motive of possessing the lethal gas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday launched a caring food coupon programme, allowing elderly people in need to taste dishes at discounted prices from the Lunar New Year holiday.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 50,000 seniors, including those living alone, will receive a set of five coupons so they can try signature dishes from five catering groups for just HK$25 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coupons will be accepted from January 29 to late March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who officiated at a launching ceremony, said he hopes the elderly people will feel warmth through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a collaboration between the government, the business sector and the community, building a harmonious and caring society together," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to test out this programme, and see how to review it based on the experience. We hope more catering groups and restaurants will participate in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the fast food chains taking part in the programme, Café de Coral, said it is a meaningful way to help the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This time, we have HK$25 baked pork chop rice, which is our signature dish. All the Café de Coral stores will offer this special price for the programme's participants," general manager Nelson Lo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other chains will offer dishes like boneless Hainan chicken rice, fish burgers, and char siu rice with sunny-side up eggs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump would have been convicted for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election result if he hadn't been elected four years later, said a report by then special counsel Jack Smith released early on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US Department of Justice's "view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not turn on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government's proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Indeed, but for Mr Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the (Special Counsel's) Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who returns to the White House on January 20, had been accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the session of Congress called to certify US President Joe Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6, 2021 by a mob of the Republican's supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith, who was special counsel appointed to investigate Trump, dropped the federal criminal case against the incoming leader after he won November's presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after the report's overnight release, Trump hit back on his Truth Social platform, calling Smith "deranged", and adding he "was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his 'boss'."
  <br>
  <br>
  "To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1am in the morning," Trump added in another post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's attorneys had earlier urged US Attorney General Merrick Garland not to release the report, calling the plan to release it "unlawful, undertaken in bad faith, and contrary to the public interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith's report details Trump's alleged efforts to persuade state-level Republican lawmakers and leaders to "change the results" of the 2020 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mr Trump contacted state legislators and executives, pressured them with false claims of election fraud in their states, and urged them to take action to ignore the vote counts and change the results," according to the report released by the Department of Justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Significantly, he made election claims only to state legislators and executives who shared his political affiliation and were his political supporters, and only in states that he had lost," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, the report alleges Trump and co-conspirators planned to organise individuals who would have served as his electors, if he had won the popular vote, in seven states where he lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- "and cause them to sign and send to Washington false certifications claiming to be the legitimate electors."
  <br>
  <br>
  They ultimately "used the fraudulent certificates to try to obstruct the congressional certification proceeding," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The special counsel office concluded that "Trump's conduct violated several federal criminal statutes and that the admissible evidence would be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed a separate case against the former and future president last year -- over Trump's handling of top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but charges are still pending against two of his former co-defendants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith left the justice department last week, days after submitting his final report as special counsel. (AFP)

    HK should cut down on red tape, survey finds

<img alt="About a third of mainland residents in Hong Kong felt the SAR could cut down on red tape. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787463_1_20250114144638.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly a third of mainland students and workers in Hong Kong said there is too much red tape in the city, according to a survey by a concern group helping young mainlanders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 800 young and educated mainlanders who are working or studying in Hong Kong, participated in an online survey jointly conducted by the Youth Expats Association and two lawmakers, Gary Zhang and Johnny Ng.
  <br>
  <br>
  The respondents were asked about their life in Hong Kong and their perspectives on the economy, culture and policies in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 30 percent said there is too much red tape in Hong Kong, such as regulations governing money transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The banking system is very troublesome if you want to make a legal transfer back to mainland China,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage.

    Serious abuse of public housing could be made a crime

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction.
  <br>
  <br>
  But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The impeachment trial of suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began on Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court deciding whether to strip him of his duties over a failed martial law bid.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It has started," the Constitutional Court's spokesperson told international media, adding that the first hearing -- out of a confirmed five -- ended minutes later with Yoon not in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following sessions will take place on January 16, 21, 23 and February 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon's December 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. (AFP)

 North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea’s military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the short-range ballistic missiles were fired from a northern inland area and flew about 250 kilometres before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

  The joint chiefs said the South Korean military had strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the US and Japanese militaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it strongly condemns the test, describing it as a “clear provocation" that poses a serious threat to the region's peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was North Korea’s second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea said the January 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong-un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the US mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea. (AP)

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday authorities will comprehensively investigate any suspected links people or organisations may have with those who endanger national security, to see if any support or assistance has been given.
 <br>
  <br>
  His comments came a day after prominent pollster Robert Chung was was taken away from his home on Monday morning, and brought to the Wong Chuk Hang office of the Public Opinion Research Institute (Pori), of which he is president and chief executive officer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that plans to redevelop a cluster of government buildings in Wan Chai will go ahead, even though his predecessor, Carrie Lam, is moving her office there.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lam's relocation to Immigration Tower later this year comes after lawmakers complained about how much public money is being spent on the rent for her current office in Pacific Place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Wan Chai redevelopment plan will go ahead as planned," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government earlier explained that Lam rented the Grade A office space in Admiralty after her term ended in 2022 because there was no room for her at offices for former CEs in Mid-Levels.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Green matched his career-high with 42 points and the Houston Rockets rallied from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 120-118 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jake LaRavia supplied the Grizzlies with a 100-87 lead when he stole the ball and sank a layup with 9:55 to play. The Rockets then began their comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were seven lead changes and two ties in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson posted 19 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two steals while teammate Alperen Sengun logged 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Cam Whitmore tallied 16 points and hit four 3-pointers off the bench. Houston made 16 of 31 from behind the arc and shot 50.6 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant paced the Grizzlies with 29 points but committed seven turnovers. Desmond Bane scored 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter for Memphis, which shot 52.9 percent but could not corral Green throughout the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston has won all three meetings with Memphis this season, two of them in the past five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 10 points as the Grizzlies jumped in from 18-11, but the Rockets answered with a 10-0 run that featured 3-pointers from Green and Dillon Brooks and yielded a 21-18 lead. Memphis responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Jaren Jackson Jr. 3-pointer that was part of a 12-2 close to the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies made 6 of 14 3-point attempts in the first and turned to their bench whenever the Rockets attempted to rally in the second. LaRavia scored 10 of Memphis' 24 first-half bench points, delivering a timely tip-in and a 3-pointer before a five-point surge from Whitmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green completed a four-point play that gave Houston a 55-54 lead, but Memphis scored the next six points and took a 60-57 halftime lead. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is doing what it can to help Hong Kong residents who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said a task force led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk has made significant progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The visit by the Security Bureau task force I think has achieved some positive results, and they have been met by the Minister of Justice in Thailand," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thailand officials have already indicated that they will attach great importance to the cases and try all their means to try to rescue those Hong Kong people who are [in captivity]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that authorities will consider various factors when deciding whether to raise Thailand's travel alert to red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have included a lot of information on the Security Bureau's web page in relation to travel information to Thailand, so I have asked the SB [Security Bureau] to update it regularly with the latest information and developments."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR officials have received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents who are allegedly being detained in various Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the other 12 remain stranded.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong passport holders can obtain tourist visas when they arrive at designated control points in Saudi Arabia starting on Wednesday, Chief Executive John Lee announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  Visitors can apply for a multiple-entry visa with stays for up to 90 days or a single-entry visa for a maximum 30-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That means holders of [an] SAR passport could visit all six members of the Cooperation Council of the Arab States, including Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman and so on," Lee told reporters on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So they could all enjoy either visa-free access or visa-on-arrival application on arrival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also from Wednesday, Saudi Arabian nationals will be able to visit Hong Kong without a visa for up to 90 days instead of 30, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Immigration Department said the new arrangements would foster closer ties between the two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These arrangements and the extension of the visa-free visit period for nationals of Saudi Arabia will enhance tourism, cultural and economic ties between the two places."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three men were injured on Tuesday when a rubbish truck was crushed by a collapsing noise barrier that had been hit by an out-of-control excavator.
 <br>
  <br>
  The excavator rolled down a slope at a construction site in Lin Tak Road, Lam Tin at around 9.40am, firefighters said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drivers of both vehicles were among those hurt, but were able to free themselves and were said to have suffered minor injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  A passenger was trapped in the truck and firefighters spent about two hours freeing him.
  <br>
  <br>
  “After conducting a risk assessment and stabilising the injured person, the Disaster Response and Rescue Team arranged a crane to secure and lift the excavator and the stone block, while simultaneously using explosive tools to create enough space to enable us to rescue him,” Assistant Divisional Officer Kao Chung-lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men aged between 25 to 50, were conscious when taken to United Christian Hospital for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were investigating the cause of the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said frontline staff and inspectors should do more to ensure site safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Working on-site we have safety personnel and construction workers. They all bear significant responsibility. In situations like this, it's important to find out whether the frontline construction workers and management did their jobs properly," said chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Edward Ma from the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said the group is really worried about serious industrial accidents occurring two days in a row, adding that safety awareness is still lacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleven people were injured in a scaffolding collapse at a construction site in Kai Tak on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The code of practice on bamboo scaffolding safety was revised in October, requiring workers to hold a valid safety training certificate before carrying out such works.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour minister Chris Sun said on Tuesday that the administration would hold a conference with relevant stakeholders to seek improvements in the industry workflow.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from looking into whether or not those involved, have fully complied with the code of practice, we have to look at, which is why we're going to hold a stakeholders conference, inviting not just those involved in scaffolding work, but also the principal contractors as well as those responsible for installing external glass walls,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's because we have to look at not just the scaffolding work itself, but also the workflow, and also the related work procedures.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the government will step up its inspections, as well as take enforcement action against those violating the law.

    Thailand still safe for tourists: travel agency boss

<img alt="Thailand is one of Hong Kong residents' favourite destinations, attracting around 1 million visitors from the SAR each year before Covid.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading travel agency said on Tuesday it has no plans to adjust the itinerary of its package tours to Thailand, amid an ongoing investigation by the Hong Kong government to see if any SAR resident was unlawfully detained there.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, EGL Tours executive director Steve Huen insisted Thailand remains safe for recreational travellers, and dismissed fears that people would be abducted on the streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out the SAR's amber outbound travel alert was issued years ago in response to mass demonstrations in Thailand, and had nothing to do with the current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Huen admitted that enquiries for travel products in the region have dropped. A few individual customers who decided to go ahead signed up for package tours because they felt safer to stick to a group, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did offer some general tips for travellers whenever they are overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When heading out at night for a drink or walk, you should be careful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You should also stay alert, and for instance, not let others exploit our kindness and trick us into into suffering financial losses."
  <br>
  <br>
  He was confident the jitters will die down soon, especially after government officials clarified on Monday that none of the Hongkongers involved in the alleged incidents of false imprisonment were abducted
  <br>
  <br>
  A task force led by Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk is expected to return from Bangkok on Tuesday evening.

<img alt="CES 2025 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787411_1_20250114100720.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Everything from autonomous snow blowers to humanoid robots filled the show floors at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Considered the World Cup of technology, the world's largest personal electronics convention wrapped up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Making their tech presence felt at the four-day event were nearly 100 registered companies from Hong Kong, more than half supported by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP).
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this year, we bring 51 companies from Hong Kong... it's actually a huge growth compared to last year. Last year we have about 18," says Derek Chim, Head of Startup Ecosystem at HKSTP.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSTP-supported companies brought in three CES Innovation Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those, Vidi Labs, demonstrated how their wearable device - with AI-driven software - could describe the surrounding environment for a visually-impaired user.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This actually proves a lot that the route that we are on is actually the right one, because a product like this not only is for Hong Kong, it's actually for the rest of the world," said Turzo Bose, co-founder & CEO of Vidi Labs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the Hong Kong Pavilion, South Korean Minji Seo - who earned her PhD in Hong Kong - displays technology that rejuvenates your eyeballs with hot yoga therapy. It's intended to help people with dry eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We create a vacuum seal, using the silicone band around the goggle, and that's the chamber that we are controlling the temperature and pressure. Our main goal to join this event was to, like, verify whether we have a market here. And we definitely verified it," said Seo, founder of Ooley Care.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong exhibitor, Michael Wong - a veteran of the Hong Kong hair care industry - uses a scanner to take images of your hair and scalp, and provide an analysis and recommendation for the right shampoo, conditioner and treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We use over millions of pictures to train our AI models so that's why it's accurate, over 90 percent. So everything just can do it within three minutes. So every American has their hair growth again, said Wong, founder and CEO of HairCoSys.
  <br>
  <br>
  His showmanship helps his startup, HairCoSys, stand out among the more than 4,500 exhibitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But so do products with unique compositions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fever Chu, co-founder of Zence Object Technology, displays everything from a TV remote that integrates recycled tea leaves, to a calculator frame composed of coffee grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are using their waste and turn it into new material and give back to them. Somehow we can help them to promote their waste product, the material, to the bigger market," said Chu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says their products have drawn plenty of interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night... over 60 [emails] within two days to the potential clients."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu says he has already heard back from many of them, confirming his belief that companies around the world want a greener supply chain.

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<img alt="Two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off a weak opening and another uptick in Treasury bond yields amid shifting monetary policy expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices began the day in the same posture as Friday's session, when equities sold off after a strong jobs report was seen as dimming the odds for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,836, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent to 19,088, well above its session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market is less overbought compared with a few weeks ago after the sluggish beginning to 2025 equity trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is showing less sensitivity to higher bond yields," Haeling said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for about US$14.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intra-Cellular, which focuses on treatments for depression and schizophrenia, jumped 34.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moderna sank 16.8 percent as it projected 2025 revenues of between US$1.5 and US$2.5 billion, falling from the 2024 level of around US$3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail shares were mixed following financial updates that included inputs from the critical holiday shopping season. Macy's dropped 8.2 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 15.6 percent but Lululemon Athletica climbed 0.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes earnings from large banks, as well as economic releases on US inflation and retail sales. (AFP)

    Biden says Gaza ceasefire deal 'on the brink'

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Monday that a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Hamas and Israel is "on the brink" of being finalised, amid growing optimism in Washington about negotiations in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the war between Israel and Hamas, we're on the brink of a proposal that I laid out in detail months ago finally coming to fruition," Biden said in a farewell speech at the State Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden has been working the phones as he seeks a prized peace deal in his final days in office before Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the proposed agreement would include a surge of aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a halt to the fighting in the enclave.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working urgently to close this deal," Biden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing US president said he would be speaking soon to Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has played a key role in negotiations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and called the ruler of mediator Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A peace deal has seemed within reach on a number of previous occasions since the Gaza war broke out following Hamas's October 6, 2023 attack on Israel, only then to collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  But optimism is growing in Washington that an agreement is possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said earlier Monday as that a truce was "close."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are close to a deal, and it can get done this week," Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not making a promise or prediction, but it is there for the taking, and we are going to work to make it happen."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sullivan said the "gaps have fundamentally narrowed down" between Israel and Hamas. (AFP)

 A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit south-western Japan, the country's meteorological agency said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centred, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9.19pm local time, according to the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tsunami can strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or go near coastal areas," the agency said on X.
  <br>

    'Thailand vows to help secure safe return of HKers'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Security chief Chris Tang on Monday said senior Thai officials have promised to do all they could to secure the safe return of Hongkongers who were reportedly lured to Southeast Asia for illegal work.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The minister of justice gave great importance of our concern, and had responded positively. [Thai authorities] said they would do their utmost to help with the safe return of the Hong Kong people," said Tang, who stressed that none of those involved were abducted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang's comments came as a task force, led by Under Secretary for Security Michael Cheuk, met Thai officials and representatives of the Chinese embassy in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  They spoke with representatives from Thailand's justice ministry who sit on the Anti Trafficking-in-Persons Committee chaired by the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheuk said he is confident that Thai authorities would do their best to help those affected, noting that Hongkongers involved had been brought to areas near borders with Myanmar and Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He declined to disclose further details, saying that the SAR government wishes to rescue these residents as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  The task force also held talks with Wu Zhiwu, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Thailand, on topics such as offering consular assistance, before meeting with staff at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the Thai capital to discuss further actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation is set to meet representatives of the Royal Thai Police on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR authorities have so far received 28 requests for assistance in relation to Hong Kong residents alleging to be detained in Southeast Asian countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixteen of these people have already returned to Hong Kong, while the remaining 12 reported that there were restrictions on their movement but were safe and able to remain in touch with the task force.

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.
